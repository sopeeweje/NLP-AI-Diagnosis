"A Unified Framework for Flexible Brain Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Data driven methods are being increasingly used to analyze brain imaging data. FMRI analyses can be put on an analytic spectrum with heavily model-based approaches (like the general linear model (GLM) implemented in the SPM software) on one end and flexible data-driven approaches like independent component analysis (ICA), principal component analysis (PCA), or clustering on the other end. In between there is a gap, which we and others have been trying to fill. In particular, methods such as ICA are particularly useful for reducing the multivariate fMRI problem down to one that is both tractable and also enables the incorporation of prior information. In the first period of this competing renewal, we focused our efforts upon developing ICA of fMRI methods which would be suitable for making group inferences, and which would allow the incorporation of prior information, hence moving from a 'blind' ICA approach to a semi-blind ICA approach. Despite the progress we have made, there is still considerable work to be done in the analysis of fMRI data with ICA. In this competing renewal, we propose to continue and significantly expand this work. First, we will extend our semi-blind ICA (sbICA) framework to provide a general framework for incorporating prior information from multiple spatial and temporal sources. In the second aim we will focus upon statistical inference and develop a framework for integrating the relevant functional components. In the third aim, we will validate the algorithms in aims 1 and 2, including using fMRI data collected on multiple days from a variety of paradigms. In this aim we develop a decision mechanism for selecting the best combination of methods given a particular problem. For the fourth aim, we will apply our methods to data collected during four well-studied paradigms in healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Our final aim involves the continuing development of our GIFT toolbox, and incorporation of the above algorithms, constraint selection mechanisms, and visual interfaces into the software. The successful completion of this research will provide a powerful set of tools for the research community to increase the sensitivity and specificity of BOLD analysis methods by drawing upon the strengths of both model-based and data-driven approaches. These tools will also provide a way to study the inter-relationship among functional networks in a flexible manner. This has application not only in schizophrenia but in many other diseases such as Alzheimer's, attention deficit hyperactivity, and psychopathy.          n/a",A Unified Framework for Flexible Brain Image Analysis,8022867,R01EB000840,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'blind', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'operation', 'psychopathic personality', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2011,466895,0.061456422472115885

"NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MAP/SEQUENCE PATTERN RECOGNITION Due both to the rapid growth of genomic data and the inherent complexity and variability of its biological significance, automated pattern recognition is critical for efficiently identifying structural and functional relationships in the genomic databases that can be used to develop effective disease therapies, drugs, and other biotechnology products.  However, current analytic techniques for pattern analysis are limited in their ability to identify significant structural and functional relationships, since interpretation of DNA/RNA patterns is required simultaneously on several levels:  linear sequence of elements, structural interactions between distant elements, structural motifs, and function.  Each of these levels interacts with other levels in complex ways, with especially strong linkages in the sequence/structure domains.  Initial efforts with neural networks have been encouraging, but fundamental extensions of network-based techniques are needed.  In particular:  (1) the interactions between distant elements of a sequence require that networks have a form of ""memory""; (2) the very large number of different pattern classes requires a form of adaptive encoding of the underlying sequential information; (3) the multiple levels of interaction of the structural and functional information require the use of more complex architectures involving multiple, interacting networks; and (4) the broad range of pattern sizes and degree of allowed variability within different pattern types require that information presented to the pattern-recognition algorithm be more robust than simple sequence data. The proposed research addresses each of these concerns by the use of modified back-propagation algorithms that allow adaptive sequence encoding and maintenance of sequence memory, by the use of coupled networks, and by the use of both linear and quadratic transforms of the raw sequence data.  n/a",NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MAP/SEQUENCE PATTERN RECOGNITION,2209126,R43HG000892,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' genetic mapping', ' human data', ' interferometry', ' mathematical model', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' nucleic acid structure']",NHGRI,"METRON, INC.",R43,1993,49959,0.02479087166318185
"Brain Dysfunction and Alcoholism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over many years, our laboratory has consistently observed significantly lower amplitudes of Event-Related Potential (ERP) components, particularly the visual P3(00), in abstinent alcoholics. In the last grant period we have identified other specific neurophysiological anomalies, notably decreased event-related frontal theta, delta and gamma band responses during cognitive tasks. Recently, we have found that some of these deficits are also predictive of relapse. We have also demonstrated that alcoholics manifest a lack of electrophysiological differentiation regardless of stimulus and task requirements for several measures, and respond more generically to different cognitive demands in a task. Most of these deficits are more related to risk (family history of alcoholism) than excessive alcohol intake, and are thus already present in high risk offspring of alcoholics prior to alcohol exposure. Our preliminary studies also indicate anomalies in neural synchrony in resting brain states in alcoholics, and impairments in synchronization during cognitive operations. We have proposed that increased Central Nervous System disinhibition may underlie these anomalies and a predisposition to develop alcohol dependence and related disorders. We have recently found that P3 amplitude is related to level of impulsivity in alcoholics, and individuals with increased impulsivity manifest reduced activation in frontal areas. Many of our results related to response inhibition strongly implicate impaired frontal lobe functioning. Our functional imaging study in high risk individuals has highlighted vulnerability in fronto- parietal circuits. The proposed project plans to further evaluate disinhibition and frontal lobe dysfunction in abstinent alcoholics by implementing novel neurophysiological paradigms that assess response activation/inhibition and their effect on course of abstinence/relapse. Novel time-frequency methods developed in our laboratory will allow us to further investigate the underlying neural oscillations and their synchrony during early and late processing during ERP tasks in several frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma), as well as their relationship to resting (baseline) EEG in alcoholics. We hypothesize that alcoholics will utilize similar/same networks for different aspects of cognitive processing, instead of specialized networks to optimize performance, and that their neural networks may not synchronize/organize effectively to produce a good signal-to-noise ratio. To further understand the biological basis of electrophysiological deficits, we propose to implement structural/functional (fMRI) imaging methods during Go/No-Go and gambling tasks and will attempt to understand the frontal circuits and localize network disruptions that are associated with response inhibition and error/outcome evaluation. Finally, we propose to use classification analyses techniques to investigate the relationships between electrophysiological measures, structural/functional indices, impulsivity and craving, that are most important in predicting relapse, and identify subgroups of alcoholics more/less likely to relapse. These findings may have important implications for cognitive, behavioral and pharmacological treatment protocols. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE R01 AA002686 The project will address important clinical challenges and basic science questions regarding the pathophysiology of cognitive and neurophysiological deficits in alcoholics that cause them to repeatedly drink despite adverse outcomes. It is of utmost importance to elucidate the underlying predisposition for the overwhelming urge to drink (craving) resulting in recidivism to inform prevention strategies.

Novel time-frequency methods developed in our laboratory will allow us to further investigate the underlying neural oscillations and their synchrony during early and late processing during ERP tasks in several frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma), as well as their relationship to resting (baseline) EEG in alcoholics. We hypothesize that alcoholics will utilize similar/same networks for different aspects of cognitive processing, instead of specialized networks to optimize performance, and that their neural networks may not synchronize/organize effectively to produce a good signal-to-noise ratio. To further understand the biological basis of electrophysiological deficits, we propose to implement structural/functional (fMRI) imaging methods during Go/No-Go and gambling tasks and will attempt to understand the frontal circuits and localize network disruptions that are associated with response inhibition and error/outcome evaluation. Finally, we propose to use classification analyses techniques to investigate the relationships between electrophysiological measures, structural/functional indices, impulsivity and craving, that are most important in predicting relapse, and identify subgroups of alcoholics more/less likely to relapse. These findings may have important implications for cognitive, behavioral and pharmacological treatment protocols. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE R01 AA002686 The project will address important clinical challenges and basic science questions regarding the pathophysiology of cognitive and neurophysiological deficits in alcoholics that cause them to repeatedly drink despite adverse outcomes.

"Brain Dysfunction and Alcoholism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over many years, our laboratory has consistently observed significantly lower amplitudes of Event-Related Potential (ERP) components, particularly the visual P3(00), in abstinent alcoholics. In the last grant period we have identified other specific neurophysiological anomalies, notably decreased event-related frontal theta, delta and gamma band responses during cognitive tasks. Recently, we have found that some of these deficits are also predictive of relapse. We have also demonstrated that alcoholics manifest a lack of electrophysiological differentiation regardless of stimulus and task requirements for several measures, and respond more generically to different cognitive demands in a task. Most of these deficits are more related to risk (family history of alcoholism) than excessive alcohol intake, and are thus already present in high risk offspring of alcoholics prior to alcohol exposure. Our preliminary studies also indicate anomalies in neural synchrony in resting brain states in alcoholics, and impairments in synchronization during cognitive operations. We have proposed that increased Central Nervous System disinhibition may underlie these anomalies and a predisposition to develop alcohol dependence and related disorders. We have recently found that P3 amplitude is related to level of impulsivity in alcoholics, and individuals with increased impulsivity manifest reduced activation in frontal areas. Many of our results related to response inhibition strongly implicate impaired frontal lobe functioning. Our functional imaging study in high risk individuals has highlighted vulnerability in fronto- parietal circuits.

"Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  	The candidate Dr. Helen Weng is seeking a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award for her immediate career goal to gain mentorship and training to develop the EMBODY Task, a more objective and precise fMRI measure of meditation practice that uses multivariate brain pattern classification methods. Dr. Weng earned her doctorate in clinical psychology researching the neurobiological mechanisms of compassion meditation with Dr. Richard Davidson, an expert in contemplative neuroscience. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in a NCCIH T32-funded fellowship, where she is studying mindful body awareness using neuroscientific and psychophysiological methods. Dr. Weng is rigorously trained in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study contemplative neuroscience; however, she is primarily trained in using standard univariate analyses, which collapse across spatial and temporal information within fMRI data. She recognized the potential limitations of these methods to study the complex and fluctuating mental states that occur during meditation practice, and aims to develop novel fMRI tasks that use multivariate methods (which utilize spatial and temporal variability within fMRI data) to study brain states trained by meditation. Obtaining this K08 to develop the EMBODY Task would support Dr. Weng’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). 	Dr. Weng’s career development plan includes training in the cognitive neuroscience of attention, fMRI pattern classification, and clinical trial methods to study meditation training. Dr. Weng has assembled a stellar mentoring team including top experts in cognitive neuroscience, mindfulness-based interventions, and pattern classification. Her primary sponsor and mentor, Dr. Adam Gazzaley (Director of the UCSF Neuroscience Imaging Center), is a world-class expert in the cognitive neuroscience of attention and neuroplasticity induced by app-based trainings.

Her team also includes experts in fMRI pattern classification methodology (Dr. Bin Yu, Chancellor’s Professor, UC Berkeley; Dr. Melina Uncapher, UCSF) and cognitive neuroscience of internal attention (Dr. David Ziegler, UCSF). Dr. Weng’s training environment is at UCSF, a top NIH-funded research institution, and she will have access to state-of-the-art neuroimaging facilities at the Neuroscience Imaging Center and resources from OCIM, a flagship center for studying meditation. She will regularly meet and communicate with her mentorship team, and complete coursework, fMRI workshops, and training programs to fulfill her training goals. Dr. Weng’s K08 research proposal aims to develop the EMBODY Task, a novel fMRI task that uses brain pattern classification to decode the focus of attention during a period of breath meditation. This task will more accurately measure mental states during meditation by using precise information from individuals’ unique neural signatures. The task will distinguish neural patterns associated with attention (breath attention) and inattention (mind wandering) to the breath, and use these patterns to identify fluctuating brain states during ten minutes of breath meditation. This will produce objective brain-derived metrics of breath attention such as percentage time spent in breath attention, which can then be used to objectively assess outcomes of meditation training. She will pilot, develop, and validate this task within long-term practitioners, meditation novices, and a separate group of novices who go through mobile app-based meditation training. Dr. Weng will use this data to prepare a future R61/R33 proposal that will use the EMBODY Task to more rigorously test the mechanisms of action of how mindfulness-based interventions improve clinical outcomes by training meditation skills.

"Integrating literature and experimental data for druggability methods ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder that affects one percent of the general population and leads to an increased risk of homelessness and suicide. Because the genetic component underlying schizophrenia is not well understood, a patient's symptoms are usually the focus of treatment. With limited drug classes for treatment, schizophrenia is a prime candidate for drug repurposing. Over the last decade, drug development has remained stagnant even with the reference genome and an abundance of experimental data. Due to the high development cost and likelihood of failing during clinical trials, drug discovery has focused on an estimated 3000 druggable human genes; however, this narrow focus has severely limited the potential for discovery. With an estimated 3000 druggable human genes, great potential remains for discovery of new drugs and novel uses for current drugs from a variety of sources, including literature and gene expression data. Literature is the most comprehensive resource for known information and, more specifically, high quality low- throughput data. Due to the availability of high-throughput experimental data, many computational methods for drug discovery and repurposing have focused on incorporating this data into their algorithms; however, data extracted from the literature is equally valuable. To investigate druggability using literature and experimental data, I propose the following specific aims: (1) integrate drug, gene, and disease relationships from the literature and experimental data sources; (2) infer druggable proteins using networks of protein, drug, and disease interactions with experimental data; and (3) apply the network model to schizophrenia to predict novel druggable proteins for drug repurposing. With success, I will create a novel methodology to integrate literature and high-throughput experimental data and apply this methodology to discover novel druggable proteins related to schizophrenia that can inform future drug repurposing studies.         Project Narrative Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects one percent of the general population and leads to increase risk of homelessness and suicide. Discovery of novel druggable proteins will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug-gene interactions that treat a disease. This work has the potential to inform future drug development to improve treatment of schizophrenia and many other diseases.",Integrating literature and experimental data for druggability methods,9123329,F31LM012354,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biotechnology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth', 'Homelessness', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'gene interaction', 'improved', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'severe mental illness', 'success', 'text searching']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,40790,0.018246550360886165
"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets.",Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data,9941499,R01LM013337,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'scale up', 'social health determinants', 'stem', 'structured data', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,348397,0.025679271423590222
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Improving the Detection of Activation in High Resolution fMRI using Multivariate DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a local multivariate analysis software package for fMRI data analysis. It will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods. This project will lead to better brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function. Mass-univariate analysis, such as the general linear model (GLM), is the prevailing fMRI data analysis method. However, it suffers from blurring of edges of activation and potential elimination of the detection of weak activated regions due to routinely applied fixed isotropic spatial Gaussian smoothing. Local multivariate methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants have been shown to significantly increase the detection power of fMRI activations and improve activation maps. As an advantage, CCA uses adaptive spatial filtering kernels to accurately extract the signal better in a noisy environment. However, there are several drawbacks, particularly low spatial specificity, long computational time, and single-factor experimental design limitation. Furthermore, a parametric estimation method does not exist to determine the family-wise error rate, no extension to group analysis has been investigated, and no studies extending local CCA to nonlinear CCA for fMRI data using kernel methods have been systematically carried out. All these drawbacks prevent local CCA methods from being widely accepted in neuroscience research in fMRI. In this proposal, our goals are to eliminate these drawbacks using novel local multivariate analysis methods (based on CCA) and to develop a software tool to widen its broader application in the neuroscience research community. We expect this software tool to be particularly valuable for neuroscience research where detections of weak activations or spatially localized patterns of activations are desired. As high resolution imaging and computer power advance, we expect an increase in demand for this software tool, thus advancing new discoveries of brain function and more precise spatial localization of activations. As a particular application, we will focus on studying memory actions using a novel event-related recognition paradigm to investigate the effects of familiarity and recollection in subregions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) for high resolution fMRI. This research will advance our understanding of hippocampal/MTL contributions to memory, which can substantially advance our understanding of the memory deficits associated with a number of debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions that show abnormalities in these regions, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer¿s disease, schizophrenia, and major depression. More generally, it will provide psychologists and neuroscientists a more powerful tool to analyze their fMRI data using advanced multivariate methods.

Our proposed fMRI analysis methods also have great potential for significantly advancing our understanding of other neurological and psychiatric conditions.                ",Improving the Detection of Activation in High Resolution fMRI using Multivariate,8438968,R01EB014284,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Pattern', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'improved', 'interest', 'memory recognition', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIBIB,RYERSON  UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,279190,0.08126693091701843
"Concept Representation in the Human Brain Concepts are the building blocks of human cognition, providing the basic content for language, episodic memory, social interaction, planning, and many other essential capabilities. Modern evidence suggests that human conceptual knowledge is represented in a widely distributed and hierarchically organized system involving much of the brain. Despite the central importance of this cognitive domain, there are large gaps in our understanding of very fundamental issues concerning how concepts are represented and organized at a systems level. This project addresses several of these gaps using a novel, high-dimensional, biologically based model of word meaning that captures the extent to which a concept is derived from various types of sensory, action, emotional, spatial, temporal, and cognitive experiences. We use this model in a series of information-based analyses of fMRI data and multivariate analyses of lesion-deficit correlations in patients with stroke. Our main hypothesis is that much of conceptual knowledge is represented in abstract form within content-specific experiential networks and multi-level convergences between these networks. Aim 1 is to clarify the detailed architecture of these hierarchical convergences, including intermediate crossmodal networks that we hypothesize arise in the brain due to proximity of neural processing streams and systematic covariation between experiential dimensions. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that event concepts (e.g., PARTY, ACCIDENT, SNEEZE) are primarily represented in inferior parietal convergence networks due to strong contributions from motion, action, spatial, and temporal experiences in the formation of these concepts, whereas object concepts have stronger representation in temporal lobe convergence networks that capture static multisensory experiences. Aim 3 is to clarify how concept categories are differentially represented and how this organization gives rise to category-related impairments in patients with focal brain damage. We hypothesize that neural representations of both concrete and abstract categories emerge from differently weighted mixtures of experiential information at high levels in the representational hierarchy. The high-dimensional, experiential representation of word meaning on which these hypotheses are based, combined with advanced fMRI techniques for mapping information content, makes it possible to address these basic knowledge gaps systematically for the first time. Combining state-of-the-art lesion-deficit correlation analyses with these healthy brain fMRI studies provides a powerful means of establishing causal links between fMRI activity patterns and successful concept retrieval. Understanding this large, complex, and particularly human brain system has far- reaching implications for understanding a range of neurological conditions that impair knowledge representation and retrieval, is likely to be transformative in the realm of functional mapping for brain surgery, and will be a prerequisite for developing rational and effective rehabilitation strategies for such patients, including future therapies involving modulatory stimulation, brain-machine interfaces, and biological repair. Concept knowledge, such as knowledge of the features that define different kinds of objects, people, places, and events, is essential to every aspect of human life, but our understanding of how the brain stores this knowledge is very incomplete.

"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive.

"Network encoding of short-term memory in primary auditory cortex Project Summary/Abstract  Short-term memory (STM) is a fundamental component of hearing that is critical to speech comprehension and auditory communication. Mounting evidence has indicated that the activity in primary auditory cortex (A1) changes when we perform auditory tasks. In this project, our long-term objective is to understand how A1 changes its neural activity and connectivity during the maintenance of auditory STM.  We will study how auditory STM is encoded in the structure of neural networks in A1 layer 2/3 (L2/3). We choose to study L2/3 because auditory STM involves an intracortical circuit, and L2/3 is dense in intracortical connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, the representation of STM in neural network structure has not been studied in A1. To explore this topic, we will have animals compare two sequential sounds that are separated by a silent delay. The animals must memorize the first sound to compare with the second sound to give a correct behavioral response during the task. We will record neuronal responses in A1 L2/3 while the animals perform this task. We hypothesize that the neural networks that arise during the first sound will be sustained during the delay until the second sound. We will use both simple and complex sounds to understand how acoustic complexity affects neuronal network structure. Furthermore, we will determine if there exists a stimulus-invariant representation of acoustic periodicity, i.e., `pitch', in neuronal networks. Our preliminary results suggest that neural activity in auditory cortex depends on if the animal successfully discriminates between high vs. low frequency pure-tones. Thus, our results shed light on how the brain's auditory responsiveness depends on how we listen and react to sound.  Listening can be challenging for both healthy and hearing-impaired people. Our studies will help clarify the basic understanding of how the brain allows us to listen. As a result, our work will contribute to future therapies designed to enable better hearing in every-day settings.

Our studies will shed light on how neuronal networks in the brain encode our perceptions and memories of sound.",Network encoding of short-term memory in primary auditory cortex,9732900,R21DC017829,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Decision Making', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Maintenance', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Music', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Training', 'Work', 'awake', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'graph theory', 'hearing impairment', 'information organization', 'neural network', 'normal hearing', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'therapy design', 'two-photon']",NIDCD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2019,154500,0.01295941308650001

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods.

"The role of short-term memory uncertainty in visual decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to gain a fundamental quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of visual short-term memory (VSTM) in health. VSTM is a central aspect of human cognition, allowing people to detect changes in the environment. Deficits in VSTM are found in many visual and neurological disorders, including visual neglect, parietal and frontal lobe damage, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, traumatic brain injury, and schizophrenia. A better characterization of VSTM may lead the way to better diagnosis and treatment of such deficits.  In its first period, this project has overturned established beliefs about the nature of the limitations of VSTM. The continuation of the project focuses on the richness of VSTM and in particular the hypothesis that VSTM contains a representation of uncertainty associated with a short-term memory. To test this hypothesis, the investigators use a set of novel behavioral tasks, some of which involve subjects directly reporting their confidence about a memory, while others are designed such that decision performance benefits from utilizing knowledge of VSTM uncertainty. In contrast to other work that uses stimuli such as line drawings or letters, all experiments in this project use simple, single-feature stimuli, allowing for both tight experimental control and precise mathematical modeling.  The project integrates mathematical modeling with the experiments in an essential way. The Ma laboratory is a leader in the large-scale testing of mathematical models of behavior, comparing them using state-of-the-art statistical techniques, and using the results to inform further experimental design. The models in this project are aimed at precisely characterizing the processes by which the brain arrives at a VSTM-based decision. One large category of models that will be tested is based on the notion that observers optimally or near-optimally combine VSTM information with prior and reward information to reach a decision. Beyond behavioral models, the project will use neural network modeling to address how neural circuits might implement the computations involved in the behavioral tasks of the project. Specifically, the investigators ask how the brain can incorporate knowledge of VSTM uncertainty without being explicitly trained on the correct value of uncertainty.  The broader impact of the project consists of connecting two traditionally disparate research areas, namely the study of VSTM and the study of decision-making. Besides potential clinical applications, the project will lead to a better basic understanding of how the brain manages to make good decisions in the face of great uncertainty. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in visual short-term memory are found in many forms of brain damage and disease, including visual neglect, parietal and frontal lesions, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we propose to better characterize, through experiment and theory, the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying visual short-term memory, with the eventual goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",The role of short-term memory uncertainty in visual decision-making,9554915,R01EY020958,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Color', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Performance', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'logarithm', 'mathematical model', 'neglect', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,237795,0.030840121721419905
"The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol-dependent individuals frequently have deficits in self-control, as measured by their excessive discounting of delayed rewards. The dual neurobehavioral decision systems model suggests that these deficits may result from a disruption in the regulatory balance between two interacting neurobiological systems. These systems are the executive system (prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex) which is responsible for valuing delayed rewards (i.e., long-term goals), and the impulsive system (limbic and paralimbic areas) which is associated with immediate rewards (i.e., instant gratification). Our recent research has demonstrated that working memory (WM) training repairs self-control, putatively by restoring regulatory balance between these systems. There is, however, still much to learn about repairing self-control.  In Aim 1, we will further explore the effects WM training on a range of WM, self-control, and clinically relevant (e.g., craving) measures. Additionally, the neural mechanisms of WM training will be explored though functional neuroimaging techniques. We will examine the dose-effect function of WM training by systematically varying the number of WM training sessions across several groups of alcohol-dependent individuals. The duration of these improvements in self-control will be tested by conducting follow-up assessments one month, three months, and six months after training.  In Aim 2 we plan to capitalize on the neurobiological knowledge gained in Aim 1 to test the effects of two variants of real time fMRI neuro-feedback on our suite of WM, self-control, and clinically significant measures. This novel exploration of neuro-feedback effects on neurocognitive and clinically significant measures will include a direct comparison of feedback techniques based on a specific brain region and across a distributed neural network. Long-term changes in neural function and/or our neurocognitive measures will be explored during a one-month follow-up visit.  Successfully achieving our aims could allow us to both refine our current techniques (i.e., WM training), and possibly begin the process of developing novel techniques (i.e., neuro-feedback) for the repair of self-control in alcohol-dependent individuals. This application will contribute to personalized medicine approaches in alcohol dependence, where treatment is defined by documented self-control deficits. Furthermore, the functional neuroimaging data collected across both aims should provide unique insights into both patterns of neural disruption seen in alcohol dependence and any treatment associated changes in neural function.

"The Repair of Self Control in Alcohol Dependence: Working Memory & Real Time fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol-dependent individuals frequently have deficits in self-control, as measured by their excessive discounting of delayed rewards. The dual neurobehavioral decision systems model suggests that these deficits may result from a disruption in the regulatory balance between two interacting neurobiological systems. These systems are the executive system (prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex) which is responsible for valuing delayed rewards (i.e., long-term goals), and the impulsive system (limbic and paralimbic areas) which is associated with immediate rewards (i.e., instant gratification). Our recent research has demonstrated that working memory (WM) training repairs self-control, putatively by restoring regulatory balance between these systems. There is, however, still much to learn about repairing self-control.  In Aim 1, we will further explore the effects WM training on a range of WM, self-control, and clinically relevant (e.g., craving) measures. Additionally, the neural mechanisms of WM training will be explored though functional neuroimaging techniques. We will examine the dose-effect function of WM training by systematically varying the number of WM training sessions across several groups of alcohol-dependent individuals. The duration of these improvements in self-control will be tested by conducting follow-up assessments one month, three months, and six months after training.  In Aim 2 we plan to capitalize on the neurobiological knowledge gained in Aim 1 to test the effects of two variants of real time fMRI neuro-feedback on our suite of WM, self-control, and clinically significant measures. This novel exploration of neuro-feedback effects on neurocognitive and clinically significant measures will include a direct comparison of feedback techniques based on a specific brain region and across a distributed neural network. Long-term changes in neural function and/or our neurocognitive measures will be explored during a one-month follow-up visit.  Successfully achieving our aims could allow us to both refine our current techniques (i.e., WM training), and possibly begin the process of developing novel techniques (i.e., neuro-feedback) for the repair of self-control in alcohol-dependent individuals. This application will contribute to personalized medicine approaches in alcohol dependence, where treatment is defined by documented self-control deficits. Furthermore, the functional neuroimaging data collected across both aims should provide unique insights into both patterns of neural disruption seen in alcohol dependence and any treatment associated changes in neural function.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions.

One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,0.0352630004997331
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics.

"SVM based group data analysis for drug abuse disorder ASL perfusion study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI provides a potentially extremely useful tool for drug abuse/addiction studies due to the noninvasive cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement and immunity to low frequency MR signal drift effects that degrade functional MRI based on BOLD contrast over time. However, data processing through conventional univariate general linear model (GLM) based methods has proved extremely challenging for ASL data due to its intrinsic low SNR, the increased motion and agitation typically present during drug craving states, and the ""patchy flow"" defects commonly found in the brains of patients with certain types of chronic substance abuse (e.g., cocaine). Assuming a linear brain response to the functional stimuli and ignoring the abundant spatial brain activity coupling, the standard GLM is initially sub-optimal for fMRI data analysis. Modeling each voxel's time series with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), it may be further ill-posed to drug abuse studies since the actual shape of HRF may differ significantly in the addicted patient's brain from the canonical one and may differ significantly from patient to patient, from voxel to voxel. A more powerful data analysis method is fundamentally demanded for drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion studies. The goal of this project is to develop a multivariate and brain response modeling-free fMRI data processing method and to use it for revealing the drug craving related brain activation patterns within existing drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion fMRI data in our center. A machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), will be used to extract a spatial discriminance map between different experimental conditions for each subject, and a statistic framework will be provided to give a population inference about the extracted discriminance (Aim 1). We hypothesize that this machine-learning based data processing will increase the detection sensitivity of ASL perfusion fMRI as compared to the conventional GLM approach because of the data driven nature and multivariate processing of SVM. To verify this hypothesis and to validate the sensitivity, specificity and reliability of the proposed methods, we propose to acquire 40 normal controls' null-hypothesis ASL perfusion fMRI data and sensory-motor task data in Aim 2. The last but the most important aim (Aim 3) is to apply the proposed method to analyze the existing drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion fMRI data in our center. In addition to the basic science implications for ASL perfusion fMRI and BOLD fMRI, we believe this line of work will provide critical information, e.g., more precise diagnostic measurement, and prediction of treatment or medication response for the current cocaine and nicotine addiction/relapse vulnerability studies. The output of these more powerful ASL data analysis methods will also pave the way for general application of ASL perfusion fMRI methods across multiple brain disorders, and for sustained states within the normal brain.          n/a",SVM based group data analysis for drug abuse disorder ASL perfusion study,7385333,R03DA023496,"['Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronic', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spin Labels', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stimulus', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'computerized data processing', 'craving', 'drug craving', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'nicotine craving', 'response', 'size', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2007,236250,0.03132719977858139
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets.

The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,0.023552508296218036
"A framework for developing translatable intelligent neural interface systems for precision neuromodulation therapies Despite advances in neuromodulation technology, therapeutic devices are often ineffective or have adverse side effects. Next-generation closed-loop neuromodulation systems will provide great potentials for improving the therapeutic outcome by sensing the neural states and adapting the neuromodulatory actions. These systems will provide powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms of treatment by elucidating the causal link between regulating the physiological states and the therapeutic or the behavioral outcomes. However, a lack of systematic approach to optimally control neurostimulation is a major barrier to fully utilize their potentials. Furthermore, the real-time implementation of advanced optimization and control algorithms requires powerful computing hardware that pose a major challenge for translating the effective neural interface systems into implantable or wearable devices with limited power supply. The proposed project is addressing these two problems by developing an open-source end-to-end platform, called NeuroWeaver, to design, test and deploy intelligent Closed-Loop Neuromodulation (iCLON) systems that automatically can learn the optimal neuromodulation control policies by interacting with the nervous system. We cast the problem of optimizing neuromodulation into reward-based learning where achieving the desired neural state or the therapeutic outcome represents a measure of reward for the iCLON system. We will use techniques from reinforcement learning and model predictive control to develop algorithms that enable iCLON systems learn the optimal actions to maximize their reward. Memory dysfunction is one of the most devastating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementia. We will develop the NeuroWeaver platform in the context of designing iCLON systems to induce good memory states in the hippocampus by closed-loop amygdala stimulation. Optimizing the memory- enhancing effects of amygdala stimulation will have immediate benefits to research on treatments for memory disorders.

"Information Processing and Age-Related Declines in General Cognitive Abilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animal research on age-related cognitive deficits has typically focused on the impact of aging on specific learning tasks or domains. While informative regarding the brain substrates for task- specific (or even domain-specific) learning impairments, this approach provides little insight into the impact of aging on general cognitive/learning abilities. The prevailing focus on isolated tasks or domains has limited our understanding of ""cognitive aging"", as it has been estimated that 35-60% of age-related declines in cognitive performance are attributable to a diminishment of individuals' general cognitive ability, i.e., the capacity for cognitive performance that transcends the specific demands of any single task or domain. We have developed unique testing and analysis regimens that are sensitive to a general learning factor that accounts for >32% of the variance in the general cognitive performance of young adult laboratory mice. We have begun to apply this approach to studies of animals across the life span, and have isolated a general cognitive factor in 20 month old BALB-C mice that accounts for greater than 40% of the variance in the general cognitive abilities of these animals. While comparable in structure to that of young animals, in old animals this ""general cognitive factor"" consistently accounts for a greater proportion of the total variance in the cognitive performance of aged animals, suggesting that general cognitive abilities become increasingly dominant across the animal's life span. Moreover, we have established that in aged animals, general cognitive abilities become increasingly reliant on aspects of working memory, particularly, working memory span (resistance to decay) and working memory capacity (resistance to interference). Furthermore, general cognitive declines do not accrue homogeneously across the life span, such that some percentage of aged animals retain their cognitive abilities, while in others, these abilities decline rapidly, an effect associated with increasing body mass and decreases in general activity. We now hypothesize that the general cognitive decline in aged animals is the consequence of perturbations in the efficacy of the working memory system, including working memory span, capacity, and selective attention. We will test these possibilities in Aims 1 and 2, and in so doing, will gain critical insight into the processes that underlie age-related cognitive declines. It will then be possible in Aim 3 to test specific behavioral strategies (including manipulations of body weights, activity, and working memory efficacy) to innoculate animals against these declines, and possibly, to mitigate the progression of age-related declines that were previously instantiated.

"Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI Project Summary/Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool both clinically and in scientific research, with broad applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to presurgical planning. FMRI can generate whole brain neuronal activation maps, yet it is an inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) method due to the relatively small changes in activation signal relative to the baseline signal. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate robust, high SNR fMRI by using a novel acquisition method, oscillating steady state (OSS) fMRI, along with machine learning (ML) techniques, to reconstruct high-quality images of the OSS fMRI data. OSS fMRI can increase SNR by >2x compared to the current state-of-the-art in fMRI acquisition methods, and this boost is roughly equivalent to the SNR gain going from a 3T MRI scanner to a 7T MRI scanner. The SNR increase is a direct result of the steady state approach. However, with a more complex, oscillating acquisition, OSS fMRI can be more susceptible to common MRI artifacts than traditional methods if left uncorrected. Two of the most common sources of MRI artifacts are changes in the main magnetic field (B0) due to physiological noise (such as respiration) and patient motion. This project will develop robust, high SNR fMRI at 3T by incorporating the effects of (1) B0 changes and (2) patient motion into the OSS signal model and image reconstruction algorithms. A new image reconstruction that incorporates neural networks will correct for B0 fluctuations and remove B0 induced artifacts. We will train a neural network to generate B0 field maps using data from a conventional, physics-based two echo field mapping technique to implicitly incorporate prior information of the physics into the reconstruction, while also providing a fast, ML-based field mapping method. To correct for subject motion, we will develop a neural network that estimates rigid-body motion parameters from sequential image frames in the fMRI scan. These motion parameters will be used in an iterative image reconstruction to produce high-quality resting-state and task-based fMRI, even in the presence of subject motion. The technology developed in this proposal will result in improved functional MRI that has the potential to significantly advance both the study of the human brain and the treatment of neurological disorders. The University of Michigan is one of the top research universities in the US, and provides an ideal environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed research strategy. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UM have all the necessary hardware and computational resources needed for this project, including two state-of-the-art GE 3T MRI scanners and extensive GPU hardware for the machine learning components of the project. Furthermore, Drs. Jeffrey Fessler and Douglas Noll have proven expertise in fMRI image acquisition and reconstruction, as well as extensive mentorship experience, that will help guide this project and my training. Project Narrative Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure brain function, and it has revolutionized our understanding of cognitive processes during the last 25 years and has also been used as a tool for presurgical mapping of language and other sensitive brain regions. More recently, fMRI is being used as a biomarker for the progression of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depression. In this project we will improve fMRI techniques by developing new methods that are more robust to common sources of MRI image degradation, which will improve the sharpness of the fMRI images without increasing instrumentation costs.","Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI",10067072,F32EB029289,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Left', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic Process', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'magnetic field', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'progression marker', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2020,64926,-0.0045663541603584
"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

"Independent Component Analysis Based Support Vector Machine Classification Method    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have provided the addiction field with a unique and profoundly valuable ability to explore brain mechanisms in human subjects. Despite the resultant advances in our understanding of neural mechanisms, the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging methods has not been realized. In addition, our ability to assess the reactivity of neural networks over time remains limited. To explore new approaches to further our understanding and diagnosis of substance use disorders, this proposal will utilize novel and powerful analytic methods to assess an existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set in cocaine-addicted subjects and healthy controls. The PI, new to the substance abuse field, will bring analytic approaches developed in other areas of investigation to the field of addiction. The broad goal of this project is to examine differentiations of brain functions in cocaine-addicted subjects using fMRI data and to reveal functional connectivity between regions involving disinhibition and decision-making tasks. This study will exploit data from an ongoing NIDA-funded study, ""Impulsivity, Neural Deficits and Cocaine Addiction."" This study assesses BOLD response during a motor disinhibition task and a decision- making task of response reversal as well as basal measures of interconnectivity measures during rest. A data driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), will be used to extract spatially independent regions that show differences in addicted and control subjects (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the proposed method will identify certain groups of voxels (not necessarily spatially connected) serving separation of two groups who are under disinhibition and decision-making tasks. To uncover how the functional connectivity changes over time between those differentiated regions, we will perform dynamic (changes over short time) dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analysis using various window sizes on time course (Aim 2). These findings are expected to reveal a temporal distinction between ICA-derived network changes in cocaine-addicted and healthy control populations. Since the first aim will find significantly discriminative clouds of voxels, we will use a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machines (SVM), to automatically map a subject into one of the groups, cocaine-addicted or control, by using subject's fMRI data (Aim 3). We hypothesize that SVM based subject classification tool will provide high sensitivity in selection between the two groups. The framework potentially offers a useful clinical diagnostic instrument as well as demonstrating key brain neural differences between the groups. The last aim is designed to reveal dynamic connectivity between pairs of given anatomic regions of relevance, such as the mesial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior PFC, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the disinhibition task) and the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the decision-making task). We hypothesize that a clear boundary will be observed in interaction patterns of two groups regarding two tasks. The contrast between brain regions in fMRI data of cocaine-addicted and control subjects will be investigated for the first time using very powerful data analysis tool (ICA) and will be used in classification framework of SVM. The proposal will bring together two extremely innovative techniques (DFNC and SVM) and a promising junior investigator into the field of addiction. The utilization of a pre-existing database offers a highly cost-effective approach to a clinically important, perplexing and persistent problem in the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs. While biologically-oriented studies, particularly those using imaging techniques, have produced significant advances in our understanding of brain activity relevant to the development and persistence of addiction, this knowledge has done little to assist in the diagnosis of these disorders. This study will bring statistical procedures used in other fields of research to imaging data obtained from cocaine-addicted subjects to assess changes in brain networks and determine whether the cocaine-addicted patients can be distinguished from non-cocaine using subjects.            The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes.

"FRAGILE X WORKING MEMORY: A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL Fragile X syndrome (fra(X)) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It is characterized by constellation of impairments in linguistic, cognitive, social, and sensory/motor skills. Theories differ regarding the underlying psychological cause of the cognitive phenotype; however, many researchers agree that those with Fra(X) experience problems with working memory. A working memory deficient would express itself most profoundly in sequencing tasks. Those with fra(X) perform poor than those behavioral model and simulates task performance with an with an artificial neural network. The network model is based on me urological substrates discovered to be significantly different in those with fra(X); in particular, the hippocampus (HC) appears to be larger. The model will use data from a modified ""n-back"" task, the sequential card playing tasks. Simultaneous processing matched typically developing participants and those with fra(X) will play this experimenter-designed card game. In this task they will be required to recall either one, two, three, or four cards in a row. The neural network will simulate how these two different populations perform. Those with fra(X) may have an abundance of neurons in the HD; paradoxically, having too many neurons leads to poor memory and slower learning. These neurons are represented by hidden units in the network model, and an overabundance of hidden units means that the model does not abstract important elements from the environment. The network too much idiosyncratic, moist, and extraneous information and this is infelicitous for sequencing. Proper sequencing relies on the activation and storage of meaningful, well-abstracted neuronal patterns. The specific aims of this grant are 1) to complete the development of a game-like, sequential card playing task that can be used to assess visual working memory in a motivating manner, 2) to compare fra(X) and typical populations' performance on the card task, and 3) to implement a neural network that will provide a neurologically-motivated, more process- oriented account of the working memory differences between the two populations. In addition, by adjusting the parameters of the neural network model, individual differences within the fra(X) population can be stimulated.

"FRAGILE X WORKING MEMORY: A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL Fragile X syndrome (fra(X)) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It is characterized by constellation of impairments in linguistic, cognitive, social, and sensory/motor skills. Theories differ regarding the underlying psychological cause of the cognitive phenotype; however, many researchers agree that those with Fra(X) experience problems with working memory. A working memory deficient would express itself most profoundly in sequencing tasks. Those with fra(X) perform poor than those behavioral model and simulates task performance with an with an artificial neural network. The network model is based on me urological substrates discovered to be significantly different in those with fra(X); in particular, the hippocampus (HC) appears to be larger. The model will use data from a modified ""n-back"" task, the sequential card playing tasks. Simultaneous processing matched typically developing participants and those with fra(X) will play this experimenter-designed card game. In this task they will be required to recall either one, two, three, or four cards in a row. The neural network will simulate how these two different populations perform. Those with fra(X) may have an abundance of neurons in the HD; paradoxically, having too many neurons leads to poor memory and slower learning. These neurons are represented by hidden units in the network model, and an overabundance of hidden units means that the model does not abstract important elements from the environment. The network too much idiosyncratic, moist, and extraneous information and this is infelicitous for sequencing. Proper sequencing relies on the activation and storage of meaningful, well-abstracted neuronal patterns. The specific aims of this grant are 1) to complete the development of a game-like, sequential card playing task that can be used to assess visual working memory in a motivating manner, 2) to compare fra(X) and typical populations' performance on the card task, and 3) to implement a neural network that will provide a neurologically-motivated, more process- oriented account of the working memory differences between the two populations.

"Multi-Site Analysis of Hippocampal Neuronal Ensembles    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hippocampus is a brain structure that is critical for forming and retaining long-term, episodic memories. Damage to the hippocampus from Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, epilepsy, or traumatic brain injury causes a profound amnesic syndrome in which patients are unable to form lasting memories of the everyday events of their lives. Converging evidence from humans and animal models suggests that the hippocampus integrates information from two parallel processing streams, which convey information about spatial location (context) and about individual objects or items, to create conjunctive representations of objects in place (or events in context). This proposal will investigate the organization of the flow of information through these parallel processing streams into the hippocampus, as well as the interaction of these streams with intrahippocampal processing of the CA3 and CA1 regions. Prior work on hippocampal place cells of rats has demonstrated a dissociation between the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 fields in terms of the coherence of ensemble spatial representations when local cues and global landmarks are pitted against each other. CA3 demonstrated a more coherent representation than CA1, in that the place fields tended to be controlled coherently by the local cues, whereas CA1 representations split into local- and global-landmark dominated ensembles. This proposal will test a series of hypotheses regarding the anatomical flow of information into the CA3 and CA1 regions that may account for the different responses of these regions. Multi-electrode techniques will be used to record the activity of neurons in different parts of the CA3 and CA1 regions and their input structures, including the entorhinal cortex and subicular complex (parasubiculum and presubiculum) in freely behaving rats. Local and global cues sets will be altered to test whether different parts of the hippocampal formation are preferentially bound to local or global frames of reference, and whether the known anatomical projections among these areas can account for the differential responses of CA3 and CA1 ensembles to these manipulations. These experiments will generate great insight into the nature of information processing and the organization of information flow into and through the hippocampal system, information that is critical toward understanding the computations performed by the hippocampus in the service of episodic memory. Such fundamental knowledge may be crucial for devising treatment strategies to ameliorate the devastating symptoms of hippocampal amnesia and to target selective sites for potential pharmaceutical or surgical therapies for these disorders. Profound memory loss is a hallmark of such degenerative brain disorders as Alzheimer's Disease, which originates in an area called the entorhinal cortex, progresses into the hippocampus, and eventually progresses throughout the brain's cortical regions.

"DYNAMIC INFORMATION AND MENTAL REPRESENTATION In everyday life people interact with a dynamic environment. We coordinate our movements with the movements of others when we drive, walk on a crowded street, dance with a partner, or engage in just about any interaction with other people.  Even our encounters with the inanimate environment typically result in dynamic events; we move furniture, cook food, type documents. What is the basis of our motor competence in these daily interactions with the world? The proposed research continues to pursue the notion that our competence depends on our ability to anticipate the immediate future, and further that we accomplish this anticipation by virtue of dynamic mental representations (Freyd, 1987) in which time falls inevitably forward from the dynamic present (Freyd, in press-b).  Much of the proposed experimental research is designed to uncover the structure of dynamic representations. For instance, experiments using the phenomenon of representational momentum will probe the temporal nature of mental representation.  In these experiments subjects are asked to remember the final state of an implied transformation; typically their memories are shifted forward.  In related experiments internalized knowledge of physical laws will be investigated. Other experiments will investigate dynamic memory shifts for purely static stimuli, including static art (for which dynamic memory shifts may underlie aesthetic excitement).  The empirical results from these experiments will be used toward developing a theory of mental representation that can account for our perceptual and motor competence.  The theory will be constructed at multiple levels of analysis: the cognitive, neurological, and also the social.  This last level of analysis draws on the concept of shareability (Freyd, 1983c, in press-a).

Given that humans are an extremely intellectually social species, the shareability of information may have profound impact on how we represent the world.  Experiments are proposed to test the hypothesis that dynamic representations are not directly shareable, perhaps not even consciously accessible, and that the representational demands of motor competence are thus at odds with those of communication.  It is hoped that the integrated theory will lead to a new conceptualization of knowledge representation, dynamic information, perception and motor behavior, communication of information, and how these factors interrelate at the neural, cognitive, and social levels.

"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction.

"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction.

"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse.

"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety.

"COMPOSITE HOLOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATIVE RECOGNITION MEMORY The objective of this research program is to develop and test by means of computer simulations, a distributed model of human memory, CHARM (Composite Holographic Associative Recall Model).  This model, which has had considerable success in accounting for the facts of cued and free recall, will be extended to human recognition memory.  The empirical data base for recognition is well elaborated, but our understanding of the underlying processes and mechanisms is inadequate.

"COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH FOR STUDYING THE BRAIN Fundamental to curing a variety of disorders that affect learning and memory is an understanding of how learning and memory occur.  That is, now that we are beginning to understand the cellular and subcellular events that lead to synaptic modification, it is time to ask how such microscopic changes are integrated into, and used by, the functioning nervous system. As our current knowledge stands, it is far from obvious how stored memories of polysensory events that occur in a temporally distributed manner (e.g., I spent yesterday afternoon at the grocery store) can be recalled and used by the brain as a more or less discretely coded event.  It is our long term objective to explain such issues of learning and memory in terms of information processing.  To accomplish this objective the proposed research aims to create a quantitative theory that defines information processing as a function of synaptic modifications, neuronal physiologies, and the neuroanatomies of different brain regions.  The proposed research concentrates on the architectures and cellular physiologies of the hippocampus as they are currently understood or as they might actually be (given the limits of the biological research performed to date).  The problem of accurate prediction, as is required of small animals in a spatial task, focuses our attention on a specific problem.  By arriving at an abstract definition of the prediction problem and by considering certain basic facts of the nervous system in the context of the theory of computational complexity, we develop the issue of preprocessing signals in a neural network reflecting current knowledge of the hippocampus.  This preprocessing for improving prediction is accomplished by recoding process that temporally compresses and statistically simplifies temporally distributed, polysensory signals.  The methods of the research are computer simulations and theorem proving. By virtue of the abstract approach inherent in the use of information theoretic measures, it is possible to study input environments that are no more, or less, than environments defined by their statistics.  The modeled brain networks transform sequences of inputs that are multivariate 0's and 1's into outputs that are also multivariate sequences of 0's and 1's.  The statistics of the output sequences are then analyzed, and the information loss is evaluated.  Additionally, the availability of the recoded information for a neuron-generated prediction is evaluated via a multivariate measure of statistical dependence.  This evaluation is critical because the whole point of transforming signals - i.e., taking the information present in one representation of the input environment and recoding it as another representation of the same input - is to make a representation that is more usable by successive brain regions (minimizing statistical dependence can be very helpful).  The computer simulations are repeated using a Monte Carlo procedure in order to quantify the average behavior of each network studied.  Such results lead to conjectured theorems that, if possible, are rigorous statements concerning the average ability of each network to recode information.

"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown.

"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University.

"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY The misuse of opioids, opioid addiction and overdose are a serious national public health crisis—the opioid epidemic—that despite increased scientific, clinical and government attention, continues to grow. Methadone is a generally effective treatment for opioid use disorder, however relapse rates remain high, and risk of overdose is greatest during relapse. There is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid relapse to improve our understanding of opioid use disorder and its treatment. Using connectome-based methods (i.e., functional connectivity) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recently identified a large-scale brain network that predicted opioid relapse from both resting and task states. Connectome-based methods enable data-driven characterization of whole brain networks related to behavior that might be better suited to describe complex clinical phenomena (e.g., opioid relapse). Building on prior work indicating the utility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to test brain activation patterns related to specific functions and individual abilities to regulate these functions, the proposed project will use connectome-based neurofeedback to target patterns of functional connectivity within our recently identified “opioid abstinence network”. This information is critical to improve understanding of mechanisms of opioid relapse. Individuals on methadone will be randomized to receive either active (n=12) or sham (n=12) connectome-based neurofeedback at 3 weekly scanning sessions including feedback and transfer runs. Additional baseline and follow-up scans will include resting state and reward and cognitive task runs. Craving, negative affect and opioid use will be measured weekly and at 1-mo follow-up. Based on our pilot data, connectome-based feedback will be targeted at the opioid abstinence network and we hypothesize that increased connectivity in this network will be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with reduced opioid use from baseline to follow-up scans (Aim 1a) and at 1-mo follow- up (Aim 1b). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with increased opioid abstinence network connectivity in resting state (Aim 2a) and task (reward, cognitive) state (Aim 2b) versus sham feedback, as in our pilot work. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with greater improvements in clinical features of opioid use disorder (craving, negative affect) than sham feedback (Aim 3a) and that increased opioid abstinence network connectivity will correlate with these improvements (Aim 3b). Overall, this project tests a potentially transformative hypothesis relating large-scale brain network dynamics to outcomes in opioid use disorder, and tests a highly innovative method for real-time fMRI neurofeedback from the opioid abstinence network to improve clinical features of opioid use disorder. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the functional neurobiology of opioid relapse and more generally has the potential to transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project leverages advances in real-time fMRI neurofeedback and machine learning to test whether methadone-treated individuals with opioid use disorder can increase functional connectivity within an empirically-derived “opioid abstinence network” that has previously been identified to predict opioid relapse. This project will provide critical data and information to improve our understanding of opioid relapse and may transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions more generally.

"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models.

"Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function Project Summary Precision and generalization are two fundamental properties of memory function. The former allows individuals to distinguish between similar episodes to reduce interference. The latter allows individuals to link information across episodes and apply past knowledge to new situations. Advanced age is associated with declines in memory function that affect some aspects of memory more than others. Memory specificity, in particular, is known to show substantial age-related decline, whereas the ability to remember the `gist' of past events is typically intact. However, it is unclear if the spared gist memory is related to generalization or simply reflects a lack of specificity. If generalized representations form independently of event-specific representations, older may show intact generalization. Alternatively, if generalization arises from representations of individual events, aging may reduce memory specificity and impair generalization. The proposed research seeks to test the relationship between memory precision and generalization and how that relationship changes with age. Using category learning as a representative domain, three studies will use cognitive modeling of behavioral data, pattern information analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-based fMRI to identify the cognitive and neural bases of memory precision and generalization in young and older adults. Study 1 will test the hypothesis that young but not older adults deploy generalization and precision flexibly depending on the task context. To do so, a category-learning task will be used with training sets that we expect will differ in their demands on representing individual items (i.e., precision) and abstracting to a category prototype (i.e., generalization). Participants will then be tested on memory for individual exemplars presented during training (precision test) and on their ability to classify new exemplars (generalization test). Study 2 will test the hypothesis that older adults have difficulty forming representations of individual items while representations of abstract, prototypical information remain stable with age. FMRI data will be collected while young and older adults complete the training phase of a category-learning task. We will use pattern information analyses (multivariate pattern analysis, representational similarity analysis) and model-based fMRI to track the development of item and category representations over the course of learning in each age group. Study 3 will test the hypothesis that young adults maintain representations of both individual exemplars and category prototypes, and that exemplar representations are used primarily during recognition whereas prototype representations are used primarily during categorization. We propose that older adults will use prototype representations during both categorization and recognition due to difficulties in utilizing exemplar representations. Together, these studies will characterize age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision in order to serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions to aid memory-based cognition.

"Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function Project Summary Precision and generalization are two fundamental properties of memory function. The former allows individuals to distinguish between similar episodes to reduce interference. The latter allows individuals to link information across episodes and apply past knowledge to new situations. Advanced age is associated with declines in memory function that affect some aspects of memory more than others. Memory specificity, in particular, is known to show substantial age-related decline, whereas the ability to remember the `gist' of past events is typically intact. However, it is unclear if the spared gist memory is related to generalization or simply reflects a lack of specificity. If generalized representations form independently of event-specific representations, older may show intact generalization. Alternatively, if generalization arises from representations of individual events, aging may reduce memory specificity and impair generalization. The proposed research seeks to test the relationship between memory precision and generalization and how that relationship changes with age. Using category learning as a representative domain, three studies will use cognitive modeling of behavioral data, pattern information analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-based fMRI to identify the cognitive and neural bases of memory precision and generalization in young and older adults. Study 1 will test the hypothesis that young but not older adults deploy generalization and precision flexibly depending on the task context. To do so, a category-learning task will be used with training sets that we expect will differ in their demands on representing individual items (i.e., precision) and abstracting to a category prototype (i.e., generalization). Participants will then be tested on memory for individual exemplars presented during training (precision test) and on their ability to classify new exemplars (generalization test). Study 2 will test the hypothesis that older adults have difficulty forming representations of individual items while representations of abstract, prototypical information remain stable with age. FMRI data will be collected while young and older adults complete the training phase of a category-learning task. We will use pattern information analyses (multivariate pattern analysis, representational similarity analysis) and model-based fMRI to track the development of item and category representations over the course of learning in each age group. Study 3 will test the hypothesis that young adults maintain representations of both individual exemplars and category prototypes, and that exemplar representations are used primarily during recognition whereas prototype representations are used primarily during categorization. We propose that older adults will use prototype representations during both categorization and recognition due to difficulties in utilizing exemplar representations. Together, these studies will characterize age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision in order to serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions to aid memory-based cognition.

"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue.

"Combining artificial neural network models and fMRI to study brain and language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to supplement the applicant's existing training in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with additional training in artificial neural network (ANN) modeling. In general, ANN models have been used to provide mechanistic accounts of behavior, while fMRI has been used to test for neural activation differences corresponding to differences in task conditions. To date there have been few efforts to combine the two approaches. Successfully doing so will enable an additional level of inference in which, on the one hand, a specific cognitive mechanism can be attributed to a particular brain activation pattern, and on the other hand, neural correlates can be ascribed to dynamic, quantitative models of behavior. Aim 1 is to develop methods for relating network activity and fMRI data. We hypothesize that successfully combining ANN models with fMRI will yield results similar to but not identical with results from more traditional task or stimulus based methods of fMRI analysis. The class of models considered here contains an input layer, an output layer, and at least one hidden layer, in addition to weighted connections between these layers. We will use an aggregate energy term to derive model-related activity associated with each stimulus presented to the model. When concatenated across stimuli, this model-derived signal will be treated as a prediction of the blood oxygen level dependent time course against which the signal in each brain image voxel will be tested. The expected advantage of the combined approach is that it should provide a clear functional interpretation of the fMRI results. Aim 2 is to apply these methods to the study of a few primary phenomena in reading aloud: word frequency effects, spelling-to-sound regularity, as well as sublexical orthographies and phonotactics. We hypothesize that network-derived regressors for these factors will yield more interpretive power than have standard regressors alone. The critical point is that interpretation of results from the combined approach is constrained by specific processing characteristics of the model from which the regressors were derived. Public Health Relevance: We aim to combine the complimentary strengths of fMRI and modeling to gain a deeper understanding of the brain, which will be invaluable in understanding and developing treatments for brain damage.

"Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the  top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent  hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the  activities of daily living. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase  quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a  fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices  require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of  showing caregivers how falls occur.  Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense (also known as SafelyYou), an online fall detection  system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and  related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL will confirm the fall  detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms. We will demonstrate it for 100  patients in 13 memory care facilities. Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for  specific patients; for ex., some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should  be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night. It does not require action of individuals  / caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well-suited for individuals with ADRD.  We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence)  approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will  call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The human can monitor  several facilities at a given time.  This project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 13 memory care facilities,  recruited through our previous (IRB approved) pilot. The work will leverage our previous three  pilots. • Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. • Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility from  the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to  clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from 13 and 11 in the first 2 months to 2 in the  final month, due to video review with care staff. • Pilot 3 (ongoing): We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in  13 facilities of the Carlton, Integral Senior Living, Pacifica and SRG networks, totaling 100  patients already monitored by our system (offline). The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the 100 cameras in these facilities into a  real-time fall detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL support.  Compared to a 3-month baseline from the 100 cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with 150+  participants [8,14]. The proposed NestSense system uses off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to perform detection of  safety-critical events for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia patients in memory care  facilities. It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers (e.g., through wearing  any kind of device). The NestSense technology provides the first robust non-wearable fall detection  tuned specifically to the privacy-security tradeoffs of dementia care. It provides an answer to  today’s technology gaps (far from 100% reliability) by use of a Human-in-the Loop (HIL) paradigm to  enable a quick rollout of the technology. Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of  our system by patients, family, and memory care staff in the Carlton, Integral Senior Living,  Pacifica and SRG networks, we have deployed the system in offline mode in 13 facilities of the  network, monitoring 100 patients. The research, implementation, and deployment work encompassed in  this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof  of concept, operational in real-time mode, with HIL, to reduce fall-related hospitalizations and  time spent on the ground. The pilot follows 3 previous pilots, the most recent of which deploys  cameras with these 100 patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of  occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care. This study will translate those cameras  into a real-time fall (online) detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL  support. Compared to a 3-month baseline from the cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on previous clinical trials with 100+ participants [8,14].",Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias,9465622,R43AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Event', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Managed Care', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scheduling and Staffing', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'falls', 'human-in-the-loop', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'success', 'time use', 'willingness']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R43,2017,150000,-0.037649306100213664
"Brain Activity and Language Comprehension in Psychosis   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Thought disorder is a cardinal symptom of       schizophrenia, and is inferred through abnormal language. The underlying             cognitive abnormality that causes thought disorder is unknown. The broad aim of      this proposal is to understand the neurophysiological basis of thought disorder      in schizophrenia and psychotic mania. We will test a model of semantic               over-activation and verbal Working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia,              contrasted with an executive attention abnormality in mania. We will measure         language comprehension, reaction times, and the activity of the brain via            event-related potentials, and correlate these measures with clinical measures        of symptoms and neuropsychological measures of working memory performance. One       possible dysfunction is an abnormality in semantic memory activation                 (hyperpriming) whereby associated by contextually inappropriate concepts crowd       the mind of schizophrenia patients. Paradoxically, schizophrenia patients            outperform controls on speeded lexical decision tasks, with faster reaction          times. However, at slower speeds, the performance of patients falls off              sharply. The neural substrates of this hyperpriming and of the later drop off        in performance are unknown. We test a two-factor model of schizophrenic thought      disorder with both an initial automatic excitatory abnormality and a later           abnormality in the controlled utilization of context stored in verbal working        memory by having subjects process sentences, word pairs, and word triplets for       semantic relatedness. The stimuli will include homographs as the primary probe       of associative derangement.                                                                                                                                               Homographs are words with multiple meanings, and occupy places in more than one      unrelated semantic network. For example, board may mean plank or committee.          Schizophrenia patients appear to display a semantic bias towards strong              associates and networks such that they tend to select the dominant homograph         meaning (board means plank) even in the face of context that mandates accessing      the subordinate meaning (board means committee). We propose to examine language      processing while varying networks strength (dominant versus subordinate              meanings), while varying associative strength (strongly versus weakly                associated words), in the face of strongly biasing context followed by weak          associates, and in the face of weakly biasing context followed by strong             associates.

"Brain Activity and Language Comprehension in Psychosis   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Thought disorder is a cardinal symptom of       schizophrenia, and is inferred through abnormal language. The underlying             cognitive abnormality that causes thought disorder is unknown. The broad aim of      this proposal is to understand the neurophysiological basis of thought disorder      in schizophrenia and psychotic mania. We will test a model of semantic               over-activation and verbal Working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia,              contrasted with an executive attention abnormality in mania. We will measure         language comprehension, reaction times, and the activity of the brain via            event-related potentials, and correlate these measures with clinical measures        of symptoms and neuropsychological measures of working memory performance. One       possible dysfunction is an abnormality in semantic memory activation                 (hyperpriming) whereby associated by contextually inappropriate concepts crowd       the mind of schizophrenia patients. Paradoxically, schizophrenia patients            outperform controls on speeded lexical decision tasks, with faster reaction          times. However, at slower speeds, the performance of patients falls off              sharply. The neural substrates of this hyperpriming and of the later drop off        in performance are unknown. We test a two-factor model of schizophrenic thought      disorder with both an initial automatic excitatory abnormality and a later           abnormality in the controlled utilization of context stored in verbal working        memory by having subjects process sentences, word pairs, and word triplets for       semantic relatedness. The stimuli will include homographs as the primary probe       of associative derangement.                                                                                                                                               Homographs are words with multiple meanings, and occupy places in more than one      unrelated semantic network. For example, board may mean plank or committee.          Schizophrenia patients appear to display a semantic bias towards strong              associates and networks such that they tend to select the dominant homograph         meaning (board means plank) even in the face of context that mandates accessing      the subordinate meaning (board means committee). We propose to examine language      processing while varying networks strength (dominant versus subordinate              meanings), while varying associative strength (strongly versus weakly                associated words), in the face of strongly biasing context followed by weak          associates, and in the face of weakly biasing context followed by strong             associates.

"BEHAVIORAL AND COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES OF MORPHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  This proposal describes        research on inflectional and derivational morphology and their role in           reading and related tasks.  Morphology is the aspect of language concerning      the forms of words.  The issues to be addressed concern how this information     is represented in lexical memory; how it relates to other types of               information including orthography, phonology, and semantics; and how it is       used in processing.  The research utilizes both behavioral studies of            skilled language users and computer simulation modeling.  The issues are         framed in terms of connectionist principles concerning knowledge                 representation, acquisition, and processing that were developed in previous      research on reading simple, monomorphemic words.  The proposed research          attempts to extend this theoretical framework to the processing of more          complex words.  The main emphasis of the research is on the quasiregular         character of inflectional and derivational morphology:  the fact that both       systems are productive and can be described as ""rule-governed"" but also          admit many exceptions that deviate from what is predicted from the rules.        These phenomena have standardly been treated within dual-route models of         lexical access in which there are separate mechanisms for the rule-governed      cases and exceptions.  Connectionist models provide an alternative approach      in which all forms are governed by a single network.  The experiments focus      on phenomena that differentiate the dual- and single mechanism approaches in     both inflectional and derivational domains.  The theoretical account is also     tested by implementing computational models with the goal of simulating          behavioral data in close detail.                                                                                                                                   n/a",BEHAVIORAL AND COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES OF MORPHOLOGY,6538841,R01MH058723,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' communication behavior', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' human subject', ' language', ' memory', ' neural information processing', ' phonology', ' psychological models', ' reading', ' semantics', ' syntax']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2002,121131,0.03765611548306547

The experiments focus      on phenomena that differentiate the dual- and single mechanism approaches in     both inflectional and derivational domains.  The theoretical account is also     tested by implementing computational models with the goal of simulating          behavioral data in close detail.                                                                                                                                   n/a",BEHAVIORAL AND COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES OF MORPHOLOGY,2678138,R01MH058723,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' communication behavior', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' human subject', ' language', ' memory', ' neural information processing', ' phonology', ' psychological models', ' reading', ' semantics', ' syntax']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,1998,110779,0.03765611548306547
"Memory Representations in Aging Project Summary/Abstract Episodic memory shows a robust decline in aging. Decades of neuroimaging research has yielded a wealth of information on the neural mechanisms of age-related episodic memory decline, but a particular limitation of previous studies is that they focused on memory processes (operations performed on memories) and not memory representations (the content of memories). It is likely that memory representations also decline with age, making the investigation of memory representations essential to providing novel insight into mechanisms underlying age-related episodic memory decline, which is important for the development of interventions for memory rehabilitation. Particularly hindering future intervention development, it is unclear (1) how memory representations are affected by age-related differences in the contributions of perceptual vs. conceptual processes, which change across the lifespan and may be targeted in an intervention, and (2) how the structural basis of memory representations changes across the lifespan, which is necessary to understand for an intervention ameliorating age-related memory representation deficits to have long term effects. Here, the applicant proposes an innovative two-prong approach that examines age-related differences in the influence on memory representations of perceptual vs. conceptual processes and brain structural networks. The proposed project will provide mentored training in (1) the assessment of brain/neurocognitive changes in younger and older adults, (2) advanced MRI analysis (e.g., graph theory, deep convolutional neural networks) and (3) multimodal imaging analysis (functional and structural), which are necessary for utilizing the two-prong approach, and (4) career development. The training plan includes coursework, workshops, one- on-one mentorship, participation in seminars, directed readings, and attendance at national and international conferences. In Study 1, while undergoing fMRI, 36 younger adults and 36 older adults study pictures of complex scenes and later retrieve their memories of the scenes. Participants’ use of perceptual and conceptual processes are experimentally manipulated. The goal is to link age-related memory representational quality deficits to age effects in perceptual vs. conceptual processing (Aim 1). The applicant investigates this aim with representational similarity analyses combined with cutting-edge deep convolutional neural networks. In Study 2, the applicant also collects diffusion weighted images to link age-related memory representation quality deficits to age effects on structural brain networks (Aim 2). The applicant investigates this aim with novel graph theory and multimodal imaging (functional and structural) analyses. This investigation using a two- prong approach will provide a novel viewpoint on mechanisms underlying age-related episodic memory decline, which is essential for intervention development. Furthermore, at the culmination of this fellowship, the applicant will have a specialized skill set and be well prepared to begin the next phase of training. Project Narrative Episodic memory (the memory for specific past events) exhibits a robust decline with age, and episodic memory deficits are one of the first symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Over the past few decades, the field has identified several neural mechanisms underlying age-related episodic memory decline, but there is still much unknown about the mechanisms. To provide novel insight on mechanisms underlying age-related episodic memory decline, the proposed research use an innovate two-prong approach, which examines age-related differences in the influence on memory representations of perceptual vs. conceptual processes and brain structural networks; this investigation is necessary (1) for novel intervention development designed to ameliorate memory deficiencies in older adults and (2) to provide the foundations for future work using the two-prong approach to investigate mechanisms underlying pathological aging.",Memory Representations in Aging,9762552,F31AG060691,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Concept Formation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive training', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'evidence base', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'operation', 'pathological aging', 'preservation', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,37778,0.08625261920097833
"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences). By pursuing these aims, the proposed research will          provide a more complete understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                n/a",CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS,6639162,R01MH061316,"['artificial intelligence', ' autogenic training', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' discrimination learning', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' memory', ' neocortex', ' neural information processing', ' neurophysiology', ' psychological reinforcement', ' startle reaction']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,2003,181110,0.04686425824527615

The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6392795,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2001,123541,0.023433978846874107

"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Basal ganglia and dopamine contributions to feedback-based learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad aim of this proposal is to understand the cognitive and neural systems that support incremental, feedback-based learning. Recent evidence suggests that this type of learning depends on the basal ganglia (BG) - primarily the striatum and its dopaminergic afferents. By contrast, a distinct and independent memory system in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is thought to support rapidly formed memories of single-trial episodes. However, recent studies have shown that this dichotomy may be oversimplified, and that in many cases the BG and the MTL both contribute to learning. Thus, fundamental questions remain regarding the circumstances under which each of these systems support learning and the implications of their involvement for the representation of knowledge. Bridging across electrophysiological data, computational modeling, and human neuropsychology, the proposed research aims to test the hypothesis that a critical factor driving learning to depend on one system or the other is the timing of response-contingent feedback. The studies herein seek to test this hypothesis by systematically investigating how the timing of feedback (immediate vs. delayed) modulates different aspects of learning and memory. Our model system is healthy older adults and individuals with Parkinson's disease, who suffer from disrupted BG function but have intact MTL function. We will further examine both chronic and acute dopamine perturbations by examining how dopaminergic medication modulates feedback-based learning in Parkinson's patients. Finally, we aim to determine the cognitive mechanisms involved under different delay conditions, comparing incremental and episodic learning. The resulting findings are expected to enhance our understanding of the cognitive and neural systems supporting feedback-based learning, and how these are modulated by BG dysfunction and dopaminergic mechanisms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson's disease is characterized by a range of learning deficits. The resulting findings will provide insight into the nature, and possible cause, of these deficits, as well as how they are impacted by medication.

"Basal ganglia and dopamine contributions to feedback-based learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad aim of this proposal is to understand the cognitive and neural systems that support incremental, feedback-based learning. Recent evidence suggests that this type of learning depends on the basal ganglia (BG) - primarily the striatum and its dopaminergic afferents. By contrast, a distinct and independent memory system in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is thought to support rapidly formed memories of single-trial episodes. However, recent studies have shown that this dichotomy may be oversimplified, and that in many cases the BG and the MTL both contribute to learning. Thus, fundamental questions remain regarding the circumstances under which each of these systems support learning and the implications of their involvement for the representation of knowledge. Bridging across electrophysiological data, computational modeling, and human neuropsychology, the proposed research aims to test the hypothesis that a critical factor driving learning to depend on one system or the other is the timing of response-contingent feedback. The studies herein seek to test this hypothesis by systematically investigating how the timing of feedback (immediate vs. delayed) modulates different aspects of learning and memory. Our model system is healthy older adults and individuals with Parkinson's disease, who suffer from disrupted BG function but have intact MTL function. We will further examine both chronic and acute dopamine perturbations by examining how dopaminergic medication modulates feedback-based learning in Parkinson's patients. Finally, we aim to determine the cognitive mechanisms involved under different delay conditions, comparing incremental and episodic learning. The resulting findings are expected to enhance our understanding of the cognitive and neural systems supporting feedback-based learning, and how these are modulated by BG dysfunction and dopaminergic mechanisms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson's disease is characterized by a range of learning deficits.

"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,9973904,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,645926,-0.1267950280738956
"Investigating Cognitive and Neural Bases of Working Memory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory refers to the retention of information in conscious awareness when this information is not present in the environment, to its manipulation, and to its use in guiding behavior. Working memory has been implicated as a critical contributor to such essential cognitive functions and properties as language comprehension, learning, planning, reasoning, and general fluid intelligence. Additionally, individual differences in working memory performance predict a remarkable array of ""real world"" outcome measures, from reading ability to standardized test performance to socioeconomic status to personality traits. Thus, understanding the cognitive and neural bases of working memory functions is central to understanding normal cognition, as well as its neurological and psychiatric dysfunctions. The PI's research program investigates the cognitive and neural bases of working memory function. It does so within a framework that holds that working memory is an emergent property that arises from the coordinated recruitment, via attention, of brain systems that have evolved to accomplish sensory-, representation-, or action-related functions. The Specific Aims of the present application for renewal of the PI's R01 build on this work by articulating hypotheses than will support stronger inference than could those proposed in 2003 (due to the addition of novel multivariate methods for measuring functional connectivity and of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the PI's methodological armamentarium), and by testing mechanistic hypotheses that have arisen from the PI's recent work. They are: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that working memory storage is supported by broadly distributed, functionally connected networks of regions posterior to the PFC.

The Specific Aims of the present application for renewal of the PI's R01 build on this work by articulating hypotheses than will support stronger inference than could those proposed in 2003 (due to the addition of novel multivariate methods for measuring functional connectivity and of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the PI's methodological armamentarium), and by testing mechanistic hypotheses that have arisen from the PI's recent work. They are: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that working memory storage is supported by broadly distributed, functionally connected networks of regions posterior to the PFC. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that working memory storage is accomplished, in part, via the temporary activation of long-term memory (LTM) representations. Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that the frontal eye fields (FEF) are a source of the attentional activation that supports working memory storage. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Impairments of working memory are seen in many neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders. Achieving a better understanding of the cognitive and neurobiological organization of working memory functions, therefore, may have important implications for the diagnosis, clinical treatment, and cognitive rehabilitation of patients with these disorders.

"Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from Dr. Lorenzo Pasquini, a postdoctoral scholar in clinical neuroimaging at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlying socioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background in neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research and high-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training and research program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms among elderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiological recordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grant applications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor, Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomic and socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, a computational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy and psychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning. This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic system and the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neural systems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiology underlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brain network organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1). Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assess the neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize on multimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy older controls to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior (Exploratory Aim 3). The proposed training will allow Dr. Pasquini to develop a scientific niche and conduct his research with world-class mentorship, paving the way for his career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neurobiological basis of socioemotional symptoms, a debilitating feature of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, is not well understood. The brain and autonomic nervous system cohesively interact to support socioemotional well-being, and cutting-edge analytical techniques can now reveal the rich dynamic properties of these systems. By leveraging behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease of socioemotional deficits that targets these systems, the goal of the proposed project is to determine how autonomic and functional brain network dynamics shape human emotions and social behavior in healthy and clinical populations.",Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function,10055555,K99AG065457,"['Affective Symptoms', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'career', 'cohesion', 'dynamic system', 'fundamental research', 'geriatric neuropsychiatry', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2020,125010,0.022870128633293598
"Neural Network Models of Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is characterized by alterations of language and inferential processes. In spite of extensive research, core mechanisms of these disturbances remain uncertain. The overall objective of this RO1 proposal is to use DISCERN, a neural network simulation of natural language processing (Miikkulainen & Dyer 1991; Miikkulainen 1993, 1998), to investigate the mechanism(s) of language-based disturbances in schizophrenia. DISCERN learns stories, utilizes inferential processes, replies to questions, and produces coherent, multi-sentence narrative paraphrases of episodic memories. To enhance applicability of DISCERN as a model of human narrative language production, a larger corpus of stories will be learned that incorporates emotion-coding and self-reference. Simulations will be conducted to determine if disrupted function in different neural modules of DISCERN can produce three core language-based illness manifestations of schizophrenia -- (I) positive thought disorder (such as derailment and illogicality), (II) negative thought disorder (reduced language outputs), and (III) delusions of the idee fixe type. DISCERN will be used to compare and contrast effects of excessive noise versus reduced network connectivity when applied to semantic and working memory modules. Both types of ""lesions"" have been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Noise-induced lesions are predicted to produce word selection errors and curtail language output -- but not to produce positive thought disorder or delusions. In contrast, connectivity loss, when applied to story processing modules, is predicted to simulate all three disturbances, i.e., derailment and curtailment of language outputs as well as production of ""fixed"" narratives that simulate delusions. A parallel, pilot study of normal subjects and patients with schizophrenia will assess narrative recall of episodic memory. These behavioral data will be used to test and refine models of normal and schizophrenic language production. These findings will significantly advance our understanding of illness mechanisms in schizophrenia and direct future research aimed at developing more selective treatments that reverse these abnormalities. n/a",Neural Network Models of Language,6902613,R01MH066228,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'computational neuroscience', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human subject', 'language', 'neural information processing', 'neuropsychology', 'psychopathology', 'schizophrenia', 'short term memory', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,220725,0.0943675884827925

"Classifying Schizophrenia:Leukocyte Multigene Signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is designed to produce data for development of a biological classification of schizophrenic patients, based on high-density microarray measurement of transcribed white blood cell (leukocyte) RNA. In a recently completed NIMH B-start grant, the PI has utilized global gene expression analysis of peripheral leukocytes as a classification medium for schizophrenia. The preliminary study results were striking; hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data from seven schizophrenic patients and five controls, resulted in classification of all the samples into their correct group (schizophrenic patients or healthy controls). This exciting result has led to the present proposal with the following Specific Aims: (1) a. To collect peripheral blood leukocytes from twenty neuroleptic-naive schizophrenics, twelve neuroleptic-treated schizophrenics, and fourteen healthy control subjects over the two-year period of the project, and b. To employ Affymetrix GeneChip mieroarray technology to measure global gene expression in the leukocyte samples. (2) The leukocyte gene expression datasets collected during the preliminary study and the proposal, resulting in a final analysis of 58 subjects, will be combined and analyzed by hierarchical clustering and discriminate analyses to identify and validate multi-gene fingerprints that differentiate schizophrenic subjects from healthy controls. The current proposed study, which incorporates the collection of samples from neurolepfic-naive schizophrenic patients, is designed to avoid the potential confounding factor of neuroleptic-medication induced gene expression changes. We are optimistic that completion of this proposed exploratory study will lead to the creation of a multigene expression signature that can classify leukocyte samples into schizophrenic patient or control groups and that can be used to predict the class of unknown samples. If the validity of our approach is demonstrated in this exploratory study, our longer-term aims for this research are to increase the scope of this work by: 1. Increasing the number of subjects in our schizophrenic dataset to the level of acceptable statistical power and also duplicating this dataset for other psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder and major depression. This will allow us to test these classification signatures and thus attempt biological diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and possible biological subtypes of those disorders. These biological signatures may, in turn, stimulate the development of targeted novel medications.  2. Perform a follow-up study recruiting families with members at increased risk of developing schizophrenia. These families will allow us to test whether gene expression patterns that classify schizophrenia are present in premorbid subjects and whether it is possible to predict risk of illness, and thus provide early treatment that might mitigate the course of the disorder. The public health benefits of a biological classification of schizophrenia are potentially large, especially if predictive testing in the premorbid stage is possible, raising the possibility of targeted preventative treatment.         n/a",Classifying Schizophrenia:Leukocyte Multigene Signatures,6750683,R21MH066883,"['antipsychotic agents', 'bipolar depression', 'clinical research', 'complementary DNA', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'family genetics', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'leukocytes', 'major depression', 'messenger RNA', 'microarray technology', 'mood disorders', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'schizophrenia']",NIMH,NATHAN S.

"Auditory-verbal functional studies of schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess early auditory processing, verbal semantic processing, and their association with positive symptoms in first episode (FE), chronic schizophrenic (CSZ), and matched control subjects (CN). These studies are aimed at understanding the link between brain dysfunction and symptoms, thus facilitating the discovery of preventative measures and treatments. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) plays a major role in auditory speech perception and language processing. This region is consistently reported to show volume reductions in MRI studies of schizophrenic subjects (SZ). These volume reductions have been linked to auditory hallucinations, thought disorder, and auditory event-related potential (ERP) abnormalities. Left STG abnormalities are also consistently shown in functional imaging studies of active hallucination or of auditory-verbal processing in SZ. Abnormal fMRI activity in the STG in chronic SZ was found using mismatch negativity (MMN) stimuli that were similar to those used in an ERP paradigm. Recent discoveries have documented structural and functional evidence for the basis of language lateralization in normal individuals. We will use these recent discoveries, in a rapid acoustic processing task (RAP), in addition to the MMN task, as a basis for proposed studies examining early auditory processing in SZ. Lateral temporal (middle, inferior) and temporal-parietal regions are thought to play a role in semantic processing. These regions have also shown abnormalities in functional imaging and ERP studies of schizophrenia that use language. Semantic priming has been shown (although not consistently) in a number of studies to be abnormal in SZ. A recent behavioral study used words that differed in terms of the properties of their semantic networks. The reduced performance of SZ subjects on the cued recall of words was attributed to the effects of abnormal connectivity in the semantic network but not network size. SZ and CN subjects will be tested in an fMRI study of auditory/verbal semantic priming. This study will examine the brain activity related to the spreading activation between semantic associates. Words will vary in the degree of connectivity, and hence the degree of spreading activation between their associates. A recently completed preliminary study of CN subjects used this semantic priming task (SP) and found that as predicted, different patterns of brain activity in temporal lobe regions were associated with different semantic properties (connectivity and relatedness) of the word pairs.         n/a",Auditory-verbal functional studies of schizophrenia,7335590,R01MH067080,"['Acoustics', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Hallucination', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Condition', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Hallucinations', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Score', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wages', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'cost', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'millisecond', 'myelination', 'processing speed', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'semantic processing', 'size', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'stimulus processing']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2008,275210,0.04207120575737861

These studies are aimed at understanding the link between brain dysfunction and symptoms, thus facilitating the discovery of preventative measures and treatments. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) plays a major role in auditory speech perception and language processing. This region is consistently reported to show volume reductions in MRI studies of schizophrenic subjects (SZ). These volume reductions have been linked to auditory hallucinations, thought disorder, and auditory event-related potential (ERP) abnormalities. Left STG abnormalities are also consistently shown in functional imaging studies of active hallucination or of auditory-verbal processing in SZ. Abnormal fMRI activity in the STG in chronic SZ was found using mismatch negativity (MMN) stimuli that were similar to those used in an ERP paradigm. Recent discoveries have documented structural and functional evidence for the basis of language lateralization in normal individuals. We will use these recent discoveries, in a rapid acoustic processing task (RAP), in addition to the MMN task, as a basis for proposed studies examining early auditory processing in SZ. Lateral temporal (middle, inferior) and temporal-parietal regions are thought to play a role in semantic processing. These regions have also shown abnormalities in functional imaging and ERP studies of schizophrenia that use language. Semantic priming has been shown (although not consistently) in a number of studies to be abnormal in SZ. A recent behavioral study used words that differed in terms of the properties of their semantic networks. The reduced performance of SZ subjects on the cued recall of words was attributed to the effects of abnormal connectivity in the semantic network but not network size. SZ and CN subjects will be tested in an fMRI study of auditory/verbal semantic priming. This study will examine the brain activity related to the spreading activation between semantic associates. Words will vary in the degree of connectivity, and hence the degree of spreading activation between their associates.

"New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available methods of analysis for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging offer a wealth of possibilities to researchers using this neuroimaging modality. However, these tools suffer from the inherent low signal to noise ratio of the data, and from the limitations of widely used model-based approaches. These problems have been addressed by the community and the literature now describes numerous methods that can remove part of the noise and extract brain activity pattern in a data-driven fashion. This project focuses on the design of optimized algorithms for the estimation and removal of the noise, on the understanding of the applicability of existing data-driven approaches, and on the development of new blind source separation methods for fMRI data. Particular attention will be given to quantification of the gains provided by the newly proposed methods by working on simulated datasets and specifically designed fMRI experiments. The first specific aim is to use a spatio-temporal four-dimensional multiresolution analysis to define an ""'ideal denoising"" scheme for a given study.

"Intracranial EEG for Neuronal Oscillatory Contingency during Cognitive Tasks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain computer interfaces (BCI) involving motor and sensory systems have been successful in restoring function and in improving the lives of patients with neurological diseases. These devices, ranging from deep brain stimulators for Parkinson's disease to more involved devices capable of recapitulating motor function, are becoming increasingly available with recent technological advances and with a greater understanding of underlying neural circuitry. A major area not addressed by these devices is that of higher cognitive functions, such as memory and executive planning. Here, we propose to use intracranial electrocorticographic signals, captured from subdural and depth electrodes implanted in patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy, to extend the role of BCIs to the cognitive domain. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the patterns of neuronal activity that underlie memory storage and recall can be used to adjust stimulus presentation in a cognitive task to augment learning. We propose to develop a BCI that measures and analyzes intracranial neural activity in real time as patients engage in a free recall task, a standard method of measuring one's ability to encode and retrieve episodic memories. Using machine-learning algorithms, we will identify the precise spatiotemporal patterns of electrophysiological brain activity that lead to optimal memory formation. We will compute these patterns separately for each patient. Our system will thus adapt to each individual's brain activity. To close the functional loop between the patient's brain and our system, we will take advantage of these naturally occurring optimal spatiotemporal patterns for memory formation and trigger stimulus presentation on their presence. Animal studies have shown that by presenting stimuli contingent on the oscillatory state of the hippocampus, learning rates can be improved. We hope to demonstrate that conditioning stimulus presentation on the presence of these optimal spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity will improve both memory storage and recall in our patients as well. Such a demonstration will establish a causative, rather than correlational, relationship between these patterns of activity and memory encoding. Furthermore, our research will extend the domain of BCIs to the realm of cognition and memory, and lay the groundwork for a range of BCI systems that can enhance a wide variety of human cognitive functions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are machines that directly interface with the brain by measuring and analyzing neural activity in real time.

"Psychiatric Illness: Multigene Expression Classification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is designed to produce data for the development of a biological classification of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, based on high density microarray measurements of transcribed white blood cell (leukocyte) mRNA. The rationale behind this proposal is based on two sources of data; 1) reports in the literature that document differential expression of immune system response mediators among patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and 2) preliminary results obtained as part of a recently completed NIMH B-start grant. In the preliminary experiments, the PI utilized global gene expression analysis of peripheral leukocytes as a classification medium for schizophrenia. The study results were striking; unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data from eight schizophrenic patients and five control subjects, resulted in classification of all the samples into their correct group (schizophrenic patients or healthy controls). In addition, and of significance to this current proposal, hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data from the schizophrenic patients and from two bipolar disorder patients, resulted in the bipolar disorder patients grouping into a single, discrete subnode from the schizophrenics.  Based on this exciting result, the present proposal has been developed with the following specific aims: la) To collect peripheral blood leukocytes from 25 men with bipolar disorder and 25 men with schizophrenia, over the two year period of this project, lb) To measure global gene expression in the leukocyte samples, using Affymetrix GeneChip microarray technology, and 2) To employ the leukocyte gene expression dataset obtained under Specific Aim 1 of the proposal, in hierarchical clustering and supervised learning algorithms to identify and validate multi-gene expression signatures that distinguish between the subjects by diagnostic group. The current proposed study, which involves the collection of leukocyte samples from patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, has been designed to extend our positive findings from the preliminary investigation of schizophrenics. We are optimistic that the completion of this proposed exploratory study will lead to the creation of multigene expression signatures that can classify leukocyte samples into bipolar disorder or schizophrenic patient groups, and which can be employed to predict the classes of unknown samples. If the validity of our approach is demonstrated in this exploratory R21 study, our longer-term aims for this research are to increase the scope of this work by: 1) increasing the number of subjects in our datasets to the level of acceptable statistical power, 2) investigating the feasibility of a biological signature for diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and to extend this investigation to include other psychiatric disorders such as major depression, and 3) investigating correlations between patient responses to treatment regimes and biological expression signatures. These biological signatures may, in turn, stimulate the development of targeted novel medications. Finally, it may be possible to perform additional follow-up studies, recruiting families with members at increased risk of developing bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, which would allow us to test whether gene expression patterns that classify the disorders are present in premorbid subjects and whether it is possible to predict risk of illness. The public health benefits of a biological classification of psychiatric disorders are potentially large, especially if predictive testing in the premorbid stage is possible, raising the possibility of targeted preventative interventions. n/a",Psychiatric Illness: Multigene Expression Classification,6838721,R21MH067941,"['bipolar depression', 'blood cell count', 'blood chemistry', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder classification', 'drug detection', 'gene expression', 'human genetic material tag', 'human subject', 'leukocytes', 'male', 'messenger RNA', 'microarray technology', 'schizophrenia', 'thyroid function']",NIMH,NATHAN S.

"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration).

"Uncovering complex expression patterns in schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My objective is to acquire advanced and working knowledge of disciplines that will help place the microarray-obtained gene expression data into a broader biological context. For a scientist interested in genomics, ideal expertise encompasses multiple neuroscience disciplines, including (but not limited to) population genetics, biostatistics and stereological assessment of the studied tissue. This additional expertise will enable me to identify complex relationships between datasets, interpret the obtained microarray data in the light of existing linkage studies, perform limited genotyping experiments on our postmortem samples and verify the uncovered gene expression changes using non-biased, stereological sampling methods.   Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia has been associated with deficits of working memory, while functional changes in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) have been related to psychosis.  Furthermore, the presentation of schizophrenia across genders has been associated with differences in age of onset, symptomathology, premorbid history, neuroimaging findings, drug responsiveness and brain structure.   This application is focused around two critical questions: 1) Is there a schizophrenia-related expression profile within and across different brain regions and 2) Are schizophrenia-related expression changes different across genders? In this context, we propose to test seven specific hypotheses using 3 specific aims: Aim1 Compare gene expression pattern in 12 MALE subjects with schizophrenia and matched controls across the prefrontal (PFC) and superior temporal (STG) cortices. Aim 2. Compare gene expression pattern in 12 FEMALE subjects with schizophrenia and matched controls across the prefrontal (PFC) and superior temporal (STG) cortices. Aims 1 and 2 will share the same methodology, and compare the transcriptomes: A) Using whole genome HG_U133A and B Affymetrix microarrays. B) Using custom-made, high-sensitivity polymer eDNA microarrays.  These eDNA polymer arrays, involving our proprietary probes (patent application in progress) will allow us an improved and targeted assessment of many transcripts that are too sparse to be detected by the currently available microarrays. Aim 3.

"Spatiotemporal imaging of language in schizophrenia A disorder of thought and language has long been considered a core feature of schizophrenia. The broad objective of this proposal is to identify abnormalities in the neural dynamics of language processing in schizophrenia using multimodal imaging techniques. It is hypothesized that abnormally increased neural/synaptic activity within a temporal-prefrontal network (left superior and middle temporal, bilateral inferior temporal and left inferior prefrontal cortices) to semantic relationships between individual words leads to abnormal modulation of temporal-prefrontal activity as context is built up, word by word, within and across sentences. This cognitive neurobiological theory of language dysfunction in schizophrenia will be tested in a series of experiments studying (a) semantic relationships between word pairs, (b) the build up of context within sentences and (c) contextual integration across sentences (discourse). In order to investigate ""when"" and ""where"", a multimodal approach will be taken, integrating the advantages of two complementary neuroimaging techniques. First, electrophysiological experiments will determine the time course of neurocognitive abnormalities during language processing in schizophrenia by examining the N400 and late positive components - event related potentials that are known to be sensitive to contextual integration. Second, event-related functional (magnetic resonance imaging studies will characterize the functional neuroanatomy of language abnormalities in schizophrenia by examining the extent, magnitude and temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response within the temporal-prefrontal semantic network.

"Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal has been developed in response to PAR-02-062 (Building Translational Research in Behavioral Science). The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that an explicitly translational, multidisciplinary approach to defining the role of dopamine (DA) in schizophrenia (SC), is capable of illuminating some of the most poorly understood, most treatment-resistant cognitive and motivational aspects of the illness. Specifically, recent basic research has shown that DA cell firing plays a critical role in the encoding of reward prediction and reward based learning. The proposed work will provide a rigorous test of the applicability of this hypothesis as a framework for understanding the motivational and learning impairments of SC with important implications for schizophrenia therapeutics. To test this hypothesis, we have organized a group of basic and clinical investigators into three scientific modules:1) electrophysiology, 2) neuroimaging, and 3) behavior, with the overall program designed to address different aspects of same theory of DA function. These modules are designed to develop collaborative partnerships with the results of initial pilot experiments used to refine hypothesis for further experimental testing. Initial studies are proposed to document the specific behavioral, electrophysiological, and fMRI Bold signal abnormalities of SC patients during the performance of reward learning paradigms, the impact of different antipsychotics on reward processing in animals, and the physiological sequela associated with reward-driven changes in DA cell firing. Computational modeling will be used to determine whether the experimental results in animals and observed deficits in patients are consistent with the hypothesized role of DA in reward processing. The overall program is designed to develop resources, paradigms, and proof of principle studies that illuminate the nature of DA dysfunction in SC through the application of translational paradigms and models demonstrating the critical role of DA in reward and reinforcement learning. If successful, the proposed work is designed to establish the conceptual foundation and preliminary data needed to support individual RO1 applications and a Translational Center.         n/a",Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia,7278791,R24MH072647,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Habenula', 'Haloperidol', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'heuristics', 'human study', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'olanzapine', 'programs', 'quetiapine', 'research study', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'theories', 'translational approach', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2007,342842,0.053591564137548335
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,9107487,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,230351,0.01814416496977212

"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.

We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7692174,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2009,318428,0.03324602307840363

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists.

"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7325760,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2008,65055,0.008987608942559885

"Improved Methods for Single Subject FMRI Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illness is a great burden for the affected individual and economically costly for society. The annual cost of mental disorders has been estimated to be $150 billion, increasing every year, and this total does not include more than three million people receiving disability benefits due to mental disorders. It is imperative that we prioritize research efforts focused on understanding brain function in order to improve diagnostic strategies and discover more effective therapies. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool to visualize and measure typical and atypical cognitive processing. However, many important cognitive processing systems, such as those associated with memory, language, emotion and executive control, only produce small BOLD signals and thus measurements are noisy and have low statistical confidence. Hence, fMRI has not been readily adopted for clinical diagnosis of individual patients. I propose to develop greatly improved methods to suppress the noise sources in fMRI data in order to transform fMRI from a research tool about populations to a consistent and accurate diagnostic tool to study individual cognitive functions. Using the strategy that every noise suppression algorithm must perform well to reliably detect single trial fMRI BOLD signals, I developed visualization methods to ""see"" deeply into fMRI data to evaluate the quality of the data at every step of fMRI data processing. The preliminary studies indicate that there are clear opportunities to improve fMRI image analysis techniques. The proposed research will first develop and test methods to improve suppression of errors from motion and physiological fluctuations. Then it will translate this research by combining these techniques with pattern recognition to characterize individual cognitive activation patterns in typical and atypical populations. My quantitative science expertise is in image processing, algorithm design, and pattern recognition. The research directly supports my interdisciplinary career development with hands-on experience in experiment planning, fMRI scanner operation, neuroscience coursework, and new software methods for application to severely brain disordered populations. In particular, the subjects for this research will include important clinical psychiatric populations with disorders such as fragile X syndrome, Turner syndrome, autism, Williams syndrome, depression, and bipolar disorder, so that all newly developed methods can be immediately put into practice.           n/a",Improved Methods for Single Subject FMRI Analysis,7075928,K25MH077309,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'body movement', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'cognition', 'cognition disorders', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'developmental disease /disorder', 'dyslexia', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'learning disorders', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'mental retardation', 'patient oriented research']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2006,162340,0.042985451714492966
"Testing a Model of Competitive Memory Retrieval    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retrieval-induced forgetting is the forgetting of memories as a result of retrieving other, similar memories. Although retrieval-induced forgetting has been well characterized behaviorally, its neural mechanism is poorly understood. The proposed research uses electrophysiology in humans to monitor the brain activity that correlates with retrieval-induced forgetting. Pattern classification methods will be used to track the activation of memories during retrieval. The pattern of memory activation that leads to forgetting will be extracted using a subsequent forgetting analysis. Neural network simulations of retrieval-induced forgetting predict a specific pattern of memory activation relative to theta band oscillations. These predictions will be tested through examination of how the activation of the to-be-forgotten memories depends on theta phase. The proposed research will also refine the neural network model of retrieval-induced forgetting, by applying it to a hippocampal architecture, and by using more realistic forms of inhibition. Understanding the precise neural mechanisms that govern retrieval-induced forgetting will help us to gain better control over when forgetting occurs, which - in turn - should help us devise better treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (where more forgetting is desirable) and age-related memory disorders (where less forgetting is desirable).           n/a",Testing a Model of Competitive Memory Retrieval,7113431,F31MH077469,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'brain electrical activity', 'clinical research', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'electroencephalography', 'electrophysiology', 'hippocampus', 'human subject', 'long term memory', 'memory', 'memory disorders', 'neural information processing', 'neuropsychology', 'performance', 'predoctoral investigator', 'semantics', 'visual perception', 'vocabulary']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2006,44657,0.09882600966236672
"Statistical learning, memory systems, and sleep-based memory consolidation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The acquisition of language is essential for normal functioning, and problems with language acquisition can severely limit an individual's educational, career, and social opportunities. One mechanism thought to play a critical role in language acquisition is statistical learning, which refers to the process of extracting subtle patterns from environmental input. Although it is commonly assumed that statistical learning operates implicitly, without requiring conscious effort or awareness, this fundamental assumption has not been directly tested. It is possible that inducing statistical learning to occur explicitly rather than implicitly may engage additional explicit memory systems and may also facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation processes that are critical for long-term retention. The goal of the proposed research is to assess whether and how learning mode alters the memory systems and sleep-dependent consolidation processes that support statistical learning.  In the first proposed study, the effect of learning mode on the memory systems recruited for statistical learning will be evaluated, using a combination of behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses. In the second proposed study, the effect of learning mode on sleep-dependent consolidation of statistical representations will be assessed, using a combination of behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. Because patients often show dissociations of implicit and explicit memory, understanding how learning mode may modulate the memory systems and subsequent sleep-dependent consolidation processes that underlie statistical learning could have tremendous potential to inform treatments for language disorders. For example, by manipulating learning mode, therapies may be developed to selectively target one memory system in order to compensate for dysfunctions in the other, or to promote sleep-dependent consolidation.  The proposed fellowship training will provide instruction in two main methodological areas: (1) sleep neurobiology and (2) fMRI analyses. Training in these two different areas will be integrated by the common goal of understanding how learning mode alters the memory systems and consolidation processes that support statistical learning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Difficulties with language acquisition are characteristic of a wide range of disorders, such as specific language impairment and autism, and present a major barrier to normal functioning. Statistical learning, the process of extracting complex patterns from the environment, is thought to play a critical role in language acquisition, with deficits in statistical learning potentially contributing to language-related disorders. The current proposal aims to understand how learning mode influences the memory and consolidation processes that underlie statistical learning and may ultimately inform treatments for those with language-related disorders.                ","Statistical learning, memory systems, and sleep-based memory consolidation",8979446,F32HD078223,"['Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crude Extracts', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Familiarity', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Napping', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'density', 'implicit memory', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'operation', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'specific language impairment']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,54194,0.06694569946796664
"The Developmental Antecedents and Cognitive Correlates of Script-like Attachment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individual differences in adult attachment have significant clinical and societal implications. For example, adult attachment-related variation is associated with (a) higher quality peer relationships, (b) more effective conflict resolution with romantic partners, and (c) more sensitive and responsive parenting. The goal of this proposal is to examine the antecedents of adult attachment in early caregiving experiences. Recent theoretical arguments suggest that high quality and supportive parenting develops into a script-like representation of the attachment relationship, and that these script-like representations of attachment come to influence behavior in adulthood. However, several issues remain unaddressed. Specifically, there has been no large sample empirical demonstration that script-like attachment representations develop from early experience or that these scripts- like attachment representations are associated with more established measures of adult attachment like the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), an indirect assessment of adult attachment representations. We propose to address these gaps in two ways: (1) by examining the developmental antecedents of script-like attachment representations and whether secure base script knowledge accounts for associations between early experience and the AAI and (2) exploring several potential cognitive correlates of script-like attachment representations relevant to AAI performance, specifically memory accessibility and organization. The first aim (SA1) is to examine the developmental antecedents of script-like attachment representations by taking advantage of a large prospective, longitudinal sample, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), which followed 857 participants from infancy to late adolescence. Script-like attachment representations will be assessed by re-coding existing data with a newly developed coding scheme. We will then examine the developmental antecedents of script-like attachment representation with measures of the quality of early experience (e.g. parental sensitivity) collected across development, exploring in particular whether variation in secure base script knowledge mediates associations between early caregiving experiences and adults states of mind regarding attachment as assessed by the AAI. A second set of studies (SA2) will seek to explore the cognitive correlates of script-like attachment representations.

"The Developmental Antecedents and Cognitive Correlates of Script-like Attachment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individual differences in adult attachment have significant clinical and societal implications. For example, adult attachment-related variation is associated with (a) higher quality peer relationships, (b) more effective conflict resolution with romantic partners, and (c) more sensitive and responsive parenting. The goal of this proposal is to examine the antecedents of adult attachment in early caregiving experiences. Recent theoretical arguments suggest that high quality and supportive parenting develops into a script-like representation of the attachment relationship, and that these script-like representations of attachment come to influence behavior in adulthood. However, several issues remain unaddressed. Specifically, there has been no large sample empirical demonstration that script-like attachment representations develop from early experience or that these scripts- like attachment representations are associated with more established measures of adult attachment like the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), an indirect assessment of adult attachment representations. We propose to address these gaps in two ways: (1) by examining the developmental antecedents of script-like attachment representations and whether secure base script knowledge accounts for associations between early experience and the AAI and (2) exploring several potential cognitive correlates of script-like attachment representations relevant to AAI performance, specifically memory accessibility and organization. The first aim (SA1) is to examine the developmental antecedents of script-like attachment representations by taking advantage of a large prospective, longitudinal sample, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), which followed 857 participants from infancy to late adolescence. Script-like attachment representations will be assessed by re-coding existing data with a newly developed coding scheme. We will then examine the developmental antecedents of script-like attachment representation with measures of the quality of early experience (e.g. parental sensitivity) collected across development, exploring in particular whether variation in secure base script knowledge mediates associations between early caregiving experiences and adults states of mind regarding attachment as assessed by the AAI.

"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,9116243,F32HD080306,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'conflict resolution', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'memory process', 'mind control', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'stimulus processing', 'syntax']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2016,60210,0.09023528004402084

"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures.

"Neurobiological Mechanisms Subserving Episodic and Incremental Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal aims to examine the neurobiological mechanisms that subserve distinct forms of long-term memory, and to explore the relationship between them. Episodic memory refers to conscious memory for new events, and depends on the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Incremental stimulus-response learning refers to gradual learning of stimulus-response regularities over many trials, and is thought to depend on the basal ganglia (BG). While initial evidence has suggested that the neural substrates of these forms of memory operate as distinct and independent memory systems, recent data alternately suggest that the MTL and BG may jointly contribute to both forms of knowledge or that there may be a competitive interaction between these neural systems. Beyond MTL and BG, other data indicate that the acquisition and expression of both of these forms of memory are modulated by prefrontal cortex (PFC). The proposed research will address fundamental questions regarding the nature of MTL, BG, and PFC contributions to episodic and incremental learning, and the relationship between them. We will use fMRI to examine the temporal dynamics of activity within, and between, each system over the course of learning. We specifically aim to understand how the temporal profile of neural activity during learning relates to changes in memory performance (Expts 1-3). We will subsequently examine the nature of the relationship between the systems more directly, by determining how modulation of each system impacts activity and performance of the other. These fMRI studies will test whether functional coupling or competition exists between these systems, how such interactions change over time, and whether putative between-system interactions are direct or mediated (Expts 4-6). Finally, we will specifically examine the role of PFC in incremental and episodic learning, and in mediating putative between-system interactions during learning, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). EEG will specify the temporal profile of PFC contributions to episodic and incremental learning (Expts 7-8), and the obtained fMRI and EEG data will guide TMS disruption of PFC function to test the necessity of PFC mechanisms for learning (Expts 9-10). Collectively, the proposed research will advance understanding of the temporal and spatial characteristics of MTL, BG, and PFC involvement in episodic and incremental learning, including whether and how interactions between these neural systems impact memory. The resulting knowledge will provide a foundation for understanding memory impairments in various neurological diseases and mental disorders that are associated with MTL, BG, and PFC dysfunction, including schizophrenia.

"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently.

In the past decade there has been a growing awareness of the disabling effects of impaired cognition in individuals with schizophrenia and the importance of developing new treatments that target cognitive deficits. During this same period, the cognitive neuroscience field has seen an explosion of new knowledge regarding the neural basis of cognition.

"Genetic contributions to deficits in adaptive function in schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goals of schizophrenia research are to achieve understanding of the relationships between its genetic and environmental risk factors, biological and mental abnormalities, and pharmacological and psychosocial interventions effective in prevention/treatment of associated pathology. My career goal is to establish an effective, inter-disciplinary research program that will improve our understanding of schizophrenia throughout its multiple levels of pathology. The present project will be an important step toward this goal because it will take an inter-disciplinary approach to examine molecular genetic and neurocognitive bases of a core feature of schizophrenia - deficits in adaptive function. My doctoral training as a cognitive neuroscientist, followed by a post-doctoral fellowship in psychiatric neuroimaging and electrophysiology, have provided me with the necessary expertise to study neurocognitive phenotypes of schizophrenia. I now wish to integrate my training in neuropsychiatry with training in genetics that will enable me to investigate the association between specific genes and neurocognitive phenotypes of schizophrenia. Mass. General Hospital provides an ideal environment for this training as it unites a number of outstanding laboratories working in neuroscience, psychiatry, and genetics. Despite recent progress in understanding the molecular biology of the DLPFC, the neurocognitive mechanisms by which this system contributes to maladaptive behavior in schizophrenia are not yet well understood. Our preliminary data suggest that DLPFC mechanisms mediating specific real-world knowledge critical for flexible behavior are impaired in schizophrenia. The overall goal of this project is to examine contributions of COMT and MTHFR genes, known to influence prefrontal function, to these abnormalities. We will assay target neurocognitive mechanisms by recording high spatial resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and cost-effective electrophysiological (ERR) data while schizophrenia patients and healthy controls participate in a novel, ecologically valid paradigm that presents real-world goal- directed behaviors, conveyed in video clips.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study may clarify the neurocognitive interpretation of the contributions of two candidate genes to the symptoms of schizophrenia.

"Genetic contributions to deficits in adaptive function in schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goals of schizophrenia research are to achieve understanding of the relationships between its genetic and environmental risk factors, biological and mental abnormalities, and pharmacological and psychosocial interventions effective in prevention/treatment of associated pathology. My career goal is to establish an effective, inter-disciplinary research program that will improve our understanding of schizophrenia throughout its multiple levels of pathology. The present project will be an important step toward this goal because it will take an inter-disciplinary approach to examine molecular genetic and neurocognitive bases of a core feature of schizophrenia - deficits in adaptive function. My doctoral training as a cognitive neuroscientist, followed by a post-doctoral fellowship in psychiatric neuroimaging and electrophysiology, have provided me with the necessary expertise to study neurocognitive phenotypes of schizophrenia. I now wish to integrate my training in neuropsychiatry with training in genetics that will enable me to investigate the association between specific genes and neurocognitive phenotypes of schizophrenia. Mass. General Hospital provides an ideal environment for this training as it unites a number of outstanding laboratories working in neuroscience, psychiatry, and genetics. Despite recent progress in understanding the molecular biology of the DLPFC, the neurocognitive mechanisms by which this system contributes to maladaptive behavior in schizophrenia are not yet well understood. Our preliminary data suggest that DLPFC mechanisms mediating specific real-world knowledge critical for flexible behavior are impaired in schizophrenia. The overall goal of this project is to examine contributions of COMT and MTHFR genes, known to influence prefrontal function, to these abnormalities. We will assay target neurocognitive mechanisms by recording high spatial resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and cost-effective electrophysiological (ERR) data while schizophrenia patients and healthy controls participate in a novel, ecologically valid paradigm that presents real-world goal- directed behaviors, conveyed in video clips. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study may clarify the neurocognitive interpretation of the contributions of two candidate genes to the symptoms of schizophrenia.

"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience.

"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction.

"Olfaction in the Psychosis Prodrome: Behavioral and ERP Measures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Olfactory function is disturbed in schizophrenia, as identified by behavioral markers (smell identification and odor threshold) and olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs). These disturbances are also present in unaffected family members, which make them good candidates as potential biomarkers of schizophrenia risk. Smell identification deficits were found to discriminate who among high-risk cases will actually develop schizophrenia. Little is, however, known about the underlying pathophysiology of emerging psychosis during the prodromal period. This R21 application brings together clinical researchers doing prodromal studies and investigators with expertise in cognitive and electrophysiologic studies in schizophrenia. The proposed study will use improved methods for ERP analyses and for identifying at-risk young people so as to evaluate in cross-section behavioral and electrophysiological measures of olfactory function in prodromal patients, and their association with symptom features and measures of social and cognition function. If olfactory ERPs are found to be abnormal in prodromal patients, we will then apply for an R01 to evaluate whether olfactory ERPs in a prodromal cohort may be a biomarker of conversion to schizophrenia. ERPs and behavioral detection responses will be measured in 30 prodromal patients and 30 matched healthy controls to three concentrations of hydrogen sulfide during a detection task. This will take advantage of existing methods for precise control of olfactory stimuli (olfactometer) and also new data analytic techniques in the electrophysiologic domain. Current source density (CSD; surface Laplacian) and temporal principal components analysis (PCA) are combined to yield reference-free measures of radial current flow corresponding to meaningful olfactory ERP components. Auditory ERPs will also be measured during a novelty oddball detection task so as to begin to examine the modality specificity of olfactory ERP deficits. Interviewer-based and self-ratings of psychopathology, measures of social function, facial emotion recognition, and cognitive function will be used to examine the relation of ERP and behavioral olfactory deficits in patients to prodromal symptoms, social function, and cognition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: From a clinical perspective, the study of prodromal patients is of importance not only for discovering markers for predicting conversion to schizophrenia but also for the potential development of treatments that would precede the onset of psychosis.

"Learning and Compression in Human Working  Memory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An important, yet relatively unexplored aspect of learning and working memory is how, and under what conditions, a perceiver can capitalize on regularities in the environment to remember more information. How can our prior experiences influence how we remember our current experiences? How can such influences be exploited as tools to enhance cognitive processes in those with learning disabilities (e.g., in Autism), or to assist those with memory deficits? To address these issues, this proposal makes use of a powerful form of implicit learning known as visual statistical learning. Previous research has shown that observers are extremely sensitive to regularities in the visual environment (e.g., quickly learning that 'A' is usually followed by 'B'). Surprisingly, this learning is often completely implicit: when asked to explicitly report these regularities observers perform at chance. This implies that visual statistical learning is a powerful process that operates automatically without our intent or conscious control. However, it remains unclear what the benefits of visual statistical learning are for memory processes. In particular, statistical regularities are a form of redundancy, and to the extent that human memory compresses redundant information, learning regularities between objects should enable observers to remember information about more objects. The proposed experiments have three aims: (1) to determine whether visual statistical learning enables observers to compress information and remember more, (2) to determine the ""units"" of compression, and (3) to determine the ""level"" at which compression occurs. To investigate these issues, observers will be required to remember simple objects. Over time, some observers will see patterns in the input (e.g., 'A' often occurs with 'B'), while other observers will see random input. To the extent that observers can learn regularities, and compress them to form more efficient memory representations, observers in the patterned group should remember details about more objects. Previous research has not directly explored how visual statistical learning impacts the capacity of working memory, and the proposed studies will provide important insight into the interactions between learning and memory.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An exciting aspect of this proposal is that it promises to inform basic science by studying how statistical learning impacts working memory and cognition, and therefore has potential to increase understanding of mental illnesses with learning or memory related symptoms.

"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD.

"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory system interactions is potentially important for developing treatments for memory deficits.",Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning,9893633,R01NS088567,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Blinking', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Data', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pontine structure', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Prosencephalon', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'granule cell', 'indexing', 'learned behavior', 'learning extinction', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,374781,0.015363418343224501
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting.

"Whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness. Genetic factors have been strongly implicated. The genetic contribution to schizophrenia is, however, likely to be complex and difficult to capture by merely considering sequence variation. DNA methylation studies represent a particularly promising complement for several reasons. First, as methylation is directly related to gene expression, knowledge of gene methylation levels may add to the prediction of disease status. Second, methylation studies can provide insight into phenomena such as age of onset, the episodic nature of schizophrenia, gene-environment interactions, parental effects, and sex differences. Third, methylation sites are also excellent new drug targets as they are modifiable by pharmacological interventions. Finally, methylation markers are accessible at the stable DNA level, which from a translational perspective means that they can potentially also be used in clinical settings to improve diagnosis and treatment.  Methylation studies have historically been restricted to a limited number of candidate genes. However, it has recently become technically and economically feasible to measure the methylation status of millions of markers simultaneously. This resembles recent developments in genomewide association studies (GWAS), which have accelerated the discovery of disease variants considerably. To identify methylation sites related to schizophrenia, we have applied statistical theory developed by our group to determine the most cost-effective study design. Based on these optimal design calculations, we propose a whole genome methylation profiling study in 750 schizophrenia cases and 750 controls. To eliminate false discoveries due to technical and sampling errors, we will follow up the most promising sites in an independent sample of schizophrenia cases and controls using pyrosequencing. Our current power calculations suggest that we may need to follow up 65 regions in 800 cases and 800 controls. However, one strength of the statistical method we developed is that it can be used adaptively--that is, the optimal sample size and number of markers for the second pyrosequencing replication stage can be empirically determined based on parameters estimated from the first, array-based discovery stage. In order to improve our understanding of the disease mechanisms, secondary analyses will be performed relating the methylation regions to clinical information as well as to a genome-wide panel of already available SNP markers and copy number variant calls.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics. This achievement will be a crucial step towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of cognition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities and s disrupted in diseases such as schizophrenia. The long-term goals of this project are to characterize neural activity dynamics related to working memory in diverse brain regions, and to account for those dynamics in an integrated, brain-wide fashion in terms of cellular and circuit mechanisms. These goals will be achieved by observing, mapping, and perturbing brain circuits using advanced technologies which will be disseminated to the entire neuroscience community to accelerate progress towards understanding brain function and dysfunction.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory,9126618,U01NS090541,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Ramp', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory Process', 'Short-Term Memory', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social computing', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,75000,0.0993207813562661

Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics.

"Investigating emotional reactivity in depression using event-related potentials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is of immense public health importance because of its high prevalence, early onset, chronicity, and functional impairment. While behavioral and peripheral physiological studies have identified a deficit in emotional reactivity associated with MDD, leading to an emotion context insensitivity (ECI) theoretical model, neuro imaging studies have yielded evidence of both hypo- and hyperactivity depending on the region of interest and the type of affective stimuli used. One possibility is that emotional reactivity in MDD is moderated by the personal relevance of stimuli, such that reactivity to normative stimuli is blunted and reactivity to idiographic stimuli is increased, although this has yet to be tested within a single sample. The proposed study seeks to examine this issue using three direct measures of brain activity: event-related potentials (ERPs), spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By integrating these three methods, this study will be well-equipped to enhance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying abnormal emotional processing in MDD, which is consistent with the mission of the Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral Science at the National Institute of Mental Health. Further, by seeking to systematically characterize specific neural abnormalities in MDD, the current study may provide objective biological measures that can inform future work on clinical issues such as treatment selection, tracking treatment progress, and predicting recovery. To examine the influence of personal relevance on abnormal emotional processing in MDD, the proposed research will consider neural activity among 30 adults with current MDD and 30 never-depressed controls, with three specific aims: (a) to compare ERP/EEG responses to normative and idiographic emotional stimuli; (b) to compare ERP/EEG responses to reward- and performance-based feedback; and (c) to use fMRI to examine neural activation to emotional faces and rewards.

"An fMRI Investigation of Source Memory in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a serious and debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects 2.2 million Americans.1 Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often complain about poor memory and evidence suggests that individuals with OCD exhibit deficits on a variety of tasks, including tasks that are unrelated to obsessional concerns. As patients with OCD tend to focus on details and miss the larger context, the construct of source (contextual) memory may be particularly relevant to memory impairments in OCD. Memory for different types of information (object versus contextual information) may rely on various regions within the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe, and may be differentially impacted by obsessive- compulsive symptoms. Using a novel task, 20 individuals with OCD and 20 healthy controls (age 18 to 50) will study objects in the context of four rooms. While undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), participants will receive a memory test that will assess source and object recognition. This study will address two Aims: 1) examine whether individuals with OCD differ in their memory for multicontextual information 2) utilize neuro imaging to determine whether differences exist in neural correlates of memory between OCD patients and healthy controls. The proposed project will be the first study to investigate the relationship between object and contextual memory and functional activation patterns in patients with obsessive- compulsive disorder. This project addresses the NIMH goal of developing an integrative understanding of brain-behavior processes that provide the foundation for understanding mental disorders. The proposed study will further our understanding of neurocognitive functioning in obsessive-compulsive disorder and will provide a vehicle to advance the applicant's development toward becoming an independent investigator.

"PCr-based fMRSI Biomarker for Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular evidence that schizophrenia is a disorder of synaptic elimination was provided by in vivo 31P MRS studies of never-medicated, first-episode schizophrenia subjects. Recent genetic studies also support the role of synaptic elimination in schizophrenia. A recent in vivo 31P-1H MRS study of normal childhood and adolescent subjects (N = 105, 6-18 years) showed that phosphocreatine (PCr) is the most sensitive molecular biomarker for regionally specific synaptic elimination. The aim of this proposal is to develop in Year 1 quantitative functional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (fMRSI) at 3.0 Tesla (2x2x2 cm3 voxel size) with application to schizophrenia subjects in Year 2. Noninvasive in vivo, functional PCr-based 31P fMRSI (PCr-fMRSI) will use published fMRS activation paradigms with appropriate modification for PCr-fMRSI. PCr-fMRSI should be more closely linked to synaptic activity than fMRI. To examine neuromolecular underpinnings of schizophrenia we propose to setup and optimize visual stimulation and MR parameters in humans for a PCr-fMRSI visual stimulation paradigm (i.e., with and without primary visual cortical stimulation in the form of radial red/black checkerboard flickering at 8 Hz) which has been shown to stimulate the human primary visual cortex. Also, we propose to evaluate, clinically and neuropsychologically, a small cohort of chronic schizophrenia subjects (n = 16, ages 18 to 55 yrs; 8 cognitively intact, 4 males, 4 females; 8 cognitively impaired, 4 males, 4 females) whose cognitive function range from normal to severe, generalized cognitive impairment and control subjects matched for age, gender, length of illness, and parental education (Nn = 28, ages 18 to 55 yrs, 10 males, 6 females). We propose to perform PCr-fMRSI (2x2x2 cm3 voxel size) with primary visual cortical stimulation and MRI on these chronic schizophrenia and normal control cohorts to include the following regions of interest, left and right: dorsal prefrontal cortex; superior temporal cortex; inferior parietal cortex; and occipital cortex. Structural volumetric MRI will be performed enabling the volume of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid to be determined on the same voxels that the functional PCr- fMRSI measurements are obtained. Diffusion tensor imaging anisotropy measurements will be performed to study white matter deficits in schizophrenia and their relationship to regions that show fPCr-MRSI activation. This study will develop PCr-fMRSI to study synaptic membrane depolarization-repolarization which will be applied to chronic schizophrenia to test the hypothesis of exaggerated synaptic elimination in dorsal prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects compared with healthy controls.        Cognitive deficits are relatively common in chronic schizophrenia with poor functional outcome. This application is to develop a molecular biomarker of schizophrenia based on PCr-based functional 31P MRS to detect differences in synaptic elimination in schizophrenia compared with healthy controls.

"PCr-based fMRSI Biomarker for Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular evidence that schizophrenia is a disorder of synaptic elimination was provided by in vivo 31P MRS studies of never-medicated, first-episode schizophrenia subjects. Recent genetic studies also support the role of synaptic elimination in schizophrenia. A recent in vivo 31P-1H MRS study of normal childhood and adolescent subjects (N = 105, 6-18 years) showed that phosphocreatine (PCr) is the most sensitive molecular biomarker for regionally specific synaptic elimination. The aim of this proposal is to develop in Year 1 quantitative functional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (fMRSI) at 3.0 Tesla (2x2x2 cm3 voxel size) with application to schizophrenia subjects in Year 2. Noninvasive in vivo, functional PCr-based 31P fMRSI (PCr-fMRSI) will use published fMRS activation paradigms with appropriate modification for PCr-fMRSI. PCr-fMRSI should be more closely linked to synaptic activity than fMRI. To examine neuromolecular underpinnings of schizophrenia we propose to setup and optimize visual stimulation and MR parameters in humans for a PCr-fMRSI visual stimulation paradigm (i.e., with and without primary visual cortical stimulation in the form of radial red/black checkerboard flickering at 8 Hz) which has been shown to stimulate the human primary visual cortex. Also, we propose to evaluate, clinically and neuropsychologically, a small cohort of chronic schizophrenia subjects (n = 16, ages 18 to 55 yrs; 8 cognitively intact, 4 males, 4 females; 8 cognitively impaired, 4 males, 4 females) whose cognitive function range from normal to severe, generalized cognitive impairment and control subjects matched for age, gender, length of illness, and parental education (Nn = 28, ages 18 to 55 yrs, 10 males, 6 females). We propose to perform PCr-fMRSI (2x2x2 cm3 voxel size) with primary visual cortical stimulation and MRI on these chronic schizophrenia and normal control cohorts to include the following regions of interest, left and right: dorsal prefrontal cortex; superior temporal cortex; inferior parietal cortex; and occipital cortex. Structural volumetric MRI will be performed enabling the volume of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid to be determined on the same voxels that the functional PCr- fMRSI measurements are obtained. Diffusion tensor imaging anisotropy measurements will be performed to study white matter deficits in schizophrenia and their relationship to regions that show fPCr-MRSI activation. This study will develop PCr-fMRSI to study synaptic membrane depolarization-repolarization which will be applied to chronic schizophrenia to test the hypothesis of exaggerated synaptic elimination in dorsal prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects compared with healthy controls.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive deficits are relatively common in chronic schizophrenia with poor functional outcome. This application is to develop a molecular biomarker of schizophrenia based on PCr-based functional 31P MRS to detect differences in synaptic elimination in schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. This could be extremely useful in predicting functional outcome and monitoring response to therapeutic measures.              Cognitive deficits are relatively common in chronic schizophrenia with poor functional outcome.

"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.

"Characterizing Intrinsic Functional Cortical Networks in Parkinson Disease Dementia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop PD-related dementia (PDD) making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in PD. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. We propose that the treatment and prevention PDD may also prove possible by advancing our understanding of the neurophysiology underlying cognitive dysfunction. We will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. The long- term goal is to advance our understanding of the neurophysiology underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of functional connectivity critical to normal cognition are disrupted by subcortical pathology in PDD. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of our own preliminary data and other recent research. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of network functional connectivity are associated with cognitive phenotypes in PD based on either a) the severity of cognitive dysfunction; or b) specific cognitive domains affected; 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for PDD based on measures of intrinsic network functional activity using a machine learning approach; and 3) Explore the potential role of subcortical sources on cortical network activity and cognition using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). These Aims are achievable within a two-year timeframe as they will involve analyses of a single data set of resting MEG data from 25 control subjects, 25 PDD subjects, 25 PD subjects with normal cognition and 25 PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The feasibility of this proposal is aided by leveraging a currently funded NINDS K02 Independent Scientist Award (1 K02 NS080885-01A1). Data and biomarkers generated by this R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant will provide a foundation for future studies to validate state- defining and predictive biomarkers; mechanistic studies on the role of acetylcholine and dopamine in cognition; and therapeutic studies of physiologic or pharmacologic interventions targeting physiological and regional abnormalities. The approach is innovative as the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction across cognitive domains and severity levels in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to PDD biomarker development; and the first use of DCM to model cortical and subcortical contributions to PDD. The proposed research is significant because it will advance our understanding of the neurophysiology of PD-related cognitive dysfunction and will provide biomarkers, empiric models and therapeutic targets essential to developing more effective interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause of dementia in PD and there are no effective treatments.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness.

"4/4-Psychosis and Affective Research Domains and Intermediate Phenotypes (PARDIP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic symptoms are present in a significant subset of individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and carry devastating personal and clinical implications. Most biomedical research on BD has ignored the variable presentation of psychosis possibly overlooking biologically significant heterogeneity in BD; such heterogeneity may cause inconsistencies in the literature by treating BD as a homogenous category 7,18. The expression of psychosis in some BD patients (BD-P) and absence in others (BD-NP) may indicate divergent disease processes of critical nosological and clinical relevance. PARDIP leverages a large sample of BD, a comprehensive battery, and sophisticated analytic tools to establish whether BD-P and BD-NP represent a difference in degree or a difference in kind.  Long-term goals: This work will critically impact how BD is classified and studied, provide robust targets for effective future etiological studies, and clarify the utility of available biomarkers o major psychiatric disturbance. PARDIP represents a step toward mechanistically based classification of psychiatric disorders.  Specific Aims: PARDIP will (i) identify the patterns of bo-cognitive disruptions which mark psychosis (BD-P`BD-NP) or mood instability in general (BD`healthy comparisons), (ii) explore how these biomarkers relate to one another and to other dimensions of psychopathology present in BD, and (iii) utilize latent class and cluster analyses of the multivariate dataset to verify taxonicity within BD with regard to psychosis and uncover latent psychiatric subgroups of interest for future genotyping and etiological research.  Methods: The three-year PARDIP project will recruit 135 psychotic BD, 135 non-psychotic BD, and 135 psychiatrically healthy comparison subjects (all new recruits), administering a comprehensive battery focused on the psychosis and mania domains of psychopathology. We will obtain measures of neurophysiology, (smooth pursuit eye movements, antisaccades, auditory ERPs), cognition (cognitive battery, response inhibition, spatial working memory), neuroanatomy (structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), emotional processing (ERPs to emotional pictures), intrinsic brain state (resting functional MRI connectivity), and circadian function (Actigraphy). We will compare biomarkers between BD-P, BD-NP, and H groups to determine which track with psychosis and which track with affective disturbance. We will identify common sources of variance among measures with joint-ICA and PCA approaches, and examine how biomarkers and biomarker composites relate to other aspects of clinical heterogeneity. Taxometric procedures (MAXCOV- HITMAX and its multivariate extension MAXEIG-HITMAX and k-means clustering) will be carried out with the multivariate dataset to empirically identify distinct subgroups of subjects. PARDIP will be conducted by 4 experienced research groups (across 3 collection sites) with a long history of close and productive collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multisite project built upon and benefiting from the extensive infrastructure of the ongoing BSNIP consortium will collect a comprehensive battery of biological, neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic, cognitive, and clinical measures from a large sample of Bipolar Disorder (BD) patients to determine whether BD patients with psychosis and BD patients without psychosis represent a difference in degree or a difference in kind Multivariate and taxometric analyses will leverage the extensive, comprehensive dataset to i) characterize the overall structure and clinical covariates of identified biomarkers, ii) test the validity of a categorical BD-P vs. BD- NP distinction, and iii) uncover latent psychiatric subgroups.

"Psychosis and Affective Research Domains and Intermediate Phenotypes (PARDIP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic symptoms are present in a significant subset of individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and carry devastating personal and clinical implications. Most biomedical research on BD has ignored the variable presentation of psychosis possibly overlooking biologically significant heterogeneity in BD; such heterogeneity may cause inconsistencies in the literature by treating BD as a homogenous category 7,18. The expression of psychosis in some BD patients (BD-P) and absence in others (BD-NP) may indicate divergent disease processes of critical nosological and clinical relevance. PARDIP leverages a large sample of BD, a comprehensive battery, and sophisticated analytic tools to establish whether BD-P and BD-NP represent a difference in degree or a difference in kind.  Long-term goals: This work will critically impact how BD is classified and studied, provide robust targets for effective future etiological studies, and clarify the utility of available biomarkers o major psychiatric disturbance. PARDIP represents a step toward mechanistically based classification of psychiatric disorders.  Specific Aims: PARDIP will (i) identify the patterns of bo-cognitive disruptions which mark psychosis (BD-P`BD-NP) or mood instability in general (BD`healthy comparisons), (ii) explore how these biomarkers relate to one another and to other dimensions of psychopathology present in BD, and (iii) utilize latent class and cluster analyses of the multivariate dataset to verify taxonicity within BD with regard to psychosis and uncover latent psychiatric subgroups of interest for future genotyping and etiological research.  Methods: The three-year PARDIP project will recruit 135 psychotic BD, 135 non-psychotic BD, and 135 psychiatrically healthy comparison subjects (all new recruits), administering a comprehensive battery focused on the psychosis and mania domains of psychopathology. We will obtain measures of neurophysiology, (smooth pursuit eye movements, antisaccades, auditory ERPs), cognition (cognitive battery, response inhibition, spatial working memory), neuroanatomy (structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), emotional processing (ERPs to emotional pictures), intrinsic brain state (resting functional MRI connectivity), and circadian function (Actigraphy).

"4/6 Psychosis and Affective Research Domains and Intermediate Phenotypes (PARDIP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic symptoms are present in a significant subset of individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and carry devastating personal and clinical implications. Most biomedical research on BD has ignored the variable presentation of psychosis possibly overlooking biologically significant heterogeneity in BD; such heterogeneity may cause inconsistencies in the literature by treating BD as a homogenous category 7,18. The expression of psychosis in some BD patients (BD-P) and absence in others (BD-NP) may indicate divergent disease processes of critical nosological and clinical relevance. PARDIP leverages a large sample of BD, a comprehensive battery, and sophisticated analytic tools to establish whether BD-P and BD-NP represent a difference in degree or a difference in kind.  Long-term goals: This work will critically impact how BD is classified and studied, provide robust targets for effective future etiological studies, and clarify the utility of available biomarkers o major psychiatric disturbance. PARDIP represents a step toward mechanistically based classification of psychiatric disorders.  Specific Aims: PARDIP will (i) identify the patterns of bo-cognitive disruptions which mark psychosis (BD-P`BD-NP) or mood instability in general (BD`healthy comparisons), (ii) explore how these biomarkers relate to one another and to other dimensions of psychopathology present in BD, and (iii) utilize latent class and cluster analyses of the multivariate dataset to verify taxonicity within BD with regard to psychosis and uncover latent psychiatric subgroups of interest for future genotyping and etiological research.  Methods: The three-year PARDIP project will recruit 135 psychotic BD, 135 non-psychotic BD, and 135 psychiatrically healthy comparison subjects (all new recruits), administering a comprehensive battery focused on the psychosis and mania domains of psychopathology. We will obtain measures of neurophysiology, (smooth pursuit eye movements, antisaccades, auditory ERPs), cognition (cognitive battery, response inhibition, spatial working memory), neuroanatomy (structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), emotional processing (ERPs to emotional pictures), intrinsic brain state (resting functional MRI connectivity), and circadian function (Actigraphy). We will compare biomarkers between BD-P, BD-NP, and H groups to determine which track with psychosis and which track with affective disturbance. We will identify common sources of variance among measures with joint-ICA and PCA approaches, and examine how biomarkers and biomarker composites relate to other aspects of clinical heterogeneity.

"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia.

While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9616654,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2018,701530,0.10839459147883998
"The mutual influence of attention and learning during knowledge acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective learning involves extracting key patterns of information that capture the essence of our experiences and using this information to build useful knowledge that enables predictive behavior in novel situations. Humans have multiple learning systems associated with different brain regions, yet how these learning systems interact is not well understood. Also, existing theories largely ignore how information sampling behaviors are guided by experience and goals during learning. The research presented in this proposal will use a novel theoretical perspective in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking to investigate the mechanisms of attention and learning and their interactions during category learning. The key hypothesis is that during learning, individuals must choose what information to sample, which will be guided by the person's knowledge and current goals. A class of computational models will be developed that recasts category learning as a dynamic decision process in which attention emerges as information processing guided by the learner's goals, capacity limitations, and current knowledge. These models plan a course of action (e.g., eye movements) by looking ahead and evaluating future actions for expected profit. Experiment 1 will test the key prediction of these models that sequential sampling behavior during category learning is mediated by the interaction of attention and knowledge components. Fitting these models to eye movement and classification behavior from perfect and imperfect learners will characterize the nature of information sampling and learning processes that promote optimal category learning. In Experiments 2 and 3, model components will be linked to the specific neurobiological learning systems implicated in category learning. Experiment 2 will develop and validate a novel method of linking formal models to the learning brain by using multivariate brain patterns of fMRI data to adjudicate among competing cognitive models. The key reasoning of this method is that if a model represents the true nature of category learning, continuous measures of that model's states during learning should be reflected in trial-by-trial measures of the learning brain. Experiment 3 will employ this novel model selection method to characterize how interactions between prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and the medial temporal lobe support successful category learning. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support attention and knowledge will provide a means of predicting and promoting effective learning. Moreover, this work has the potential to inform the development of diagnostic tools that precisely characterize cognitive impairments in clinical populations that exhibit learning deficits, such as individuals with schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease.

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness.

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning.

"A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic spectrum disorders (PSD) are difficult to differentially diagnose and treat, typically leaving their victims with lifetime disability. It is increasingly becoming recognized that traditionally distinct disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychotic features share overlapping symptoms. For example, in addition to positive symptoms, PSD patients also experience deficits in cognitive control/executive functioning, which likely result from dysregulation of the mesocortical and mesostriatal pathways. Importantly, cognitive deficits contribute to deficits in interpersonal and occupational functioning, more traditional clinical symptoms (e.g., disorganized thinking) and are currently refractory to treatment. The current application will use novel recruiting strategies and novel multivariate analytic techniques to establish empirical, neuronally-based cluster metrics (i.e., circuit-level pathologies) that are associated with impairments in cognitive control (primary outcome) and everyday functioning (secondary outcome) in PSD regardless of traditional diagnoses (DSM-V). Other potential mediating variables evaluated in the current model include negative symptoms and disorganized thinking. We investigate potential causal mechanisms for these circuit- level pathologies by examining the aggregation of specific genetic mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) within three neurotransmitter (dopamine, glutamate and GABA) signaling pathways, axonal guidance pathway, and synaptic long-term potentiation pathways based on our preliminary data. Finally, an exploratory aim evaluates whether the expression of cognitive control deficits across multiple psychiatric illnesses is mediated by each individual's total number of rare deletions in DNA (copy number variations; CNVs). To evaluate these hypotheses, 175 continuously recruited PSD patients will complete an extensive clinical battery and undergo multimodal neuroimaging. Evoked and intrinsic hemodynamic activity will be used in conjunction with white matter assays (diffusion tensor imaging) to investigate the integrity and connectivity of the cognitive control circuit (dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) during a multisensory cognitive control task with real-world validity. PSD patients will be classified into meaningful entities based on univariate and multivariate indices of grey/white matter pathology in the cognitive control network using a K-means algorithm. We will then determine the predictive validity of these clusters for describing deficits in cognitive control and everyday functioning, using the leave-one-out methodology to verify the model. Thus, the current application utilizes multiple units of analyses (genes, circuits, self-report, behavior, and paradigms) from the NIMH Research Domain Criteria to develop a novel classification system based on neurophysiological and genetic biomarkers of impaired cognitive control that spans traditional diagnostic categories. We are confident that moving beyond traditional nosologies will result in more meaningful diagnoses and ultimately more successful treatments for refractory symptoms, leading to substantial improvements in mental health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Psychotic spectrum (schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, and bipolar disorder I with history of psychotic features) disorders (PSD) are a large public health concern that results in tremendous interpersonal and societal costs. Although traditionally classified as separate entities, these diverse disorders share common psychotic symptoms, as well as similar cognitive deficits, disease courses and genetic determinants. However, the underlying reasons (e.g., abnormalities in brain circuitry, genetic make-up, etc.) why PSD patients tend to exhibit similar phenomenological behaviors (e.g., positive symptoms in conjunction with poor cognitive control) have yet to be elucidated. The current proposal will utilize novel analytic methods and neuroimaging techniques to classify PSD patients into meaningful sub-groups based on objective pathology within frontal brain circuits. We will also examine whether behavioral deficits and brain abnormalities are dependent on genetic factors. At the end of this proposal, we will produce a rich, publically available dataset that can be used to increase our collective understanding of these devastating diseases.",A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology,9252586,R01MH101512,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delusional disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Hallucinations', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Occupational', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Refractory', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophreniform Disorder', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'axonal guidance', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain circuitry', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic risk factor', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'self reported behavior', 'success', 'white matter']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,594853,0.05237160876041347

Although traditionally classified as separate entities, these diverse disorders share common psychotic symptoms, as well as similar cognitive deficits, disease courses and genetic determinants.

The current proposal will utilize novel analytic methods and neuroimaging techniques to classify PSD patients into meaningful sub-groups based on objective pathology within frontal brain circuits.

"A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic spectrum disorders (PSD) are difficult to differentially diagnose and treat, typically leaving their victims with lifetime disability. It is increasingly becoming recognized that traditionally distinct disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychotic features share overlapping symptoms. For example, in addition to positive symptoms, PSD patients also experience deficits in cognitive control/executive functioning, which likely result from dysregulation of the mesocortical and mesostriatal pathways. Importantly, cognitive deficits contribute to deficits in interpersonal and occupational functioning, more traditional clinical symptoms (e.g., disorganized thinking) and are currently refractory to treatment. The current application will use novel recruiting strategies and novel multivariate analytic techniques to establish empirical, neuronally-based cluster metrics (i.e., circuit-level pathologies) that are associated with impairments in cognitive control (primary outcome) and everyday functioning (secondary outcome) in PSD regardless of traditional diagnoses (DSM-V). Other potential mediating variables evaluated in the current model include negative symptoms and disorganized thinking. We investigate potential causal mechanisms for these circuit- level pathologies by examining the aggregation of specific genetic mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) within three neurotransmitter (dopamine, glutamate and GABA) signaling pathways, axonal guidance pathway, and synaptic long-term potentiation pathways based on our preliminary data. Finally, an exploratory aim evaluates whether the expression of cognitive control deficits across multiple psychiatric illnesses is mediated by each individual's total number of rare deletions in DNA (copy number variations; CNVs). To evaluate these hypotheses, 175 continuously recruited PSD patients will complete an extensive clinical battery and undergo multimodal neuroimaging. Evoked and intrinsic hemodynamic activity will be used in conjunction with white matter assays (diffusion tensor imaging) to investigate the integrity and connectivity of the cognitive control circuit (dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) during a multisensory cognitive control task with real-world validity. PSD patients will be classified into meaningful entities based on univariate and multivariate indices of grey/white matter pathology in the cognitive control network using a K-means algorithm.

"Stress and MDD effects on mPFC Glutamate and GABA during reward processing Project Summary With a lifetime prevalence of 16%, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is predicted to become the second leading cause of death and disability in the United States by the year 2020. A core feature of MDD is reward- processing deficits in the form of decreased reward motivation and anhedonia. These deficits have been linked to alterations in corticostriatal networks in MDD, but less is known about the specific mechanisms that may contribute to these changes. One candidate mechanism is alterations in medial prefrontal glutamate (Glu) and GABA, both of which have recently been implicated in both MDD, as well as a key risk-factor for the development of MDD, stress. To date however, no study has provided an in vivo assessment of Glu and GABA function in response to psychosocial stress in MDD or in healthy controls. To address this question, the K99 phase of this application proposes the following training goals. First, in order to develop the technical skills needed to assess Glu and GABA in vivo, the candidate will learn MR-Spectroscopy techniques from Dr. J. Eric Jensen (K99 Co-mentor) and Dr. Dost Ongür (Consultant). This will involve the completion of a combined MRS/fMRI study that will explore the relationships between baseline Glu and GABA function and BOLD fMRI signals during reinforcement learning in healthy participants. Second, the candidate will deepen his understanding of the role of Glu and GABA function in reward processing through directed readings with Dr. Kent Berridge (Consultant) as well as their relevance to the pathophysiology of mood disorders through readings supervised by Dr. Ongür. Third, he will build upon his behavioral modeling skills developed in graduate school through the application of a reinforcement learning paradigm and associated Q-learning model analysis, which will be supervised by Dr. Michael Frank (Consultant); the candidate will also attend Dr. Frank’s lab meetings on a monthly basis as well as his course “Computational Cognitive Neuroscience”. Finally, the candidate will receive guidance and supervision from his primary mentor, Dr. Diego Pizzagalli, in the integration multimodal imaging data, design and analysis of laboratory stressors, and preparation towards the development of an independent laboratory. During the independent phase, two additional multimodal imaging studies are proposed that will combine MRS assessment of Glu and GABA function with fMRI measures of reinforcement learning both before and after a psycho-social stressor. The first of these studies will be focused on healthy controls, while the second will include a sample of patients with MDD and matched controls. Through its use of multimodal imaging focused on two major neurotransmitters, a pre-post stress manipulation and inclusion of both controls and MDD patients, the proposed research will provide important new insights into the role of Glu and GABA function in the pathophysiology of reward processing deficits in MDD. Project Narrative Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a debilitating mental illness that is frequently associated with symptoms of low motivation and anhedonia. Prior work suggests that these symptoms may result from alterations in medial prefrontal glutamate and GABA signaling, which may disrupt normal corticostriatal circuit function, but direct evidence is lacking.

To address this gap, the proposed research will use pre- and post-stress measures of MR- Spectroscopy of medial prefrontal glutamate and GABA in combination with fMRI during a reward-learning paradigm to investigate the relationships between amino-acid neurotransmission, reward learning behavior and functional neuroimaging measures in healthy controls and MDD patients.",Stress and MDD effects on mPFC Glutamate and GABA during reward processing,8788444,K99MH102355,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amino Acids', 'Aminobutyric Acids', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Cause of Death', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protons', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Punishment', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'depressive behavior', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,K99,2015,32316,0.03309408273584347
"Stress and MDD effects on mPFC Glutamate and GABA during reward processing  Project Summary With a lifetime prevalence of 16%, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is predicted to become the second leading cause of death and disability in the United States by the year 2020. A core feature of MDD is reward- processing deficits in the form of decreased reward motivation and anhedonia. These deficits have been linked to alterations in corticostriatal networks in MDD, but less is known about the specific mechanisms that may contribute to these changes. One candidate mechanism is alterations in medial prefrontal glutamate (Glu) and GABA, both of which have recently been implicated in both MDD, as well as a key risk-factor for the development of MDD, stress. To date however, no study has provided an in vivo assessment of Glu and GABA function in response to psychosocial stress in MDD or in healthy controls. To address this question, the K99 phase of this application proposes the following training goals. First, in order to develop the technical skills needed to assess Glu and GABA in vivo, the candidate will learn MR-Spectroscopy techniques from Dr. J. Eric Jensen (K99 Co-mentor) and Dr. Dost Ong¿r (Consultant). This will involve the completion of a combined MRS/fMRI study that will explore the relationships between baseline Glu and GABA function and BOLD fMRI signals during reinforcement learning in healthy participants. Second, the candidate will deepen his understanding of the role of Glu and GABA function in reward processing through directed readings with Dr. Kent Berridge (Consultant) as well as their relevance to the pathophysiology of mood disorders through readings supervised by Dr. Ong¿r. Third, he will build upon his behavioral modeling skills developed in graduate school through the application of a reinforcement learning paradigm and associated Q-learning model analysis, which will be supervised by Dr. Michael Frank (Consultant); the candidate will also attend Dr. Frank's lab meetings on a monthly basis as well as his course ""Computational Cognitive Neuroscience"". Finally, the candidate will receive guidance and supervision from his primary mentor, Dr. Diego Pizzagalli, in the integration multimodal imaging data, design and analysis of laboratory stressors, and preparation towards the development of an independent laboratory. During the independent phase, two additional multimodal imaging studies are proposed that will combine MRS assessment of Glu and GABA function with fMRI measures of reinforcement learning both before and after a psycho-social stressor. The first of these studies will be focused on healthy controls, while the second will include a sample of patients with MDD and matched controls. Through its use of multimodal imaging focused on two major neurotransmitters, a pre-post stress manipulation and inclusion of both controls and MDD patients, the proposed research will provide important new insights into the role of Glu and GABA function in the pathophysiology of reward processing deficits in MDD.

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions.

"Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy PROJECT ABSTRACT Epilepsy surgery involving the anteromedial temporal lobe (ATL) often results in deficits of language or memory. The best clinical predictor of postsurgical cognitive deficits is the extent to which tissues around the epileptogenic focus were spared during resection. We recently showed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) can predict normative variance in higher-order cognition; rs-FC has subsequently been shown to outperform lesion-based analyses for modeling stroke-related deficits of higher-order cognitions including memory. The proposed retrospective analyses of existing datasets will evaluate the prognostic value of rs-FC for modeling presurgical deficits of language and memory among patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 1 will replicate our methodology for relating rs-FC to cognitive ability using an independent normative sample of healthy control subjects acquired at Emory University. Aim 2 will evaluate the clinical utility of our method by modeling the influence of clinical symptoms (such as seizure frequency and laterality of epileptogenic focus) upon the relationship between rs-FC and presurgical memory and/or language deficits within a sample of patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 3 will use machine learning approaches to evaluate rs-FC's ability to explain presurgical cognitive deficits relative to other MRI modalities (such as anatomic volume, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and task-based fMRI activity). The proposed model-based and hypothesis- driven research plan would critically evaluate resting-state fMRI's prognostic capability to explain epilepsy- related cognitive deficits, and thus establish the necessary methodological groundwork for future prospective analyses using rs-FC to predict postsurgical cognitive outcomes.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse.

"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes.

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI.

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION PROJECT DESCRIPTION Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our proposal promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art “Connectome Skyra”, an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of “Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering”, which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain’s white matter tracts. Our proposal benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory.

Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9444124,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2017,3087282,0.06561741953721734
"Protein network of high risk copy number variants for psychiatric disorders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and intellectual disability are major burden to society. Our current knowledge of their underlying pathophysiology remains limited. However, a contribution of genetic factors has been clearly demonstrated. The goal of this study is to discover shared biological mechanisms between autism, schizophrenia and related disorders through investigation of the networks of interactions between proteins encoded by the high risk genetic factors implicated in these disorders.  It is now firmly established that rare Copy Number Variants (CNVs): (1) play significant role in the risk of psychiatric disorders; (2) many high-risk CNVs cross disorder boundaries and are implicated in several psychiatric disorders. CNVs generally involve multiple genes, and how this large number of functionally heterogeneous genes contributes to the pathology is not completely understood.  To advance our understanding of CNV contribution to psychiatric diseases, we propose to investigate how the genes from high risk rare CNVs interact on a protein level. The knowledge of the networks connecting CNV genes will help to better understand their pathological impact in different disorders. Using the constructed networks, we will test the hypotheses that: (1) cross-disorder CNVs share interacting protein partners that may explain shared etiology of different disorders; (2) cross-disorder CNVs have a unique set of interacting partners that may explain the differences between disorders.  We have selected 11 high risk CNVs (containing 169 genes) that are firmly implicated in two or more psychiatric disorders for this study. Literature search fr binary protein-protein interactions (PPIs) for these 169 genes demonstrated that 33% of them have no PPIs annotated in the public databases, and only 3.5% of them interact with each other. However, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that literature PPIs are biased toward highly studied proteins, incomplete, and often are not as reliable as commonly assumed. Here, we are proposing to perform an unbiased protein interaction screen for 169 genes from high risk cross-disorder CNVs. Our Specific Aims are as follows: (1) Assemble a library of 169 open reading frame (ORF) clones corresponding to genes from 11 CNVs that confer high risk to psychiatric disorders; (2) Build and validate the cross-disorder CNV interactome; (3) Identify and perform follow-up functional studies of the interacting partners that are shared by or are unique to cross-disorder CNVs.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed study will gain insights into shared molecular mechanisms of four psychiatric disorders.

"Improving long-term retention of generalized knowledge and detailed memory by shaping neural representations during learning PROJECT SUMMARY    Optimal learning methods often differ based on task goals, whether it be enhancing generalized knowledge that  can be flexibly applied to new contexts or remembering specific details of a single event. Research has  identified different neural codes that support these two different types of learning: integrated representations  stored in anterior hippocampus (aHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) promote knowledge that is  generalizable, whereas pattern separated representations stored in posterior hippocampus (pHPC) and lateral  prefrontal cortex (lPFC) promote descrimination and specificity. However, there is a general lack of  understanding of how integrated and separated neural representations may compete or interact, and how  different learning experiences can shape the formation and retention of different neural representations to drive  subsequent behaviors. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanisms and training  conditions that promote the successful acquisition and retention of different types of knowledge. We propose a  neuro-­computational approach to examine category learning, which allows us to simulteneously measure and  assess trade-­offs associated with the acquisition and retention of generalized (category-­level) and detailed  (exemplar-­level) knowledge as a function of different learning experiences. In Aim 1, we will use model-­based  fMRI analyses to characterize how attention biases formation of neural representations in aHPC via  interactions with mPFC to improve generalization at the cost of specificity. In Aim 2, we will manipulate stimulus  presentation order to determine how different learning experiences can bias individuals to form general  (integrated) vs. specific (pattern-­separated) knowledge representations in HPC and PFC using representational  similarity analysis (RSA) techniques. In Aim 3, we will use connectivity measures and RSA to identify neural  patterns within the HPC-­PFC circuit that predict successful consolidation of general vs. specific information and  determine the conditions associated with successful long-­term retention of knowledge. Findings from these  proposed studies can help uncover ways to improve training paradigms and target learning interventions to  individualize and optimize knowledge retention. This research is particularly relevant to patients with Alzeimer’s  disease, epilepsy, and dementia, who experience profound deficits in learning and memory retention.       PROJECT NARRATIVE    The proposed research examines how neural representations are shaped during different learning experiences  to promote learning and memory retention through distinct mechamisms. In doing so, this research will provide  important insights into targeting learning interventions that can enhance the acquisition and retention of  knowledge in various clinical populations. Findings from this research will provide important insights into  helping individuals suffering from neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and stroke-­ induced dementias compensate for associated learning and memory deficits by optimzing training conditions  that promote the formation of neural representations associated with long-­term retention. ",Improving long-term retention of generalized knowledge and detailed memory by shaping neural representations during learning,9619982,F31NS105353,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dementia', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'classical conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'memory retention', 'neglect', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural patterning', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F31,2018,34974,0.05339562679737142
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.

To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.            ",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,8960792,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2015,437426,0.017552937408659083
"Investigation of Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson Disease Parkinson Disease (PD) causes progressive motor and non-motor deficits with 75% of patients developing dementia after 10 years. A growing body of evidence suggests the involvement of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the cortical pathology of PD that has been linked to accumulation of α-synuclein and neurodegeneration. Yet, how regional Aβ accumulation relates to decline in specific cognitive domains and to deficits in regional neuromodulatory transmitter systems remains unknown. This study will test the hypotheses that 1) Aβ measurements made by Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) correlate to postmortem proteinopathy. 2) deficits in selected cognitive domains (executive function, attention, visuospatial ability, and memory scores) will correlate regionally to PiB and postmortem measures of tau, Aβ, and α-syn proteinopathy; 2) PiB imaging and cognitive deficits will correspond to regional neurochemical changes in postmortem tissue; and 3) accumulated Aβ predicts deterioration in specific cognitive domains and the time to dementia. To test these questions, I will use a large, previously-recruited cohort of 287 participants with PD and controls that have undergone baseline PET imaging scans of PiB and ongoing longitudinal (baseline and 3-year follow-up) comprehensive cognitive testing. Cross-sectional analyses of PiB uptake and selected cognitive deficits will be assessed using appropriate statistical techniques with a data-drive, whole-brain, parameterized voxel-based approach to identify regions associated with PD-driven cognitive impairment. Neurochemical and pathophysiological analyses will be conducted on postmortem tissue from the 47 deceased participants with pathologically confirmed PD who had PET PiB scans in life to determine the relationship between PiB uptake and post- mortem deposition of Aβ and α-synuclein. Correlations between PiB uptake in life and changes in regional distribution of pathological protein aggregates and behaviorally-relevant neuromodulators (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine) will then be compared in regions associated with cognitive impairment. Whether PiB uptake can predict decline in specific cognitive domains or time to onset of dementia will be determined using baseline PiB imaging and longitudinal cognitive data. This study and my mentorship team will provide training relating to neuroimaging, neurochemistry, and behavioral manifestations of PD and analytical approaches to integrating questions of transmitter activity and cognitive output. This training will provide the basis for moving forward toward a career as an independent investigator through formal and informal professional development and laboratory management training. This study will help elucidate the relationship between cognitive dysfunction in PD and regional pathology, identifying new targets for treatment in PD. Findings from this study will inform the development of PET tracers and help identify deficits related to specific behavioral symptoms including depression, apathy, executive dysfunction, or visuospatial dysfunction. This study will investigate the relationship between Amyloid-β (Aβ) proteinopathy and the progression of neurochemical abnormalities and cognitive deficits in Parkinson Disease (PD). Using positron emission tomography scans of Aβ obtained in life and regional measures of proteinopathy and neurotransmitter system dysfunction in postmortem brains, we will ask whether specific regional pathologies underlie cognitive deficits in selected domains and whether baseline measures of Aβ predict future cognitive decline and dementia.

"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions.

The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.            ",Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,8808026,R03MH105765,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arbitration', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality Control', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'case control', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'disease classification', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,74072,0.04238814132372656
"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of language, perception, memory, social cognition and decision-making. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism.",2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,9541371,R13NS106864,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'language perception', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social cognition', 'sound', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,20000,0.034634093539930404
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,0.000933282509566377
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation.

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9920230,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,676651,0.016180649158300482

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits.

"Computational and Circuit Mechanisms Underlying Rapid Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The mammalian brain has a remarkable ability to store and retrieve information. Detailed memories can be formed after as little as one exposure, and those memories can be retained for decades. This ability is compromised following damage to structures located in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and the adjacent cortex. Over the past decade, many studies have highlighted interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex, in particular, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), as having an essential role in memory consolidation. However, the circuit mechanisms that support memory consolidation are not well-understood, particularly in the primate brain. Impaired memory is an important component of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, depression, and schizophrenia that collectively affect over twenty million Americans. Our long-range goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie memory processes, in order to bring us closer to developing new therapies for these disabled patients. Psychological theories and behavioral studies have suggested that rapid, single-trial accumulation of information is facilitated by prior knowledge, a cognitive map or “mental schema” that provides a framework onto which new information can be assimilated. This concept is relevant for understanding potential hippocampal-neocortical interactions in the service of memory consolidation. The experiments proposed here will directly examine the neural circuits in the hippocampus, PFC, and PPC that support schema development and new learning. The overall goal of this U-19 Program is to develop a comprehensive theory of the circuit mechanisms that support rapid learning. To achieve these goals, we will make use of a multi-laboratory research framework with an ambitious effort that requires multiple areas of expertise, exemplified by our team members. Our team effort is organized around four Research Projects, each supported by Data Science and Administrative Cores. Through parallel projects in monkeys and humans, we will perform large-scale recordings simultaneously across the hippocampus, PFC and PPC to assess modulations in cross-regional connectivity during schema development and new association and categorization learning. Complementary theoretical approaches will integrate large-scale circuit modeling of the human and nonhuman primate brain based on measured mesoscopic connectivity and training recurrent neural networks to perform cognitive tasks. We will test the hypothesis that in the course of schema instantiation, a task structure is encoded in the form of a low-dimensional structure in the space of connection weights, which is reflected in a low- dimensional subspace of neural dynamics. During new learning, the system benefits from the schema to narrow weight parameter search, thereby speeding up learning. We hypothesize that this process is observable at the level of dynamical inter-areal interactions. Taken together, the experiments proposed under this Program will provide a comprehensive, cross-species investigation of the neural mechanisms of rapid learning.

"New approaches to understand neuronal microcircuit dynamics for working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the temporary storage of information for future manipulation to guide actions, is an essential component of nearly all cognitive processes. Deficits in working memory contribute to a variety of mental health disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Working memory is thought to be an emergent property of neurons acting in groups to form microcircuits. However, due in large part to technical limitations, working memory has been studied nearly exclusively at the scales of entire brain regions or individual neurons, both of which fail to reveal interactions in neuronal populations. A major challenge in understanding the neural mechanisms for working memory is to develop tools to measure, analyze, and model working memory at the scale of the neuronal microcircuit. In this application, we present approaches to solve this challenge using two-photon imaging of activity in neuronal populations in mice performing working memory tasks in virtual reality. We will combine our large imaging data sets with theoretical modeling approaches to develop new computational models of how working memory is generated in microcircuits. First, we will examine how working memory representations are encoded in neuronal populations by examining the stability of representations over long timescales, using chronic two- photon imaging of the same neurons over weeks during working memory behaviors. Second, we will perform imaging experiments during novel working memory tasks to test competing, long-standing theoretical models of working memory, including models based on attractor dynamics and sequence dynamics. Third, we will develop a new theoretical modeling framework in conjunction with rapid experiment-model iterations to generate and test new microcircuit-scale hypotheses for the neural mechanisms underlying working memory. Together the proposed work is expected to establish new approaches to measure, analyze, and model microcircuit function during working memory in the mouse, leading toward mechanistic studies of how working memory and its underlying microcircuits are disrupted in mental illness.

We will combine our large imaging data sets with theoretical modeling approaches to develop new computational models of how working memory is generated in microcircuits. First, we will examine how working memory representations are encoded in neuronal populations by examining the stability of representations over long timescales, using chronic two- photon imaging of the same neurons over weeks during working memory behaviors. Second, we will perform imaging experiments during novel working memory tasks to test competing, long-standing theoretical models of working memory, including models based on attractor dynamics and sequence dynamics. Third, we will develop a new theoretical modeling framework in conjunction with rapid experiment-model iterations to generate and test new microcircuit-scale hypotheses for the neural mechanisms underlying working memory. Together the proposed work is expected to establish new approaches to measure, analyze, and model microcircuit function during working memory in the mouse, leading toward mechanistic studies of how working memory and its underlying microcircuits are disrupted in mental illness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Working memory is essential for nearly all cognitive functions and is disrupted in diseases including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The proposed projects combine experimental measurements and theoretical models to understand how working memory is implemented in neuronal microcircuits. By investigating working memory at a level not studied extensively (the microcircuit), our results are expected to reveal new insights into cognitive functions both in health and disease.",New approaches to understand neuronal microcircuit dynamics for working memory,9506839,R01MH107620,"['Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Storage', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Property', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stable Populations', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'recurrent neural network', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,612342,0.10091123243978473
"Disordered Cellular Interactions in Prefrontal Local Circuits: a New Mechanistic Theory of Schizophrenia with Convergent Evidence across Animal Models PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder that ranks among the top 10 health burdens worldwide, yet current treatment options are not effective for many patients. In order to develop new therapies, we must gain a better understanding of how the physiology of the brain is altered in the disease. This will require links to be established between pathophysiological processes that occur at the levels of synaptic transmission, neuronal activity patterns, circuit dynamics, information processing, and finally cognitive performance. Our current body of knowledge is based on the two extremes of this spectrum: genetic defects that lead to dysfunction in cellular function on one end, changes in global brain activation patterns and cognitive performance on the other. What we are missing is an intermediate link at the level of neural circuits, or more specifically, an understanding of how distortions of the spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity in schizophrenia ultimately derail the computations performed by the networks, leading to cognitive failure.  A widely-accepted theoretical model of schizophrenia called the disconnection hypothesis posits that the disease results from disordered functional connectivity between brain regions. While some functional imaging evidence supports this theory, it has never been tested at the neuronal circuit level and thus a mechanistic framework has not been developed. Here we propose to test the central hypothesis that schizophrenia is a disease in which aberrant action potential timing in prefrontal circuits leads to weakening of synaptic connections over time, through established mechanisms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity.  In the Specific Aim 1, we propose to analyze a previously collected dataset of neuronal activity obtained from nonhuman primates performing a working memory task after receiving a drug that mimics features of schizophrenia. Preliminary analysis of this data suggests that spiking activity is disordered such that cells in the same local circuits are desynchronized and functional connectivity between cell pairs is reduced; these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that spike timing disruption leads to functional disconnection in schizophrenia. We will further develop these analyses and relate them to the disruptions in cognitive processing that parallel those seen in human schizophrenic patients. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to conduct large-scale neural recordings in transgenic mice in order to investigate how a mutation that increases risk for schizophrenia changes the properties of neuronal interactions. We will apply similar analytical techniques to the neural data from Aims 1 and 2 in order to maximize the translational power of both animal models. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we propose to perform computational neural network simulations in order to establish a theoretical framework that causally links disordered spike timing to functional disconnection. The information gained through these studies will form a basis for a new theoretical framework of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia which can be used to guide a rational search for new treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder which affects approximately 1% of the global population, including 3 million Americans, yet current treatments are not effective because we have an insufficient understanding of the pathological mechanisms of the disease. We propose to investigate how aberrant electrical activity leads to changes in local network dynamics and ultimately a breakdown in cognitive processing, using a unique approach that involves analysis of neural data from two animal models of the disease in addition to computational simulations of neuronal networks. This research will provide a new understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia which could be used to identify new targets and strategies for intervention.",Disordered Cellular Interactions in Prefrontal Local Circuits: a New Mechanistic Theory of Schizophrenia with Convergent Evidence across Animal Models,9542379,F30MH108205,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Modelings', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'NMDA receptor antagonist', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Organizational Change', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Model', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive performance', 'evidence base', 'foot', 'functional restoration', 'genome wide association study', 'imaging study', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'parallel processing', 'receptor function', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe mental illness', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F30,2018,48003,0.030666593804508827
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD.

"Uncovering Basic Signaling Mechanisms in NK Cells in Mice and Humans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that defend us by lysing tumor and pathogen-infected cells. Recent experiments showed generation of long-lived ""memory"" NK cells in mouse and humans challenged by viral infections (such as CMV), similar to that of memory lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system. We seek to develop a quantitative mechanistic framework with predictive powers for signaling and activation in NK cells including ""memory"" NK cells in mice and humans by using a synergistic combination of in silico modeling and wet lab experiments. The in silico modeling rooted in statistical physics, non-linear dynamics, and multivariate statistics will be combined with standard biochemical and multi-parametric single cell mass cytometry (CyTOF mass cytometer) experiments on engineered human NK cell lines (NKLs), and naive and ""memory"" NK cells from mice and humans. We will investigate three overlapping aims: Aim 1: Develop a quantitative mechanistic framework for analyzing signaling and activation of NK cells stimulated by activating and inhibitory CMV-encoded ligands. Aim 2: Determine differences in signaling mechanisms between naive and ""memory"" NK cells in the mouse. Aim 3: Determine differences in signaling mechanisms between mouse and human ""memory"" NK cells. At the successful completion of the aims we will have a quantitative predictive mechanistic framework for studying NK cell signaling in mice and humans. The systems level knowledge gained from the proposed projects can also be applied in understanding mechanisms of activation regulated by heterogeneous receptor ligand interactions in other immune cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The developed in silico models with predictive powers will help generate new hypotheses and design experiments for studying NK cell activation. The basic mechanisms that underlie development and response of naive and ""memory"" NK cells in humans are likely to provide guidelines to manipulate those mechanisms for therapeutic applications.",Uncovering Basic Signaling Mechanisms in NK Cells in Mice and Humans,8878729,R56AI108880,"['Agonist', 'Antibodies', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytolysis', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Entropy', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'NK Cell Activation', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Noise', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'design', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'pathogen', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'secondary infection', 'statistics', 'tumor']",NIAID,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R56,2014,454652,0.03774558202864501
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might

example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐

"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9644559,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'classification trees', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'regression trees', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2019,176985,0.006786710178750372

This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.

"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables.

"Spiking network models of sharp-wave ripple sequences with gamma-locked attractor dynamics The hippocampus is a critical structure for learning and memory in the mammalian brain. During  active exploration, hippocampal circuits support the activity of place cells that track an animal’s  position as it moves. The spatial representations of place cells in a particular environment  collectively form a spatial map, the function of which remains largely unclear. During periods of  rest, the hippocampus switches to a network state characterized by stochastic and highly variable  activity patterns. A prominent feature of this irregular activity is recurring strong bursts of  excitation, called sharp waves, that recruit large proportions of hippocampal neurons and sweep  across the circuits of the hippocampus. Sequentially ordered activation of place cells during sharp  waves is considered to serve a critical role in memory consolidation. In addition to replaying  recently experienced routes, sharp wave sequences can follow unexplored paths through space and can  be biased to goal destinations according to reward value. This project will investigate an explicit  theoretical framework for flexible sequence generation in service of prospective route planning for  navigation. The theory rests on the observation that the same network that initiates sharp waves,  the hippocampal CA3 region, also prominently carries a distinct lower-frequency band of gamma  oscillation. One study has shown that the slow gamma rhythm modulated spiking activity during sharp  wave sequences, such that the phase of gamma with the strongest activity corresponded to periods  when the decoded sequence would dwell, or ‘hover’, at discrete spatial locations. Informed by  recording data from that study, this project will develop realistic hippocampal network models to  study how sharp waves and slow gamma oscillations might emerge simultaneously. On the basis of that  physiological model, spatial activity will be embedded into the synaptic weights of the network to  assess whether sharp waves and slow gamma interact to support gamma-locked attractor dynamics, and  how that interaction depends quantitatively on the synaptic modifications for spatial learning. In  particular, focus will be placed on a puzzling experimental demonstration that sharp wave sequence  recall slows down during learning. The long-term objective is to fully evaluate whether these  emergent phenomena support a unified framework for the function of spatial maps in navigation on  the basis of enabling flexible generation of novel sequences. A clear theoretical understanding of  these key hippocampal phenomena in realistic networks will elucidate their role in memory,  planning, and disease states. How do the neuronal networks of the hippocampus learn to generate sequences of spatial activity  that help animals find their way in a changing world? We propose computational models and  mathematical analysis to investigate a theory in which the tendency of recurrent networks to  converge to a small number of low-energy states is rhythmically destabilized by gamma oscillations  concurrently generated by the network. Our project integrates theory with benchmarks from  high-density recording data to reveal neurocomputational functions of hippocampal activity patterns  that serve critical roles in health and disease.",Spiking network models of sharp-wave ripple sequences with gamma-locked attractor dynamics,9775500,R03NS109923,"['Animals', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Route', 'Services', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'classical conditioning', 'density', 'dentate gyrus', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'mathematical analysis', 'memory consolidation', 'model development', 'network models', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spatial relationship', 'statistics', 'theories', 'virtual']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,81875,0.009166449011575874
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data.

"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'distraction', 'emotion regulation', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'memory process', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory stimulus', 'stimulus processing', 'subclinical depression', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,0.0804599703580135
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes.

"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9162788,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,407688,0.0646575633138478
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span.

"Characterization of Variability in Motivation and Reward in Psychosis Project Summary/Abstract This is an NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program (R21) proposal entitled, “Characterization of Variability in Motivation and Reward in Psychosis.” Motivational deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia and related disorders and are associated with poor community outcomes and reduced treatment adherence and efficacy during behavioral interventions such as cognitive remediation. Motivation and reward are not unitary constructs but are comprised of measurable and separable domains, as delineated in the RDoC Positive Valence Systems Domain, which may be differentially associated with illness traits, outcomes, and treatment response. However, characterization of dysfunction across the PVS domain using multiple measures across units of analysis has not been undertaken in psychosis, and whether profiles of deficits emerge and are differentially associated with clinical and community functioning or predictive of treatment outcomes has not yet been tested. In the present proposal we aim to measure multiple constructs across the PVS Domain using a multivariate battery across units of analysis in a cross-diagnostic sample of patients with psychosis (n=200) and healthy controls (n=50), and examine the structure of this domain using principal components analysis. We will use emergent factors to then a) examine associations between factors and clinical, cognitive, and community functioning measures, and with motivated behaviors using validation measures; and b) identify groups of patients who share similar PVS factor profiles using cluster analysis. Similar approaches have successfully uncovered meaningful groupings previously obscured by group-level means comparisons (5, 8) using such techniques, permitting the examination of profiles of patients along constructs of interest map more closely to outcomes and neurobiological correlates than do heterogeneous groupings like diagnosis (6,7).

"Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission Project Summary  Bipolar disorder is characterized by variability in mood symptoms and cognitive impairment which leads to functional impairment both during depression and even during periods of remission. A major clinical challenge is that patients exhibit substantial variability in treatment response despite having the same clinical diagnosis, which suggests heterogeneity in underlying neurobiological dysfunction. In this R03, our aims are to deﬁne speciﬁc frontal- cingulate cognitive control and amygdala-frontal emotion regulatory neural clusters in brain activation and connectivity using dimensional tasks of cognitive control and acute threat. We will also develop neurocognitive and emotional proﬁles of the neural clusters we identify.  To accomplish our aims, we will analyze an existing dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, obtained in previous NIMH studies at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program, from bipolar disorder subjects (65 remitted and 21 depressed) and 65 healthy controls. We will use a novel approach, called Dimensional Neural Clustering, to classify fMRI data. Our approach is based on techniques used in other serious illnesses with multiply- determined outcomes, such as breast cancer, that have revolutionized treatment by identifying subgroups and made invaluable life-saving contributions. After computing brain activation and connectivity associated with the neural circuits underlying cognitive control (activated by response inhibition) and acute threat (activated by emotion regulation), we will use Dimensional Neural Clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Dimensional Neural Clustering differs from previous machine-learning approaches because we will use neurobiology to deﬁne subgroups of patients, rather than to classify patients based on a clinical diagnosis.  We hypothesize that patients can be classiﬁed based on inhibitory and regulatory neural clusters. Moreover, the neural clusters will be associated with differential phenotypic expression characterized by neurocognitive performance, mood/anxiety symptoms, and the ability to reappraise/suppress emotion. Our demonstration of neural subtypes of bipolar disorder will provide a basis for a neurobiologically-driven approach to understanding bipolar disorder, on which we can elaborate in future dimensional work. Our ﬁndings will provide a foundation for future work to personalize treatment. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience different disease symptoms and have varied responses to treatments for depressive episodes. Such variability within patients who have the same clinical diagnosis suggests signiﬁcant underlying neural heterogeneity that is not captured by current diagnostic criteria. We will implement a novel approach that uses functional neuroimaging data to generate a neurobiologically-driven classiﬁcation of people with bipolar disorder to guide future work in personalizing treatment.",Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission,9169470,R03MH110877,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease phenotype', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'statistics', 'success', 'sugar', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,77000,-6.627459209007605e-05
"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

"Neural mechanisms of specificity and generalization learning Project summary Memory-based cognition depends on both the ability to remember specific details of individual experiences (specificity) and the ability to combine information across experiences to derive new knowledge (generalization). It is well established that the hippocampus rapidly encodes specific events, but the mechanisms of memory generalization are less clear. Traditionally, a division of labor has been postulated between the hippocampus, learning rapidly to support specificity, and other memory systems, learning slowly and incrementally to support generalization. More recent research has also shown a role of the hippocampus in rapid generalization, where new knowledge is derived by combining information across a small number of events. It is currently debated whether the hippocampal contribution to generalization is fully explainable by its role in storing specific experiences or whether the hippocampus integrates information across experiences to form generalized knowledge. Furthermore, it is unclear whether generalization learning proceeds at the expense of memory for specific details or whether multiple types of memory representations form and co-exist to serve multiple forms of cognition. The current project tests the hypotheses that representations at distinct levels of specificity form in parallel along the long axis of the hippocampus through interactions with distinct cortical regions. More anterior generalized representations inform generalization. More posterior specific representations support memory specificity but can also inform generalization decisions under circumstances when generalized representations have not been formed. To test these hypotheses, the proposed studies use functional MRI in humans during concept-learning tasks in which both specificity and generalization learning is indexed using (1) behavioral methods, (2) cognitive modeling and model-based fMRI, and (3) neural pattern similarity analyses. The studies will determine the mechanism(s) of memory generalization and how it relates to memory for specific events, the degree to which the formation of distinct representation is under strategic control, and the hippocampal-cortical interactions that contribute to specificity and generalization learning. The results will reveal whether specificity and generalization are two behavioral expressions supported by a single neural representation, a single neural system that can form different types of memory representations under different task demands, or distinct neural systems that form distinct representations. The results will inform current theories of memory function and help reconcile a decades-long debate regarding the nature of concept representations. The basic science knowledge obtained here will help shed light on the memory and generalization mechanisms that may go awry in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Memory allows us to remember specific past experiences, but also find commonalities across experiences generalizable to novel situations. The proposed research will improve our understanding of mechanisms supporting memory specificity and generalization, their contribution to decision-making, and their implementation in the healthy brain. These findings will generate new predictions about the causes of a wide variety of memory impairments, such as reduced memory specificity in aging and Alzheimer’s disease, imbalance of specificity and generalization learning in anxiety, depression, and autism, and mixed patterns of impairments following a stroke.",Neural mechanisms of specificity and generalization learning,10051347,R01NS112366,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Episodic memory', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,322278,0.08802046807553483
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,0.01794314861674861

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility.

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis.

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  The goal of the parent grant is to delineate abnormalities in the development of structural and functional brain networks associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders including attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the psychosis spectrum (PS). However, critical aspects of executive dysfunction remain unexplored. First, sex differences in executive function are substantial, and disorders with prominent executive dysfunction (such ADHD and psychosis) are more prevalent in males. Notably, the aims of the parent grant only proposed to examine executive dysfunction across males and females, and did not propose to examine how sex-specific network abnormalities relate to sex differences in executive function. Second, the parent grant focuses on the broad construct of executive function, which is composed of multiple specific cognitive domains including working memory, performance monitoring, set shifting, inhibition, and sustained attention. At present, the aims of the parent grant do not propose to identify specific links between brain networks and these component processes. In this supplement, we will fill these important gaps in the parent grant using advanced tools from network science and machine learning. To do this, we will capitalize upon an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of irritability in youth that provides highly relevant data and is nearly complete (n=200). Findings in this valuable dataset will be replicated in the parent grant as data accrues. Together, this supplement will provide novel insights regarding the network-level substrates of executive dysfunction and provide the candidate with a superb training experience in computational psychiatry. This training will position him to succeed in a top neuroscience graduate program.

"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.

"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure.

"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks.

"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'cost', 'critical period', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'myelination', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,0.01441720970955994
"Multiplexing working memory and timing: Encoding retrospective and prospective information in transient neural trajectories. Abstract A general principle of brain function is the ability to store information about the past to better predict and prepare for the future. Working memory and timing are two computational features that evolved to allow the brain to use recent information about the past to accomplish short-term goals. Working memory refers to the ability to transiently store information in a flexible manner, while timing refers to the ability to generate well timed motor responses, modulate attention in time, and predict when external events will occur. To date working memory and timing have primarily been treated as independent processes. Here we propose that because the brain seeks to use information about the past to predict the future, that working memory and timing are often multiplexed. Specifically, that the neural patterns of activity recorded during the delay period of many working memory tasks encodes both retrospective information about the past, as well as prospective predictions about the future. To test this hypothesis, we have developed novel variant of the delayed- nonmatch-to-sample task, in which the first cue predicts the duration of the delay, that is, how long an item must be held in working memory. This task will allow us to determine if network level population responses encode both retrospective information about the past and prospective information about delay duration. Preliminary results from a supervised recurrent neural network model predict that the temporal structure of the neural patterns of activity elicited by both cues will be different. This prediction will be tested using large scale Ca2+-imaging to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in brain areas associated with working memory and timing. Additionally, optogenetic perturbation experiments and longitudinal characterization of the emergence of neural patterns of activity will be performed. These experiments, will in turn, be used to ground computational studies aimed at understanding the neuronal and circuit level learning rules that underlie the emergence of patterns that encode working memory and time. Project Narrative Working memory and the ability to generate timed motor responses are essential for carrying out most daily tasks, and impaired in many neurological and psychiatric conditions. Yet, the brain regions, activity patterns, and learning rules that drive working memory and timing are not understood. Here we propose that the brain often multiplexes both forms of information, and we will use a novel behavioral task along with computational and experimental methods to test this hypothesis.",Multiplexing working memory and timing: Encoding retrospective and prospective information in transient neural trajectories.,9971022,R01NS116589,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caliber', 'Code', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Mydriasis', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Reaction Time', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'neocortical', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,616556,0.1009260183064773
"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience – to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction.

"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,0.06106896242868549
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations. The effects of music on memory in naturalistic settings are not yet well understood. In this  project, we aim to study how memory for films is affected by the presence or absence of the film  score and whether these effects can be measured neurally. This work will help develop new  neural measures of music-evoked episodic memory as well as expand our understanding of music's  effect on memory under natural conditions.",The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative,10071610,F99NS118740,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Music', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'memory recall', 'memory retrieval', 'movie', 'novel', 'portability', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,0.0944297665292244
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,9872025,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,0.06228654667144553
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain.

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive.

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001).

"Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning Project Summary Learning from rewards is one of the fundamental roles of the nervous system, allowing for beneficial behaviors to be repeated, and detrimental behaviors to be avoided. It has recently become clear that when humans learn from rewards in the environment, they rely on multiple neural systems that work in tandem. What are the psychological and biological constraints of these systems, and how do they interact during learning? The proposed experiments are designed to answer these questions by developing precise computational models of human instrumental learning, as well as investigating the neural dynamics of, and interactions between, individual learning processes. Aim 1 will focus on isolating individual learning processes, further developing a novel model of human instrumental learning that highlights contributions to learning from both a flexible executive working memory module and an incremental reinforcement learning module. Behavioral experiments and computational modeling will be used to better characterize these two learning processes, with a focus on how they interact instantaneously and over time. Aim 2 will use a combination of brain stimulation and neuroimaging to better characterize the neural systems supporting each learning process, as well as the putative interactions between these neural circuits. These results will constrain our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive human instrumental learning. The knowledge gained by this project will provide a vital framework for clinical applications, for instance, in understanding and treating working memory related learning deficits in schizophrenia, and reinforcement learning deficits in Parkinson's disease. Critically, a more precise model of individual learning processes could guide the development of clinical protocols that leverage intact learning systems when other learning systems are compromised. Finally, an enhanced understanding of human reward-based learning could improve theories of habit formation, which may further inform psychological and neurophysiological models of addiction.

"Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations PROJECT SUMMARY Network analysis of brain connectivity, or Connectomics, has emerged as an important interdisciplinary field, making strides in advancing both fundamental scientific knowledge on the structure of the brain, as well as providing insights into the pathology of neurological disorders. Advances in neuroimaging technologies have enabled acquisition of high-resolution datasets on brain activities in normal and diseased populations, while advanced machine learning methods hold promise to obtain data-driven insights into the functional architecture of the brain. Functional connectivity analysis is typically carried out in two steps. First, one estimates a network among different brain regions by studying strengths of associations among the time course of neurophysiological signals for different subjects (patients or healthy controls). Next, one compares the networks between different groups of subjects and seeks network features prevalent in specific groups of interest using statistical methods. Two emerging challenges in this field are the presence of heterogeneity amongst subjects in large study cohorts, and developing predictive models to construct robust and interpretable results. The central goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing machine learning methods equipped with uncertainty quantification measures, suitable for high-dimensional network data for heterogeneous populations. Upon completion, these methods are expected to provide automated, robust and more accurate discovery of connectivity patterns that is prevalent in heterogeneous populations of patients. We aim to accomplish this goal by pursuing two specific aims: (1) develop estimation and inference methods for frequency domain measures of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks, (2) develop a framework of mixed effects model of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks that accounts for heterogeneity among subjects and enables discoveries more likely to generalize in large cohorts. For each aim, novel machine learning methods for integrative analysis of structural and functional connectivity will be developed using a mathematical model of network diffusion. We will also calibrate and validate our proposed methods on data from Human Connectome Project, and on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The proposed approach is innovative since it integrates machinery across diverse disciplines, including statistics, machine learning and network analysis to address important challenges learning large functional connectivity graphs. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have both scientific and translational impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding brain connectivity patterns using rigorous machine learning methods can help seek common patterns in large databases in an automated fashion, and can potentially lead to development of neuroimaging based diagnostic tools and sensitive prognostic measures. The proposed research will thus use fundamental scientific knowledge about brain to assist translational research in neurological disease.",Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations,10110789,R21NS120227,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cations', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Interest Group', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain size', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical model', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,428417,0.021585396877719976
"A data-driven reconceptualization of the RDoC construct of working memory: Neural correlates of underlying factors and implications for schizophrenia Project Summary / Abstract  Over two decades of research has focused on elucidating the pathophysiology of working memory (WM) deficits in patients with schizophrenia in the hopes of finding effective treatments, as these deficits are more closely linked to functional outcomes in patients than are psychotic symptoms, and they are presumed to arise from alterations in dopaminergic function that may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, the overwhelming majority of research in this area has treated WM as a unitary cognitive ability that is assayed equally well by any of the wide range of tasks commonly employed in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies of patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that at least three distinct cognitive abilities contribute to performance on WM tasks: attentional control, short-term memory capacity, and long-term (or secondary) memory retrieval. These are presumed to have dissociable neural substrates and may be differentially impaired in different patients, which would serve to obscure potential biomarkers of WM deficit in case-control fMRI studies of patients. The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Matrix attempts to capture some of this complexity by defining four subconstructs of WM (active maintenance, flexible updating, limited capacity, and interference controls), although these differ from those based on empirical work described above, and no empirical work to date has attempted to determine the extent to which various WM tasks tap these four putative subconstructs. The overarching goal of this application is to conduct a large-scale latent-variable analysis of the most commonly employed WM tasks in the fMRI literature of schizophrenia, along with a broad array of other cognitive tasks, in order to clarify the underlying cognitive abilities (or subconstructs) that subserve WM task performance and to identify neural correlates of these empirically identified subconstructs. To this end, 500 participants will undergo behavioral testing on 9 WM and 12 other cognitive tasks in order to provide a robust dataset for latent variable analysis using factor analytic and structural equation modeling techniques that will identify the subconstructs that underlie performance on each of the WM tasks. Next, 80 patients with schizophrenia and 80 matched control participants will undergo the same battery of tasks, but will perform 7 of the WM tasks during fMRI scanning, in order to identify neural correlates of the subconstructs that are specifically disrupted in schizophrenia. This work will help to advance our understanding of WM deficits in schizophrenia and will identify specific neural targets, and the optimal tasks that future investigators can employ to target them, that are disrupted in schizophrenia. These neural targets can then form the basis for establishing target engagement in clinical trials aimed at finding treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Project Narrative  Schizophrenia poses a great social and economic burden in a significant percentage of patients, including increased risk for unemployment, homelessness, incarceration, chronic disability, and reduced life expectancy. This disability is thought to be closely related to cognitive deficits in patients. By seeking to better understand the neural basis of these deficits, this application seeks to identify new brain mechanisms that may be targeted by future treatments in order to improve outcomes in this patient group.",A data-driven reconceptualization of the RDoC construct of working memory: Neural correlates of underlying factors and implications for schizophrenia,9970631,R01MH120293,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Economic Burden', 'Equation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Homelessness', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'Update', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior test', 'biomarker identification', 'case control', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'convolutional neural network', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'functional MRI scan', 'functional outcomes', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'long term memory', 'memory retrieval', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'social', 'treatment research']",NIMH,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,785087,0.12028545084758972
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory.

"Systematic Evaluation of the Effects of Cognitive Remediation across Affective and Non-Affective Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY Psychotic disorders including schizophrenia [SZ] and bipolar disorder [BD] are among the most costly and debilitating psychiatric diseases worldwide. Both SZ and BD are associated with marked cognitive deficits, which are among the strongest predictors of poor community functioning, disability, and reduced quality of life (1-3). Cognitive remediation (CR) is one of the few available interventions to target cognitive symptoms directly. Growing evidence indicates that CR improves cognition in patients with these illnesses at the group level (e.g. 4-6). However, a number of critical knowledge gaps limit our ability to develop robust, individualized CR interventions and provide access to patients who are most likely to benefit: first, CR outcomes are highly heterogeneous and predictors of treatment response have not been identified; and second, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that mediate cognitive and functional enhancement remain largely undetermined. CR trials are challenging, as interventions are often lengthy and intensive, and ascertainment and retention of patients with psychotic disorders is difficult. As a result, the majority of CR studies are underpowered to clearly identify predictors of response, compare treatment effects by diagnosis, examine the ability of CR to drive rapid neural change, and determine the extent to which neural change is associated with cognitive or functional outcomes. These knowledge gaps have limited our ability to develop robust, targeted CR programs and deliver them to patients most likely to benefit. The aims of this project are twofold: 1) identification of patient characteristics associated with cognitive treatment response including baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive variables, and multivariate models; and 2) examination of CR's ability to drive rapid, EEG-measured neural change in key information processing systems, and the associations of this change with primary cognitive outcomes. Over the last eight years our group has completed two separate randomized controlled trials of a 70-hour CR program in patients with SZ and BD with funding from NIMH and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. These studies employed identical CR paradigms, active control conditions, primary (cognitive) and secondary (clinical, functional) outcome measures taken at the same timepoints (baseline, midpoint, and post-treatment), and EEG protocols. We will systematically examine moderator of CR response across the sample including demographic, clinical and cognitive variables; we will then use principal components analysis (PCA) with regression to evaluate factors predictive of CR response, compare univariate predictors with our multivariate models, and explore clustering behavior in responders vs. non-responders. Finally, we will examine early effects of CR training on EEG-measured neurophysiology, and the relationship of neural modulation to cognitive response. This project is uniquely positioned to fill critical gaps in the knowledge by merging two related datasets to form a well- powered study able to answer these questions across affective and non-affective psychosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive remediation is a behavioral intervention shown to be effective at targeting the common and disabling cognitive deficits experienced by patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, not all patients respond to treatment, and predictors of treatment response and neurobiological mechanisms of action remain unknown, due in part to the challenging nature of conducting these clinical trials and resulting small samples. Over the last 8 years our group has completed two separate but related clinical trials of cognitive remediation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Thus, we aim to merge these datasets in order to systematically investigate the predictors of cognitive treatment response including multivariate models, and CR's ability to drive rapid, neural change in key information processing systems in order to fill these knowledge gaps and facilitate development of targeted CR programs for patients most likely to benefit.",Systematic Evaluation of the Effects of Cognitive Remediation across Affective and Non-Affective Psychosis,9977312,R03MH120442,"['Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Factor', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'active control', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'predicting response', 'primary outcome', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'sensory gating', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R03,2020,164000,0.025499679156254836
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness. Simultaneously, this proposal will develop the career of the Principal Investigator, Miklos Argyelan, M.D., as an independent translational researcher.",Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia,9966554,K23MH120504,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrodes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Principal Investigator', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'translational scientist', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2020,194567,0.030702157676607365
"The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation Project Summary  Over the course of our lifetimes, we are bound to experience distressing, negative events we would rather not remember over and over again. Importantly, there is variability in people’s ability to cope with these memories. How do people regulate negative emotional memories, and why are some people better at dealing with negative memories than others? For my dissertation, I will investigate these questions through the lens of cognitive neuroscience, specifically looking at how memory reactivation strength can predict one’s ability to deal with negative memories. Prior work from the Norman Lab has postulated a U-shaped relationship between memory reactivation strength and the fate of a memory: Moderate reactivation leads to memory weakening while strong reactivation leads to strengthening. This proposal examines the impact of memory reactivation strength in 3 studies: In Study 1, I focus on memory suppression, a coping strategy where people try to stop an unwanted memory from coming to mind after it has been triggered by a cue in the environment. I will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to relate the neural measure of memory reactivation during a memory suppression task to subsequent memory reactivation. In this study, for which data collection should be completed by the start of the F99 Phase, I will also examine the impact of inter-subject differences in depression level; prior research has shown that depressed participants appear to demonstrate a negative bias, which might be relevant to how strongly memories are reactivated. In Study 2, I will shift my focus to study cognitive reappraisal, an alternative strategy whereby participants reframe the interpretation of a negative event to mitigate the emotional intensity tied to its memory. Although this strategy requires bringing a memory to mind so that it can be reinterpreted, the impact of memory reactivation on cognitive reappraisal has not been well studied. I will use fMRI to investigate this gap in the literature, using data from a study for which data collection is already underway in the Ritchey Lab. Finally, in Study 3, I will use the eye tracker to study whether the application of temporally targeted visual stimuli can be used to modify subsequent memory performance by modulating memory reactivation strength. Prior research has demonstrated the relevance of using eye-tracking, which has finer temporal resolution and is more accessible than fMRI, to examine memory reactivation. Put together, this work will provide more insight into how memory reactivation strength influences the fate of negative memories, specifically after engaging in memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal. It will also elucidate ways in which memory reactivation can be leveraged and optimized in different coping strategies for dealing with unwanted, negative memories. The expertise of my sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborator will be pivotal to my development as a researcher and the success of my dissertation work. In the K00 Phase, I will expand my knowledge of mental health disorders so that I can be equipped to become an independent researcher at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health disorders. Project Narrative  For my dissertation, I will investigate inter-subject and inter-trial differences in memory reactivation strength and how this variability affects memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal efficacy. This work will help to identify ways in which memory reactivation can be optimally leveraged to help people cope with negative, unwanted memories. Specifically, this work might provide ways to personalize interventions for patients with mental health disorders, such as depression, to increase the therapeutic impact.",The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation,10155909,F99NS120647,"['Affect', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prize', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'coping', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'personalized intervention', 'posters', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus', 'visual tracking']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,0.11208717595738985
"Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning. PROJECT SUMMARY Synaptic dysfunction is a common feature of neuropsychiatric disease. For example, a hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is synaptic fibrilization and aggregation of key proteins that participate in synapse and cell loss. Maladaptive plastic changes in synapse structure and function underlie key aspects of behavioral and mood disorders ranging from addiction to depression, as well as neurodevelopmental diseases like schizophrenia and autism. It is for these reasons that many investigators across a range of neuroscience disciplines study the synapse, and the reason that new tools to study synapse structure and function within neural circuits of interest are sorely needed. Indeed, current tools to assess synapse structure in defined cell types are not readily compatible with state-of-the-art 3D volume approaches such as serial block face scanning electron microscopy, and are severely hampered by inadequate computational tools for quantitative assessment of these massive datasets. However, advances in molecular genetics, optics, engineering and computing provide new opportunities to develop information rich strategies to peer into the synapse. Here, we combine such advances to achieve a new state-of-the-art in imaging and analyzing microcircuit connectivity and synapse structure within neurotransmitter-defined neural networks. Specifically, we leverage the fact that the bulk of signaling across the synapse is mediated by a relatively small population of small molecule neurotransmitters that are synthesized and packaged into synaptic vesicles at the site of release in axonal compartments. The bulk of neurotransmission is thus dependent on just seven well- described vesicular transporters expressed in brain. Our overall goal is to build a rigorous, easily deployable, cell-type-specific, expandable, multi-functional toolkit for imaging and quantifying neurotransmitter-defined synaptic connections by both light and electron microscopy in mice. To accomplish this, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to insert electron microscopy-compatible tags into native vesicular transporters (Aim 1), establish simplified procedures for their monochrome and ‘multicolor’ labeling in 3D ultrastructure (Aim 2), and computational tools for automated segmentation and quantitative analysis of key pre- and post-synaptic metrics (Aim 3). Though these Aims are independently meritorious, by synthesizing them we aim to generate a complete toolkit that will allow investigators to render neurotransmitter-defined circuit connections into 3D ultrastructure datasets with automated quantitative assessment of key features of pre- and post-synaptic structure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synaptic and structural dysfunction are causally related to both the causes and symptoms of neuropsychiatric illness ranging from Alzheimer’s disease to addiction and depression. Modern advances in molecular genetics, engineering, materials, and computer sciences have created new opportunities to understand how brain dysfunction gives rise to disease. Here, we leverage these interdisciplinary advances to develop new probes, new methods, and new analysis pipelines to study the normal and pathological structure and function of synaptically coupled brain cells.",Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning.,9822844,RF1MH120685,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acetylcholine', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chelating Agents', 'Chemicals', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Deposition', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunoelectron Microscopy', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements', 'Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Optics', 'Oxides', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Purines', 'Recycling', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'Vesicle', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Western Blotting', 'addiction', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'light microscopy', 'materials science', 'monoamine', 'nanoscale', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neurotransmission', 'peer', 'polymerization', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'synaptic function', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",RF1,2019,2509965,0.0039973395095216375
"Individualized Closed Loop TMS for Working Memory Enhancement ABSTRACT The proposed project is designed to increase precision and responsiveness in transcranial magnetic stimulation therapies across the neuropsychiatric spectrum and specifically in working memory deficits which are common across a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. Cutting edge functional imaging studies suggest that using multiple types of imaging datasets yield more reliable estimates of brain network communication. Our methods yield a combined resting and task fMRI functional network mapping individualized for each participant that will allow precise identification of brain stimulation targets associated with optimal working memory performance (Aim 1). To close the loop in designing TMS protocols that respond to an individual person's brain activation state, we will also develop and test a real-time brain decoder to determine when optimal working memory states are online (Aim 2). By iteratively testing excitatory neuromodulation frequencies at this stimulation site and capturing the relative movement of brain states towards or away from optimal working memory states, we will settle on the optimal frequency for augmenting working memory performance in each individual (Aim 3). We will validate this approach by administering either the `best' or `worst' (random assignment to each participant) neuromodulation protocol across several days then testing working memory performance and brain activation in a final MRI scan session. The multi-modal based TMS targeting and individualized frequency optimization techniques will be based on our findings and packaged into a combined software suite in Docker containers made available to the scientific and clinical community at the conclusion of this project (Aim 4). NARRATIVE The next generation of brain stimulation therapies for mental health disorders will be more individualized and will use cutting edge neuroscience and brain imaging techniques to guide them.

"Probing human orientation and its neural representation via direct human brain recordings Summary The goal of this project is to understand how different brain regions represent one’s current direction and location to support spatial navigation and memory. Recent decades saw the discovery of several spatial representation patterns in the medial temporal lobe and other deep structures, including spatial cells, such as grid and head-direction cells, and signals in oscillatory power of local field potentials, such as the movement-related theta rhythm and a recent theta band signal for goal proximity to boundaries. We recently developed a new method for identifying detailed navigation-related brain activity typically linked to spatial cells in widespread regions based on large-scale neuronal recordings of field potentials rather than single-cell recordings, bridging the gap between the two types of signals. I used this method to identify hexadirectional modulation patterns of the power of human theta-band (5–8 Hz) field potentials, likely generated by the grid cell network (Maidenbaum et al. 2018, PNAS), and have initial findings of several other similar signals. The grid signal in local field potential has proven to be robust - replicated both by us and by two other independent groups.  In this proposal, we seek to leverage this our new approach for identifying specific directional spatial representations form LFP to interrogate the human neural representation of direction and location across widespread brain regions using electrocorticographic and depth recordings (ECoG/iEEG) from neurosurgical patients who perform our novel Virtual and Augmented Reality tasks. Our proposal examines the neural representation of directional spatial behavior comprehensively. First, we will characterize the neural correlates of several different directionally tuned spatial representations in the oscillatory power of local field potentials (Aim 1), bridging the gap between single-cell recordings and other imaging modalities, and between the wide array of neural results from animal-models to the literature on human behavior and fMRI representations. We will then test the activity of a battery of local field potential based spatial signals, including our new gridness signal, the signals established by Aim 1 (heading direction, vectors to goals, boundarie and objects) and several other existing signals (e.g. goal location, planned path distance). We will characterize their attributes in different scenarios based on models from the extensive ​animal​ literature, and test how they are extended by the differences in perception and higher-cognitive functions of ​humans​ in practical navigation and spatial memory behavioral tasks focused on disorientation and remapping of neural representations (Aim 2). Finally, using novel Augmented Reality (AR) paradigms we will test if behavioral results transfer from virtual environments to augmented tasks in the real world, in which the subject’s proprioceptive, vestibular and locomotion systems are active. We will test the stability of our LFP neural signals in directional paradigms in patients using AR tasks that can be performed from the patient's bed (Aim 3). This proposal will improve our understanding of the brain’s spatial system, support navigation and spatial memory in both people who are healthy or those with spatial deficiencies, and more generally aid in understanding the systems underlying episodic memory deficiencies at large. Narrative How are one’s surroundings represented in the brain, how does this representation differ between humans and animals, and how do these signals actually manifest in human behavior? This proposal explores directional spatial signals in the brain via oscillatory power in the local field potential from intracranial recordings (iEEG / ECoG) during human behavior in virtual and augmented reality bridging results from single-unit recordings, fMRI and behavior.

Answering these questions will improve our understanding of the brain’s spatial system, lead to methods for supporting navigation and spatial memory in people who are healthy or with spatial deficiencies, and more generally help people facing memory deficiencies.",Probing human orientation and its neural representation via direct human brain recordings,9835997,F32MH120990,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Augmented Reality', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disorientation', 'Environment', 'Environment Design', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior test', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information organization', 'neural correlate', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'spatial memory', 'stability testing', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'vector', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,F32,2019,61226,0.032049334239800144
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries.

"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis).

"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,9862969,R01MH121480,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Security Number', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'biological systems', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'density', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'memory recall', 'microstimulation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,479816,0.08035186097804492
"CRCNS: Role of Mossy Cells in Gating Plasticity Hippocampal Granule Cells We propose an international collaborative multidisciplinary research project to investigate neural circuit mechanisms of spatial memory formation in the mammalian brain. In both humans and rodents, the hippocampus is a brain region required to store long-term memories. This process depends on activity- dependent changes in the strengths of connections between neurons, known as synaptic plasticity. In the input layer of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, a principal cell type called the granule cell receives synaptic inputs from cortex carrying information about spatial navigation, and it is thought that synaptic plasticity at these inputs stores a map of space in dentate granule cells. Like most hippocampal and cortical circuits, the dentate gyrus is comprised of multiple neuronal cell types, many of which are inhibitory interneurons. However, the dentate gyrus also contains a unique class of local excitatory interneurons,, called mossy cells, which form local synapses onto granule cells and inhibitory interneurons, but do not project outside the dentate gyrus. It is a major goal of this project to reconcile the direct excitatory and indirect inhibitory influences of mossy cells on granule cells, which could have opposing effects on spatial information processing and memory storage. Recent work has shown that mossy cells are required for the formation of new spatial memories, though the underlying mechanism is completely unknown. Interestingly, the mossy cell inputs and cortical inputs to granule cells segregate onto proximal and distal regions of granule cell dendrites, respectively. In other cell types, synchronous activation of proximal and distal input pathways evokes local dendritic spikes that potently induce synaptic plasticity. However, whether this occurs in granule cells in response to coincidence of feedforward input from cortex and feedback input from mossy cells has not been investigated. Therefore, in order to test the role of mossy cell input in gating dendritic spiking and plasticity in dentate granule cells, we propose to 1) directly record from granule cell dendrites in vitro in response to precisely controlled input patterns, 2) directly image the activity of granule cell dendrites in vivo during spatial navigation while chemogenetically silencing mossy cells, and 3) develop experimentally-constrained computational models of dentate gyrus cells and circuits to investigate how a dedicated feedback neuron type like mossy cells affects the storage and recall of information in a neural circuit. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Humans with temporal lobe epilepsy and traumatic brain injury exhibit specific degeneration of hippocampal mossy cells, and suffer from deficits in memory and cognition. While existing pharmacological treatments reduce seizure frequency and severity in some epileptic patients, no treatments exist for the associated learning and memory disorders. We expect our research to generate new insight and inform the development of new treatment strategies for neural circuit dysfunction. n/a",CRCNS: Role of Mossy Cells in Gating Plasticity Hippocampal Granule Cells,9913880,R01MH121979,"['Affect', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Calcium Spikes', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Learning Disorders', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Supporting Cell', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'granule cell', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'long term memory', 'neural circuit', 'place fields', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'treatment strategy', 'two-photon', 'way finding']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,193888,-0.0002261350930557462
"Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 6.7% to 7.3% of people globally each year and incur a large burden on people’s lives. To address this urgent problem, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the neural bases of subjective experiences in anxiety, including threat perception. Translational neuroscience has focused on animal models of defensive behavior involving a core set of regions. Although these animal models and the human subjects research they inspired have led to advances in treatment of anxiety, the mapping between neural mechanisms and subjective experience remains poorly understood. The set of regions found to support defensive behavior in animal models does not appear to be involved in all instances of fear or anxiety. The current project overcomes this barrier by integrating current models of anxiety with predictive coding models of the mind and brain. Incorporating predictive coding into models of anxiety will offer a better understanding of how neural activity relates to subjective experiences important to anxiety (e.g., threat perception). The project tests two parallel hypotheses about neural representation of threat perception suggested by predictive coding models: that neural representations of threat perception are content-specific (Aim 1) and that neural representations of threat perception depend on expectations (Aim 2). Using a single design, we manipulate content-specificity and expectations to test these two hypotheses in parallel. We use fMRI to measure brain activity and use self-report and peripheral psychophysiology to measure subjective experiences of threat perception. To the extent that participants find stimuli threatening (as indexed by self-report and psychophysiology), we hypothesize that we will observe relatively content-specific neural representations of threat. We also hypothesize that neural representations of threat will differ under conditions of expectation vs. expectancy violation. The effect of expectation may impact content-specific neural activity or activity in a core set of regions. The knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential improve understanding of the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences. Relevant for translational neuroscience, a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety will be critical to closing the gap between laboratory research and more effective treatments for anxiety. More broadly, predictive coding models are models of basic brain function. Thus, the predictive coding model we propose offers a new theoretical framework that is generalizable to psychiatric illnesses involving disordered threat perception (e.g., schizophrenia) and other affective disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder). PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent work suggests that the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety has been over-estimated10-13 and development of new treatments have stalled5-8, in part, because the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences that produce anxiety (e.g., perceiving threats) remains poorly understood. The proposed project addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the neural basis of a subjective experience important anxiety and anxiety disorders (threat perception) using a model of brain function from cognitive neuroscience. In doing so, the proposed project offers a novel theoretical framework that allows for better modeling of the relationship between neural activity and subjective experiences (e.g., threat perception) in anxiety, which has the potential to advance understanding of the mechanisms that drive anxiety and anxiety disorders.",Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework,10068854,F32MH122062,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human Subject Research', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pain processing', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'training project', 'translational neuroscience']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,64926,0.02130009739327521
"Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation Project Abstract/Summary This application describes a 3-year training plan that will enable me, a cognitive neuroscientist with prior training in electroencephalography (EEG), to conduct research on contextual memory representation using neuroimaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. EEG is useful for examining the timing properties of neural activity, but cannot localize activity to specific regions of the brain. In this proposal, I will receive training on a high-spatial resolution neuroimaging technique (fMRI), which will allow me to develop theories of neural function that are constrained by both space and time. I will also build on my prior degree in applied statistics and receive additional training in computational neuroscience, which will enable me to develop computational theories at the macro-circuit level. I will be supervised by Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill, an expert fMRI experimentalist and theorist of lateral prefrontal cortex function, who has extensive experience researching the context-dependent nature of semantic memory. I will be co-supervised by Dr. Anna Schapiro, an expert on statistical learning and computational modeling of the brain. I propose to examine how prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents statistical dependencies among sequentially presented visual and auditory input. I will examine how the temporal extent and level of abstraction of sequential representations changes across ventral PFC. This will connect findings from several literatures, ranging from decision-making to emotion processing and language comprehension, within a single unifying framework. In addition, I will explore whether ‘deep’ or ‘shallow’ recurrent neural networks better capture the sensitivity profile of ventral PFC, informing the question of whether the brain conducts ‘deep’ learning. In Aim 1, I will conduct behavioral piloting and collect data for two neuroimaging experiments on hierarchical sequential processing. I will have participants learn the statistical properties of hierarchically organized sequences of abstract visual (Aim 1a&b) and auditory (Aim 1b) images. I then test for neural sensitivity to statistical learning at each hierarchical level using pattern similarity analysis, comparing the neural response to the sequences before and after learning. In Aim 2, I will conduct computational modeling of the neuroimaging data in Aim 1, with held out data to ensure robustness and reproducibility. I compare the neuroimaging data to internal model representations derived from single-layer (‘shallow’) and multi-layer (‘deep’) recurrent neural networks trained on the same sequences as the humans in Aim 1. By modeling the neural representation of context itself, the current proposal will help fill a critical gap in our understanding of how the brain predicts upcoming sensory input, enabling rapid processing of the world around us. It will also inform our understanding of several psychiatric disorders that involve prefrontal cortex disfunction and disturbances of contextual processing, such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Project Narrative As we navigate the world we are bombarded by a flood of sensations that our brain must rapidly make sense of, and understanding the context we are in as it relates to the likelihood of upcoming experiences is important for enhancing the speed and accuracy of this process. This proposal examines how sensory context is represented in the brain, by having people learn statistical regularities in artificial sequences of images and syllables and modeling neural activity in prefrontal cortex as they are exposed to different sensory “contexts” using fMRI. Through computational modeling of prefrontal cortex, we can enhance our understanding of the function of a brain region implicated in many neuropsychological disorders where the perception of context is distorted or disrupted, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.",Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation,9990118,F32MH123002,"['Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Esthesia', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'interest', 'language comprehension', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sequence learning', 'social', 'sound', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2020,64926,0.035269280896564205
"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,9991327,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73106,0.0715097698305857
"Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction Abstract  One of the high priority research areas listed in the BRAIN 2025 Report is a better understanding of the brain network dynamics across time and space from human electrophysiological recordings. The RFA-MH-20- 120 “BRAIN Initiative: Secondary Analysis and Archiving of BRAIN Initiative Data” specifically focuses on the use of large volumes of existing data stored in open access public databases. In the proposed studies, we will perform an innovative secondary analysis of existing intracranial EEG records from patients with medicine- resistant epilepsy collected during their presurgical evaluation. These records from public repositories would allow us to study dynamic interactions between hippocampal and neocortical structures during the development of pathological activity as well as during verbal memory tasks. We will use a novel and rapidly developing approach from the realm of machine learning algorithms namely, deep learning neural networks. Physiological mechanisms of memory formation and consolidation as well as pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy are poorly understood. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that physiological function and dysfunction of the hippocampal-neocortical system may have a common mechanism that depends on the dynamic interaction of electrophysiological oscillations in the system. Brain oscillations have been suggested to be involved in information transfer within and between brain networks by modulating neural excitability at different spatial and temporal scales. The interaction of oscillations across different time scales is referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ and it represents a high-order structure in the functional organization of brain rhythms. Aberrant patterns of cross-frequency coupling may lead to memory dysfunction as well as facilitate the propagation of pathological activity. At present, the field does not have a mechanistically justified criterion to distinguish between physiological and pathological oscillations especially regarding their high-order interactions. We will study cross- frequency coupling during the interictal-ictal transition (Aim 1) and during successful and unsuccessful verbal memory performance (Aim 2) using Deep Learning algorithms. One of the study goals is to create a neural network capable of recognizing patterns of cross-frequency coupling as biomarkers of different physiological and pathological functional states of the brain. A comprehensive characterization of cross-frequency coupling would allow us to distinguish between physiological and aberrant forms of interaction between brain networks at different time scales. The study results will deepen our knowledge about the functional organization of brain rhythms and will provide a new method to recognize functional states from electrophysiological records of brain activity. This method will be applicable for a more accurate monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of memory impairments in neurological and mental disorders as well as for the development of new tools for seizure prediction and control. Public Health Relevance Statement  A better understanding of brain dynamics from human electrophysiological recordings will help us find new ways to treat neurological and mental disorders and the BRAIN Initiative encourages the secondary analysis of large amounts of existing data. The proposed study will analyze intracranial EEG records from human participants stored in public data repositories using artificial intelligence methods.

"Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo Project Summary Developing new methodological and analytical tools to address currently insurmountable experimental questions is crucial to the future of neuroscience. While recent advances in two-photon microscopy and activity sensors have revolutionized our understanding of the cellular and circuit basis of behavior, many barriers still exist that preclude fully exploring the molecular basis of these processes in vivo. This is an important question, as modulating synaptic strength is thought to underlie higher brain functions such as learning and memory, whereas synaptic degradation is observed in many neurological pathologies. Despite the clear significance of synaptic communication, a large-scale analysis of how synapses across the brain are distributed and change during learning has not been performed, mainly due to technical difficulties arising from the immensely complex nature of synaptic networks. Here, we present a suite of novel methodologies that breaks through these barriers. Our novel approach leverages CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins, in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize fluorescently tagged synapses in behaving animals, and deep-learning-based automatic synapse detection. Using these minimally invasive methods, we will be able to longitudinally track how the strength of millions of individual synapses change during learning. By developing and enabling new strategies to automatically detect and track vast numbers of synapses across entire brain regions, this pioneering approach has the potential to provide us with an unprecedented view of synapses in behaving animals, enabling new discoveries regarding how dynamic regulation of synaptic strength encodes learning and memory. Project Narrative This multi-disciplinary proposal leverages molecular labeling, machine learning, and in vivo microscopy to develop a suite of first-in-class tools to automatically detect synaptic plasticity in intact animals. By employing these novel tools we seek to explain how dynamic modulation of synaptic networks encodes learning and memory. Disruption of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be tightly associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases and the proposed research may reveal novel therapeutic approaches for several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease.",Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo,10009886,RF1MH123212,"['AMPA Receptors', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Investigation', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain volume', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'interest', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'open source', 'postsynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'synaptic function', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1757079,0.03550184397004596
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10067892,F31MH124323,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Critical Thinking', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medial Dorsal Nucleus', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Mind', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Supermarket', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'arm', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'empowered', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'long term memory', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'microendoscope', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'self-directed learning', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social relationships', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,45520,0.07793948327368404
"Anesthestic modulation of human memory during acute pain Project Summary (abstract): Despite routine use of sedative-hypnotic and analgesic agents (anesthetics) to prevent or ease suffering during aversive conditions, the effects of these agents on behavior and the neural systems that form memories, respond to threat, and process pain are poorly understood. This project will determine the memory-modulating effects of propofol, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl in the context of periodic pain stimulation. It is a randomized, placebo- controlled, single-blind, parallel arm fMRI study in healthy adults (under age 40). Subjects will perform a memory encoding task while receiving periodic acute pain stimulation. Explicit and implicit memory will be quantified using response time and physiologic responses, including heart rate and electrodermal activity. Neuroimaging will localize brain activity and connectivity. Psychometric data relevant to pain and anxiety will be used to account for inter-individual differences. The central hypothesis is that, when forming memory during concomitant painful stimulation, three anesthetic agents, with different receptor pharmacology, will have distinct behavioral and physiologic response patterns, which are mediated by different activity within and interactions between the neural systems responsible for memory encoding, threat response, and pain processing. There are three scientific research goals of this patient-oriented career development proposal. The first is to determine how behavioral and physiologic measures of explicit and implicit memory are modulated by pain and the individual effects of the three anesthetics under investigation. The second aim is to determine the brain structures differentially engaged in memory encoding under pain and drug conditions, using task-related functional MRI and functional connectivity analyses. The third aim is to determine brain changes correlated to subject psychometric measures of anxiety, stress, sleep, and pain through multivariate psychophysiological interaction analysis. The scientific framework for this project has a direct application in better understanding the impact of memories formed during sedation with anesthetics while experiencing noxious stimuli. Additionally, further extension of this pharmacologic modulation technique to other cognitive neuroscience paradigms could provide a multidisciplinary framework for basic studies of memory formation, the genesis of dysregulated memories, and the necessary conditions for anesthetic-induced amnesia. In addition to the hands-on research experience of running a trial, achieved through the research aims, this project will advance the applicant into an independent physician scientist in anesthesiology through specific career-development activities. This will be accomplished through a combination of mentoring and evaluation meetings, national scientific/professional meetings, formal didactics, and local seminars/presentations. As part of professional development, coursework in multivariate statistical analysis techniques and cognitive and behavioral neuroscience is planned. The project will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, in the School of Medicine, which has outstanding support for clinical and translational research and an established record of developing physician scientists into independent investigators. Project Narrative: Memories formed during painful conditions can lead to later psychologic problems, such as anxiety. This study will clarify how three distinct anesthetics affect the formation of conscious and subconscious memories during experimental painful stimulation, using a variety of measurements. This multidisciplinary project brings together research techniques from the distinct fields of behavioral psychology, neuroimaging, and anesthetic pharmacology to better understand this phenomenon.",Anesthestic modulation of human memory during acute pain,9892230,K23GM132755,"['Acute Pain', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amnesia', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Attenuated', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Dose', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fentanyl', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Placebos', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Propofol', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Randomized', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sedation procedure', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subconscious', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive task', 'complement C2a', 'conditioning', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'human subject', 'hypnotic', 'imaging study', 'implicit memory', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'memory encoding', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'pain perception', 'pain processing', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sedative']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,189972,-0.16173094355358708
"Defining Novel Cellular Correlates of Protection Against Human Malaria by CyTOF Abstract Malaria remains a great public health challenge that has resisted world-wide control efforts. The malaria parasite's intracellular life-cycle inside red blood cells (RBC) and its ability for antigenic variation have thwarted vaccine development. Immunity to malaria is short-lived and requires constant exposure to the parasite. Naturally acquired immunity is gained by residents in malaria endemic areas, which protects them from severe malaria and reduces the risk of reinfection. All adaptive arms of the immune system, namely T and B cells can contribute to clinical immunity against different stages of the parasite cycle, both in humans and in mouse models of malaria. Passive transfer of serum from clinically immune individual can protect susceptible patients, establishing the importance to antibody responses in protection. Yet, how protective antibody responses are achieved is unknown. Current vaccines against the deadliest form of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), are only partially protective and confer only limited protection over time. This proposal builds on the study of a cohort of African patients that allowed us to capture varied levels of clinical immunity. Using high throughput unsupervised analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma from clinically protected versus susceptible patients, we discovered the presence of an expanded subset of memory CD4+ T cells. Frequencies of these cells also correlated with higher plasma parasite-specific opsonizing Abs. We hypothesize that the memory CD4+ T cells are essential for long-lived immunity against malaria by promoting optimal protective Ab responses.

Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in patients with poorly controlled BP.",HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration,9461180,R43HL140624,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adjudication', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'college', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'success', 'system architecture', 'theories', 'treatment optimization', 'vector']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R43,2018,224090,0.022981857912133353
"Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. Although it is known that the transcription factor TCF-1 is required for memory CD8+ T cell function, the mechanisms through which this protein controls memory T cell fate remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that a mechanism through which TCF-1 controls the development of T cells relates to its unprecedented ability to create the chromatin accessibility landscape of naïve T cells. We found that TCF-1 is selectively enriched at genomic regions that become accessible at the earliest stages of development and is required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements. At the single-cell level, TCF-1 can dictate a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. Moreover, ectopic TCF-1 can directly erase repressive chromatin marks in non-T cells, generating de novo open chromatin and inducing the expression of T cell genes. While our recent data determined the novel role of TCF-1 on the epigenome during T cell development, our findings also raised another critical question: what is the role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells? We hypothesize that TCF-1 in cooperation with transcription factor partners defines the epigenetic landscape of memory T cells. Our new preliminary data further indicate that TCF-1 expression post T cell activation in vitro can lead to gains in chromatin accessibility at pro-memory genes. However, it remains unclear if TCF-1 expression in T cells responding to an infection can create the epigenetic identity of memory T cells. The domains of TCF-1 required for targeting the chromatin and its potential cooperating factors also remain unknown. How TCF-1 dependent changes on the epigenome relate to pro-memory genes needs to be defined. To answer these questions, we will interrogate the effect of TCF-1 and its potential partners on the chromatin state and accessibility of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Using the state-of-the-art tools, we will generate the map of TCF-1 dependent 3D genome organization and define how changes on the epigenome relate to memory genes. We will further translate these findings in vivo exploiting single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and flow cytometry assays. The expected outcome of this proposal is a detailed understanding of the fundamental interaction between TCF-1 and the chromatin in peripheral T cells which can be exploited to devise combination therapies including epigenetic editing to selectively alter T cell fate at will.
