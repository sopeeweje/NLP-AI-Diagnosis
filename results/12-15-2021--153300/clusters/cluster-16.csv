"Adolescent Psychopathology and Alcohol Use Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K02 competitive continuation application proposes to advance understanding of adolescent alcohol use disorders (AUDs) through examination of adult outcomes with innovative statistical techniques for longitudinal data. In Years 6 through 10, the program focus evolves from statistical techniques for categorical variables to techniques based on finite mixture models. The programmatic focus shifts from relationships among adolescent characteristics to adult outcomes. The project will emphasize person-centered statistical strategies to predict adult outcomes among adolescents characterized by substance involvement trajectories, psychopathology latent classes, childhood maltreatment histories, and treatment participation.      With NIAAA and NIDA support, the Pittsburgh Adolescent Alcohol Research Center (PAARC) is completing adult follow-up assessments in adolescents with AUDs and a reference group. The hypotheses consider the confluence of behavioral, cognitive, and affective dysregulation in predicting AUD course, complications, and outcomes. Adult outcomes examined include AUDs, other substance use disorders, psychopathology,) personality disorders, academic achievement, work performance, family status, somatic symptoms, liver injury, and sexually transmitted diseases. Complementary data from the Center for Education and Drug Abuse Research (NIDA P50: PI Tarter, Co-PI Clark), a study of children at risk for alcohol and drug use disorders followed through adolescence into adulthood, will also be utilized. Incorporating categorical variables pertinent to symptom and diagnostic categories, the statistical strategies applied will include multivariate survival analysis, general growth mixture models, and Bayesian instance-based machine learning. These methods will be specifically optimized to construct clinically relevant models applicable to individual patients, serving as the basis for more thorough phenotype description, more effective prevention programs, and individually tailored treatment interventions. n/a",Adolescent Psychopathology and Alcohol Use Disorders,7481099,K02AA000291,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Status', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance at work', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention program', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Spouses', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'adolescent substance use', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'clinically relevant', 'drug abuse education', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'person centered', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'treatment program', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K02,2008,143320,0.06776898713900346

"REACHING HIV THROUGH GONORRHEA--NETWORK APPROACH DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):  In this research project the           Principal Investigator proposes to employ an alternative strategy to early       detection of HIV seropositivity based on the hypothesis that the sexual          networks of gonorrhea and HIV are similar in the United States and India.        If this hypothesis is true, then the yield of HIV seropositivity by ELISA        can be improved by approaching the HIV seropositives through patients            attending sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in India.  The overall      goal of the proposed work is to improve detection of HIV seropositivity and      to suggest locally relevant prevention strategies against AIDS.  To test the     hypothesis, the Investigator proposes work designed as a cross-sectional         study with the following specific aims:                                                                                                                           To map sexual networks of gonorrhea patients by contact tracing, Opa-typing      and geocoding;                                                                                                                                                    To map sexual networks of HIV-positive patients by qualitative and               quantitative techniques;                                                                                                                                          To study network characteristics (balance, clusterability, centrality, core      groups, sociograms and network overlaps) of gonorrhea and HIV networks.                                                                                           The Investigator proposes also to characterize HIV networks qualitatively        (using text searches, narrative method and semantic network techniques)          better to understand perceptions of AIDS and HIV.                                                                                                                 The proposed work will be conducted in the STD clinic, Government Medical        College, Nagpur, India with collaboration from the Department of Infectious      Diseases, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.                                                                                                              The knowledge from this study will be used to suggest locally-relevant           prevention strategies against AIDS.                                               n/a",REACHING HIV THROUGH GONORRHEA--NETWORK APPROACH,2647513,R03TW000969,"['Asians', ' HIV infections', ' India', ' clinical research', ' epidemiology', ' gonorrhea', ' human subject', ' sex partner', ' social support network']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,1998,25200,0.1973832619197547
"CNS Effects of Alcohol:  Cellular Neurobiology Abstract Overall    The  Alcohol  Research  Center  of  The  Scripps  Research  Institute  (TSRI-­ARC)  proposes  to  continue  its  interdisciplinary  program  focused  on  the  theme  of  the  central  nervous  system  effects  of  alcohol.  For  this  renewal  application,  the  TSRI-­ARC  (P60)  will  consist  of  9  components,  including  3  Cores  (Administrative,  Animal  Models  and  Information  Dissemination)  and  5  Research  Projects  (Molecular,  Neurophysiology,  Neurocircuitry, Neurochemistry, and Clinical). The overall hypothesis of the TSRI-­ARC as an integrated whole  is that the central stress systems become activated during the withdrawal/negative affect stage and persist into  protracted  abstinence  (in  the  preoccupation/anticipation  stage),  and  such  neuroadaptive  changes  associated  with  chronic  drinking  also  produce  an  evolving  set  of  neurobehavioral  symptoms  that  include  hypohedonia,  anxiety, irritability, negative affect, hyperarousal, and sleep disturbances, all of which contribute to relapse and  impede  recovery.  The  specific  subhypotheses  are:  1)  The  transition  from  acute  withdrawal  to  protracted  abstinence  includes  compulsive-­like  responding  for  ethanol  and  negative  emotional  behavior  that  involves  changes in interconnected brain areas: the extended amygdala, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior  insula.  2)  The  altered  activity  in  these  circuits  reflects  actions  of  stress-­related  system  including  glucocorticoids,  serotonin,  hypocretin,  and  corticotropin-­releasing  factor.  3)  Cellular  neuroadaptations  are  associated  with  altered  dynamics  of  the  microtubule  cytoskeleton,  which  may  in  turn  mediate  the  structural  remodeling of neuronal dendrites. 4) Novel neurobiological targets identified by the TSRI-­ARC will significantly  attenuate  the  reinstatement  of  compulsive-­like  alcohol  seeking,  excessive  drinking,  and  anxiety-­like  behavior;;  and 5) drug candidates for these targets will be active in a human lab model of protracted abstinence where  they  will  reduce  drinking,  craving,  negative  affect,  and  executive  function  deficits.  We  believe  the  proposed  innovative  approaches  for  testing  these  hypotheses  will  provide  valuable  insight  into  novel  approaches  for  treating alcoholism and relapse in the humans.     The TSRI-­ARC also supports the Center at Large, which includes: 31 R01s, 10 R21s, 3 U01s, 1 U24, 2 R37s,  2  R13s,  and  one  T32  NIAAA  training  grant  associated  with  this  grant.  Members  of  the  Center  at  Large  have  access  to  the  Cores  of  the  TSRI-­ARC,  the  NIAAA  Integrative  Neuroscience  Initiative  on  Alcoholism  (INIA)  Consortia. Training and information dissemination to the San Diego community will be effected by the training

"CNS Effects of Alcohol:  Cellular Neurobiology Abstract Overall    The  Alcohol  Research  Center  of  The  Scripps  Research  Institute  (TSRI-­ARC)  proposes  to  continue  its  interdisciplinary  program  focused  on  the  theme  of  the  central  nervous  system  effects  of  alcohol.  For  this  renewal  application,  the  TSRI-­ARC  (P60)  will  consist  of  9  components,  including  3  Cores  (Administrative,  Animal  Models  and  Information  Dissemination)  and  5  Research  Projects  (Molecular,  Neurophysiology,  Neurocircuitry, Neurochemistry, and Clinical). The overall hypothesis of the TSRI-­ARC as an integrated whole  is that the central stress systems become activated during the withdrawal/negative affect stage and persist into  protracted  abstinence  (in  the  preoccupation/anticipation  stage),  and  such  neuroadaptive  changes  associated  with  chronic  drinking  also  produce  an  evolving  set  of  neurobehavioral  symptoms  that  include  hypohedonia,  anxiety, irritability, negative affect, hyperarousal, and sleep disturbances, all of which contribute to relapse and  impede  recovery.  The  specific  subhypotheses  are:  1)  The  transition  from  acute  withdrawal  to  protracted  abstinence  includes  compulsive-­like  responding  for  ethanol  and  negative  emotional  behavior  that  involves  changes in interconnected brain areas: the extended amygdala, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior  insula.  2)  The  altered  activity  in  these  circuits  reflects  actions  of  stress-­related  system  including  glucocorticoids,  serotonin,  hypocretin,  and  corticotropin-­releasing  factor.  3)  Cellular  neuroadaptations  are  associated  with  altered  dynamics  of  the  microtubule  cytoskeleton,  which  may  in  turn  mediate  the  structural  remodeling of neuronal dendrites. 4) Novel neurobiological targets identified by the TSRI-­ARC will significantly  attenuate  the  reinstatement  of  compulsive-­like  alcohol  seeking,  excessive  drinking,  and  anxiety-­like  behavior;;  and 5) drug candidates for these targets will be active in a human lab model of protracted abstinence where  they  will  reduce  drinking,  craving,  negative  affect,  and  executive  function  deficits.  We  believe  the  proposed  innovative  approaches  for  testing  these  hypotheses  will  provide  valuable  insight  into  novel  approaches  for  treating alcoholism and relapse in the humans.     The TSRI-­ARC also supports the Center at Large, which includes: 31 R01s, 10 R21s, 3 U01s, 1 U24, 2 R37s,  2  R13s,  and  one  T32  NIAAA  training  grant  associated  with  this  grant.  Members  of  the  Center  at  Large  have  access  to  the  Cores  of  the  TSRI-­ARC,  the  NIAAA  Integrative  Neuroscience  Initiative  on  Alcoholism  (INIA)  Consortia. Training and information dissemination to the San Diego community will be effected by the training  opportunities of the Center including a T32 NIAAA training grant and the Information Dissemination Core.  Narrative    This  Center  proposes  to  continue  its  interdisciplinary  program  focused  on  the  theme  of  the  central  nervous  system’s  effects  of  alcohol.  Dysregulation  in  the  brain  stress  system  mediates  the  transition  from  acute  withdrawal to protracted abstinence to promote vulnerability to relapse, and our ARC is designed to translate  our  discoveries  of  preclinical  TSRI-­ARC  studies  for  potential  therapeutic  use  using  proof-­of-­concept  human  laboratory testing. We believe this project will provide valuable insight into novel approaches for understanding  and treating alcoholism in the human population.

"NEW ORLEANS COOP AGREEMENT FOR AIDS CMTY OUTREACH/INTERV This application proposes to conduct a five-year study to monitor HIV risk behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced intervention to combat the spread of HIV infection among targeted populations in New Orleans.  The targeted populations include intravenous drug users (IVDUs), prostitutes who trade sex for drugs or money, crack cocaine users, and the sexual partners of IVDUs, prostitutes, and crack users. All participants in the proposed study will be drawn from ten large public housing projects in New Orleans.  The study will employ a quasi-experimental design in which the ten housing projects will be matched on important characteristics into pairs.  One of each pair of matched projects will be randomly assigned to an experimental (i.e., ""enhanced"") or control (i.e., ""standard"") intervention condition.  The experimental intervention, which builds upon our recent research experience in community outreach to IVDUs, will consist of (a) a CDC approved ""knowledge-based"" intervention protocol provided at our outreach office by trained personnel, (b) additional information on HIV prevention provided at our office, and (c) risk reduction skills-building training provided in six ""onsite"" sessions that will be conducted with participants on their own turf in the housing projects over a 12-week period.  Participants who reside in the five housing projects randomly assigned to the control condition will receive the standard CDC intervention only at our outreach office. After 30 months, the enhanced intervention will be extended to persons drawn from the housing projects in the control condition.  Outcome measures will consist primarily of indicators of HIV risk behavior as measured by NIDA's AIA and AFA.  In addition, we will assess other potentially important outcomes, such as psychological adjustment, readiness for drug treatment, number and length of drug treatment episodes, etc.  Process measures will include assessment of level of treatment implementation and across-condition contamination.  Multi- variate and tabular analyses will be used to assess the initial comparability of participants from the pairs of housing projects, measure the reactivity of the AIA and AFA with the intervention, and evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced intervention.  The evaluation will consider the extent of exposure to the enhanced intervention as well as significant differences between the baseline characteristics of participants from the two conditions in each housing project pair.  n/a",NEW ORLEANS COOP AGREEMENT FOR AIDS CMTY OUTREACH/INTERV,3550439,U01DA007475,"['AIDS /HIV test', ' AIDS education /prevention', ' HIV infections', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior modification', ' community health services', ' cooperative study', ' crack cocaine', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug abuse therapy', ' education evaluation /planning', ' health behavior', ' housing', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' intravenous drug abuse', ' longitudinal human study', ' medical outreach /case finding', ' prostitution', ' sex behavior', ' sex partner', ' social support network']",NIDA,DESIRE NARCOTIC REHABILITATION CENTER,U01,1993,581818,0.11484462499893588

"Mining the Social Web to Monitor Public Health and HIV Risk Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance and monitoring of risk behavior and disease is a top priority of many health-related agencies and organizations, including the UN AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health and epidemiology departments. Identification and localization of changes in risk behaviors and disease can dramatically improve public health outcomes and reduce health-related costs, by providing data on where interventions are needed and how to direct public health efforts. For example, HIV researchers, public health departments, and government organizations, have attempted to identify and monitor HIV risk behavior (e.g., sexual intercourse and illicit drug use) and HIV outbreaks to improve prevention and treatment efforts and curb a growing HIV epidemic. Social media use has been rapidly increasing, and data from these technologies might be leveraged for identification of HIV risk behaviors, such as sexual- and drug-related risk behaviors. Although researchers have developed methods of using social media to monitor HIV and public health behaviors and outcomes, these methods require extensive manual time, technical expertise, and multiple software platforms to process these big data. Advances in technology, including technology infrastructure, data mining, and machine learning approaches, can be leveraged to provide tools that can be used to create a single automated platform for extracting free-text social media conversations, labeling these conversations to identify health risk-related behaviors, and using these labels to monitor disease outbreaks. We propose to create a single automated platform that collects social media (Twitter) data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV risk behaviors; and provides an output that is acceptable for HIV researchers, public health workers, and policymakers to monitor HIV risk behaviors and outcomes. The tools developed from this application will be open source, tailored for use for epidemiologists and public health departments, and will be available for integration with other software tools to improve the effectiveness of public health monitoring systems.

"Culture and HIV Prevention in Cambodia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to study and assess potential associations between two cultural constructs particular to Asian cultures, ""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"" and HIV risk and prevention. This research will be conducted in a highly affected and marginalized population of young at-risk women working in the sex and entertainment industry in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This research aims to: (1) assess the association between ""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"" with HIV infection and other biological markers of HIV risk; (2) determine the association between ""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"" and preventive and risk behaviors including (a) condom use (preventive sexual behavior) (b) use of amphetamine-type substances (drug use), and (c) adherence to a preventive vaccine schedule (HPV vaccine will be offered and studied as a proxy for HIV vaccine in susceptible participants); and (3) generate knowledge regarding the integration of socio-cultural beliefs (""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"") in the design and implementation of HIV prevention programs and HIV prevention research.

"Culture and HIV Prevention in Cambodia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to study and assess potential associations between two cultural constructs particular to Asian cultures, ""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"" and HIV risk and prevention. This research will be conducted in a highly affected and marginalized population of young at-risk women working in the sex and entertainment industry in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This research aims to: (1) assess the association between ""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"" with HIV infection and other biological markers of HIV risk; (2) determine the association between ""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"" and preventive and risk behaviors including (a) condom use (preventive sexual behavior) (b) use of amphetamine-type substances (drug use), and (c) adherence to a preventive vaccine schedule (HPV vaccine will be offered and studied as a proxy for HIV vaccine in susceptible participants); and (3) generate knowledge regarding the integration of socio-cultural beliefs (""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"") in the design and implementation of HIV prevention programs and HIV prevention research. These aims will inform future HIV prevention programs and clinical trials in Cambodian women through the process of integrating across socio-cultural and bio-behavioral domains. The research will be conducted by a multi-disciplinary collaborative prevention research group that includes researchers from: the U.S. at the University of California San Francisco; Australia at the University of New South Wales; the Cambodia National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology, and STDs, and a community-based organization, the Cambodian Women's Development Association. It will be implemented in two phases: 1st, a formative phase during which qualitative and ethnographic data will be collected examining the views of young high-risk women regarding the apriori socio-cultural constructs of harmonious control and fatalism, HIV, risk and protective behaviors, and attitudes toward biomedical prevention technologies. This will be followed by prospective observational study (Phase 2), with clinical and serological assessments for HIV and STI, sexual and drug risk behaviors and measurement of adherence to a preventive vaccine regimen. The research will generate scientific knowledge in a culturally sensitive and appropriate way. Knowledge gained about cultural influences on risk and resilience will be highly relevant to the development of appropriate interventions aimed at reducing HIV among young women in Cambodia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will assess two cultural measures particular to Asian cultures, ""harmonious control"" and ""fatalism"" and their association with HIV infection and HIV related risks (sex and drug use behavior) and preventive behavior, including adherence to a multidose preventive HPV vaccine series, in a highly affected and highly marginalized population of young high-risk women working in the sex and entertainment industry in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

"Developing an artificial intelligence-based mHealth intervention to increase HIV testing in Malaysia Project Summary  HIV testing jumpstarts entry into the HIV prevention and treatment cascade. HIV testing levels, however, are especially low in men who have sex with men (MSM), who increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM in Malaysia has soared to 21.6% nationally, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that ever tested is 70.3%, past- year tested is 40.9%, and only 9.5% were tested more than 1 time per year, despite extraordinary levels of self- reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in Malaysia are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given that there are many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using social-networking apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) may overcome such limitations, but has yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test an AI-chatbot (R21 phase). Findings from the R21 phase will inform a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science trial (R33 phase) to evaluate the efficacy and implementation outcomes of the AI-chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that using artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (My). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (named MyTestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create an mHealth intervention to provide MSM with real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. MyTestBot will provide culturally tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain.",Developing an artificial intelligence-based mHealth intervention to increase HIV testing in Malaysia,10064898,R21TW011663,"['AIDS prevention', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemic', 'Facebook', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hybrids', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysia', 'Malaysian', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Peru', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Same-sex', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Sexual Transmission', 'Social Network', 'South Africa', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'chatbot', 'clinical care', 'computer program', 'cost', 'criminal behavior', 'design', 'experience', 'health management', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk men', 'humiliation', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'next generation', 'overtreatment', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'response', 'same sex behavior', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social stigma', 'sodomy', 'stem', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'treatment as usual', 'web site']",FIC,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,100000,0.21110754403305132
"A PROACTIVE INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM FOR COLLEGE DRINKERS This proposed research will conduct a randomized trials to test an innovative and interactive and proactive secondary prevention program for college students to reduce high risk alcohol behaviors and minimize alcohol related problems. High volume episodic or ""binge"" drinking is a major problem on most college campuses. But most students do not perceive their high risk alcohol behaviors as problematic, and few are prepared to change those behaviors. Effective interventions are needed that can impact on an entire population of students at risk for alcohol problems. Such interventions should be theory based and capable of being delivered at a low cost to large segments of the at-risk population. The proposed study is an evaluation of the efficacy of a computerized expert system intervention designed to reduce alcohol problem behaviors, and is based on the conceptual framework of the Transtheoretical Model. Over the past decade researchers at the University of Rhode Island (URI) have developed and tested self-help prevention interventions using expert system technology that provides individualized feedback on some of the most powerful variables known to influence behavior change. These interactive interventions are matched to an individual's stage of motivational readiness to change, and have demonstrated unprecedented impacts in a series of large scale clinical trials of smoking cessation and other health behaviors. This study focuses on students during a high risk transition period-the freshman and sophomore years, and will target drinkers and second year URI students will be assessed by telephone to determine eligibility. 1,420 subjects are expected to participate. A three group randomized controlled design will a brief intervention condition that provides three report expert system feedback reports with two control conditions; a minimal assessment post-test only control and an assessment only condition. All groups will be assessed at 12, 18 and 24 months. In addition, the intervention and the assessment only control will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Multiple measures of drinking rates, alcohol behaviors, and alcohol-related problems will be the primary outcomes for the efficacy evaluation.

"A STAGE MATCHED ALCOHOL INTERVENTION FOR MANAGED CARE This project addresses important questions of technology transfer by evaluating an innovative secondary prevention program for managed care.  The program will proactively recruit at-risk drinkers and administer a computer-based low intensity motivationally matched individualized cognitive-behavioral intervention.  The study will examine the impact of a brief stage matched intervention, involving periodic assessment and expert system feedback, on high risk alcohol use.  It is designed to test whether the stage matched intervention outperforms periodic assessment alone, whether periodic assessment itself is effective, and whether these results differ by gender.  Although non-dependent at-risk drinkers contribute substantially to the nation's overall burden of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality, many at-risk drinkers do not perceive their alcohol use a problematic, and few are prepared to change those behaviors.  Brief self-help interventions targeted to the individual needs and motivational readiness of at-risk drinkers have great potential to bring about meaningful reduction in harmful drinking.  Over the past decade interactive self-help interventions, based on the Transtheoretical Model of change, have demonstrated important public health impacts in large scale clinical trials of smoking and other health behaviors.  A three group randomized controlled design will compare a brief intervention condition with two control conditions; a minimal assessment post-test only control and an assessment only control condition.  Multiple outcomes and sensitive measures of intermediate variables are used to evaluate the change process. The study will proactively screen the managed care population to identify a gender balanced sample of 1,235 non-dependent ""at risk"" drinkers who would not normally be targeted for intervention.  There is a six month intervention period followed by 3 outcome assessments at 6 month intervals.

"A STAGE MATCHED ALCOHOL INTERVENTION FOR MANAGED CARE This project addresses important questions of technology transfer by evaluating an innovative secondary prevention program for managed care.  The program will proactively recruit at-risk drinkers and administer a computer-based low intensity motivationally matched individualized cognitive-behavioral intervention.  The study will examine the impact of a brief stage matched intervention, involving periodic assessment and expert system feedback, on high risk alcohol use.  It is designed to test whether the stage matched intervention outperforms periodic assessment alone, whether periodic assessment itself is effective, and whether these results differ by gender.  Although non-dependent at-risk drinkers contribute substantially to the nation's overall burden of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality, many at-risk drinkers do not perceive their alcohol use a problematic, and few are prepared to change those behaviors.  Brief self-help interventions targeted to the individual needs and motivational readiness of at-risk drinkers have great potential to bring about meaningful reduction in harmful drinking.  Over the past decade interactive self-help interventions, based on the Transtheoretical Model of change, have demonstrated important public health impacts in large scale clinical trials of smoking and other health behaviors.  A three group randomized controlled design will compare a brief intervention condition with two control conditions; a minimal assessment post-test only control and an assessment only control condition.

"Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM Project Summary Efforts to integrate contact network data with molecular surveillance data provide enormous promise for HIV tracking and intervention. However, the lack of tools to facilitate integrated molecular-social surveillance remains a substantial barrier to progress. For example, most contact network data only contains information on the immediate sexual and drug use partners of a single individual. Yet, the same partners can appear across the contact networks of multiple individuals. Therefore, partners must be matched across contact networks - a process called entity resolution (ER) - in order to provide an accurate view of the overall contact network structure. The process of ER currently requires either substantial resources to manually match individuals or considerable technological expertise in programming to more efficiently match individuals using probabilistic models. Accordingly, this project will 1) develop a machine learning algorithm to match individuals across personal contact networks and validate it using a large existing dataset of young men who have sex with men, and 2) create a graphical user interface to implement the algorithm as an add-on package to an existing tool for network data capture and processing (Network Canvas). The results of this project will provide an open- source and freely available tool that can drastically reduce barriers to matching individuals across contact networks, thereby providing researchers and public health officials with unencumbered access to the underlying structure of drug use and sexual networks, and a potent tool for integrating contact network data with molecular surveillance. Project Narrative Developing an accurate picture of the drug use and sexual contact networks of men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high risk populations can revolutionize the way in which HIV spread is tracked and intervened upon by public health practitioners. However, these data are usually limited to personal networks, which only include immediate sex and drug use partners.

"Self- and Family-Management Intervention in HIV+ Chinese Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 application, in response to PA-11-194 to NINR, is a 3-year mentored patient-oriented research project to develop, adapt and test a self- and family-management intervention targeting HIV+ women in China to improve HIV health outcomes. The PI has extensive training experience at Columbia, University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), and the University of Washington (UW), and research experience in both domestic and international settings. Her long-term career goal is to be an independent and productive investigator in the field of HIV self- and family-management, with particular expertise in designing and implementing culturally sensitive interventions and to develop, test, implement, and evaluate an intervention in self- and family-management tailored to the Asian HIV+ population in the U.S. Training objectives for this award are to (a) gain expertise in qualitative data analysis for network text mining purposes as well as ethnographic evaluation; (b) learn gender, sexuality, and cultural adaptation skills to apply in a culturally sensitive study design; and (c) learn intervention development skills and apply them in developing a behavioral intervention for HIV+ women in China. The training activities designed to accomplish these objectives will include mentored independent study, formal course work, participation in research conferences, and design and implementation of a research project in Beijing to pilot test self- and family-intervention management among HIV+ women. This proposed research project is ambitious but feasible, as it will be coordinated with Dr. Simoni's ongoing work among HIV+ patients in Beijing and builds upon work that the PI has previously conducted with HIV+ women in Shanghai, China. The specific aims of the research project are to: (a) conduct a secondary qualitative analysis of 68 in-depth interviews to further illuminate the sociocultural and family context of HIV+ Chinese women, (b) develop and adapt a theory-driven, culturally sensitive and feasible intervention to improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes of HIV+ Chinese women and their families, and (c) conduct a feasibility, compliance, and acceptability study for a self- and family-management intervention with 10 HIV+ women and their family members. The main goal is to adapt and develop an evidence-based culturally suitable self- and family-management intervention using Grey's self- and family-management framework. This intervention will assist HIV+ women in adjusting to their illness psychologically and socially, while helping them to decrease stress and enhance their level of social support. In the process, these women will also gain the knowledge and skills they need to cope with HIV. The applicant has chosen a seasoned mentor with extensive experience in the proposed research area, and has assembled a team of eminent academic collaborators across the U.S. and in China. Combining the skills and knowledge she has gained in her academic career thus far with the results of the proposed study, the applicant will be well positioned to submit applications as a principal investigator for further research on HIV in China.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will address a critical public health issue by helping HIV+ women throughout China. The study will develop a self- and family-management intervention for HIV+ women in China that will impact the women's disease experience both psychologically and socially.

At the same time, they will gain knowledge and skills needed to cope with HIV.            ",Self- and Family-Management Intervention in HIV+ Chinese Women,8831462,K23NR014107,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'California', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'HIV', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterosexuals', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Route', 'San Francisco', 'Seasons', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self Management', 'Sexuality', 'Shame', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Study Section', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'coping', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'family management', 'improved', 'member', 'patient oriented research', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social stigma', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'symptom management', 'text searching', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'transmission process']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,127715,0.03754118577080425
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus.

"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7678304,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2008,153230,0.04245228609811482

"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7342564,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,359361,0.04245228609811482

"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology.

A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9524807,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,428830,0.05081490919746765

"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques.

"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions.

"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD.

Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7343382,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,740297,0.03542221185363761
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,8121650,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2011,521526,0.06906243058482402

"Help-Seeking for Alcohol Problems: A Prospective Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA; K01) from NIAAA is requested that will facilitate the candidate's development into a productive and independent research scientist in the field of help-seeking and treatment for alcohol problems. Over the course of a 5-year plan, the award will provide the time and resources necessary for the candidate to receive extensive training and mentoring. Specifically, the award will address 5 primary areas of the candidate's career development: l) to gain a solid foundation in alcohol-related help-seeking; 2) to strengthen advanced methodological and statistical skills; 3) to implement a longitudinal study of help-seeking in individuals with alcohol problems (see below); 4) to develop a grant proposal (R01) for a more encompassing study of help-seeking behavior; 5) to foster development in the ethical conduct of research.      The mentors for the MRSDA, Drs. Gerard Connors and Kimberly Walitzer, as well as the consultants, Drs. Jalie Tucker and Bernice Pescosolido, and the statistician, Dr. Tenko Raykov, constitute a strong team that will be fundamental to the candidate's career development during the award period. In addition, the resources at the Research Institute on Addictions provide an ideal environment for developing a career in addictions research, as well as the best possible setting for conducting the research study proposed in this application.      The proposed study will recruit individuals with a range of alcohol problem severity, and will track their help-seeking behavior over a two-year period. The study will assess attitudes and beliefs about alcohol and alcohol treatment as potential predictors of help-seeking for alcohol problems. This study will be the first to examine this constellation of predictors prospectively, which will allow for investigation of decisions to enter treatment as a process, rather than as a single event. In the context of the MRSDA, the proposed study, in combination with advanced training and mentoring, will provide the foundation for a programmatic plan of help-seeking and treatment outcome research. n/a",Help-Seeking for Alcohol Problems: A Prospective Study,7578346,K01AA014865,"['Address', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Belief', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcomes Research', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Perception', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol related consequences', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'drinking', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'help-seeking behavior', 'information gathering', 'problem drinker', 'prospective', 'research study', 'skills', 'social implication', 'text searching', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAAA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,K01,2009,116049,0.10813032129953122

"Alcohol Use: Nonlinearities in Intraindividual Variables    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Alcohol use is a complex and dynamic phenomenon, determined by a multiplicity of factors that possibly interact in a nonlinear manner. There has been very limited research so far exploring the nonlinearities in the etiology of alcohol use. The purpose of the proposed study is to design a nonlinear predictive model of alcohol use and abuse in the general population with the help of implicit and explicit alcohol expectancy measures, as well as self-reports of family history and personality style. The complex and changing relationship of negative expectancies and alcohol use will also be examined with respect to participants' drinking histories and positive alcohol expectancies. The role of implicit expectancies in predicting drinking behavior, over and above explicit questionnaires, in a large (N = 400) community population will also be studied. Participants will complete a reaction time measure of their memory associations to alcohol, as well as other self-report measures of drinking, alcohol expectancies, personality, family history, etc., and a drinking history interview. Long-term data on drinking (3-month follow up) will also be collected.

"Genomic and Metabolomic Responses to Alcohol-induced Liver Damage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Alcohol consumption contributes to 4% of the global disease burden and in the United States is the third leading lifestyle-related cause of death due in part to complications arising from alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD). In addition to obesity, chronic alcohol consumption leads to excessive hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) levels that inhibit ¿-oxidation pathways and ultimately cause liver disease (steatosis, inflammation, hepatomegaly, fibrosis, and cirrhosis). Interestingly, the adverse effects of alcohol on the liver, in humans and in mouse models, appear to be due, in part, to attenuation of the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa). The alcohol-fed Ppara-null mouse serves as an excellent model for ALD observed in humans and underscores the importance of PPARa in protecting against ALD. Additionally, this mouse model has been cited in over 750 publications supporting its significant utility in understanding the role of PPARa. The mechanism of the influence of PPARa will be determined for potential therapeutic intervention strategies on ALD and for the development of biomarkers for early detection of this disease. To this end, the following specific aims were designed: 1) To correlate alcohol-induced liver damage with gene expression and metabolomic biomarkers identified in alcohol-fed Ppara-null mice for the purpose of developing specific ALD biomarkers.; 2) To identify potential epigenetic and post-transcriptional changes associated with decreased PPARa expression in mouse models following alcohol consumption; and 3) To develop toxicogenomic and toxicometabolomic signatures for types of alcohol-induced injury using primary hepatocyte cultures. These aims seek to understand and integrate the histopathological, genomic, and metabolomic alterations associated with ALD for the purpose of developing early biomarkers associated with ALD pathogenesis. Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to alcohol-induced liver damage (ALD) due to the impairment of ¿-oxidation pathways and subsequent development of fatty liver. A key regulator of ¿-oxidation is the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa).

Alcohol-fed mice lacking PPARa develop human-like ALD and in this project will be used to develop biomarkers that are indicative of ALD progression.              n/a",Genomic and Metabolomic Responses to Alcohol-induced Liver Damage,7337769,U01ES016013,"['Abbreviations', 'Adverse effects', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dehydrogenase', 'Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+)', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty Liver', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Invasive', 'Knockout Mice', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'NADH', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Obesity', 'PPAR alpha', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Peroxisome Proliferators', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Toxicogenomics', 'United States', 'Universities', 'alcohol response', 'aldehyde dehydrogenases', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'clinical application', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'oxidation', 'programs', 'promoter', 'toxicant', 'urinary']",NIEHS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,288790,0.06505279187264879
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen].

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",8116049,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,U01,2011,437768,0.06546934728373767

One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7905111,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2010,242494,0.06866792697120883

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period.

"Mechanistic efforts of chronic alcohol on tumor metastasis and survival    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Senior Scientist Award application will provide partial salary support and release time for the candidate to foster the careers of 5 junior investigators whose research interests focus on alcohol research. A specific mentoring plan is provided that is augmented by several institutional resources. The award will also allow the candidate to conduct and expand his research on the role of alcohol in cancer progression, to promote awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer, and to develop collaborative opportunities in these areas. Alcohol abuse is a worldwide problem and is associated with increased incidence of various cancers; however its role in cancer progression is not well understood. The research plan addresses cancer progression and is based on preliminary data that chronic alcohol consumption decreases metastasis of murine melanoma. Interferon gamma (IFN-g) produced by natural killer (NK) and NKT cells and possibly memory T cells is essential to control metastasis of melanoma. Preliminary data indicate that alcohol consumption significantly increases IFN-g producing NKT and T memory cells. Alcohol consuming mice die prematurely even though metastasis is inhibited and the mechanisms associated for this decrease in survival will be investigated. It is hypothesized that the antimetastatic effect of chronic alcohol consumption is due to increased production of IFN-g by NKT and memory T cells. It is further hypothesized that alcohol consumption decreases survival through a combination of effects on altering T cell survival, hypoglycemia, and oxidative stress. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Determine the contributions of NKT cells and T cells to the mechanism by which alcohol consumption inhibits melanoma metastasis 2. Determine the effect of alcohol on metastasis of other animal tumor models. 3. Determine the mechanisms associated with decreased survival of alcohol consuming, melanoma-bearing mice. Alcohol, 20% w/v in the drinking water, will be given to female C57BL/6, NKT knockout, IFN-g knockout, and nude mice to assess the mechanisms associated with inhibition of melanoma metastasis.

"Mechanistic efforts of chronic alcohol on tumor metastasis and survival    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Senior Scientist Award application will provide partial salary support and release time for the candidate to foster the careers of 5 junior investigators whose research interests focus on alcohol research. A specific mentoring plan is provided that is augmented by several institutional resources. The award will also allow the candidate to conduct and expand his research on the role of alcohol in cancer progression, to promote awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer, and to develop collaborative opportunities in these areas. Alcohol abuse is a worldwide problem and is associated with increased incidence of various cancers; however its role in cancer progression is not well understood. The research plan addresses cancer progression and is based on preliminary data that chronic alcohol consumption decreases metastasis of murine melanoma. Interferon gamma (IFN-g) produced by natural killer (NK) and NKT cells and possibly memory T cells is essential to control metastasis of melanoma. Preliminary data indicate that alcohol consumption significantly increases IFN-g producing NKT and T memory cells. Alcohol consuming mice die prematurely even though metastasis is inhibited and the mechanisms associated for this decrease in survival will be investigated. It is hypothesized that the antimetastatic effect of chronic alcohol consumption is due to increased production of IFN-g by NKT and memory T cells. It is further hypothesized that alcohol consumption decreases survival through a combination of effects on altering T cell survival, hypoglycemia, and oxidative stress. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Determine the contributions of NKT cells and T cells to the mechanism by which alcohol consumption inhibits melanoma metastasis 2. Determine the effect of alcohol on metastasis of other animal tumor models. 3. Determine the mechanisms associated with decreased survival of alcohol consuming, melanoma-bearing mice. Alcohol, 20% w/v in the drinking water, will be given to female C57BL/6, NKT knockout, IFN-g knockout, and nude mice to assess the mechanisms associated with inhibition of melanoma metastasis. Experimental and spontaneous metastasis assays also will be used to examine the effects of alcohol on metastasis of prostate and lung cancer.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood.

Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9491654,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Functioning', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotional behavior', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,401739,0.12340238501137209
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost.

"HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af. Am. Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that the risk of contracting HIV is increasing among African American young adults living in the rural South. African American communities in rural Georgia are characterized by chronic unemployment and poverty along with a dearth of health and educational resources. Young adults in these communities face significant barriers to adequate employment and higher education. Many respond to this lack of opportunity and the resulting economic pressure by engaging in high-risk behavior, including substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Although young adults attending higher education have been studied extensively, barriers to obtaining valid samples have prevented empirical research on the risk and protective factors that affect rural African American young adults who do not attend college. The research proposed in this R-21 application addresses the public health need to develop new approaches to obtaining valid samples of hard-to-reach members of populations at risk for HIV and substance use and to identify the protective factors that dissuade them from engaging in high risk behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) test the feasibility of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for obtaining a sample of rural African American young adults age 18-21 who are out of school and living in resource- poor, rural environments, and (2) evaluate a model of the personal, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors that explain high-risk sexual behavior among these young people. RDS is a novel technique that combines ""snowball sampling"" with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for its non-random nature. RDS will be used to obtain a sample of 240 rural African American young adults. Data will be gathered to evaluate a heuristic model that includes the following predictors: socioeconomic and personal stressors; the negative emotions these stressors induce; support and socialization from prosocial adults; intrapersonal protective processes, including a future orientation, self-regulation, emotion regulation, and racial identity; affiliations with risk-taking peers and sexual partners; and antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior, such as behavioral intentions and attitudes toward sexually protective behaviors.           n/a",HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af.

"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics.

"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV - Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care.

"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM).

As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.                ",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,8531534,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2014,344250,0.14664478475379697
"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration.

"Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Alcohol Consumption and Mental Health in Young People PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic, best characterized as a disaster, is unprecedented in its impact on individuals, societies, and the economy. Of special consideration is the effect of the pandemic on the psychological wellbeing and behavior of young people. Here, we propose leveraging the longitudinal, multi-site National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study (2012-2022) to investigate changes in wellbeing and behaviors, with a focus on alcohol use in response to the pandemic, in an established sample of young people including moderate-heavy users and those at risk for alcohol use, and to identify risk and protective factors for distress in response to the pandemic. Using NCANDA, we are able to directly address research objectives of NOSI NOT-OD-20-097 to understand social, behavioral and economic impacts from containment and mitigation efforts implemented to reduce spread of the COVID-19 disease, as well as downstream health impacts including substance use/abuse, and to determine risk and resiliency factors and outcomes. Unlike most research in this area, NCANDA includes neurobiological data critical to complement clinical and self-report data in understanding the complex and dynamic interactions leading up to and following a disaster. Also, with its accelerated longitudinal design and current age of participants spanning 17-28 years old, NCANDA is uniquely powered to disentangle age and pandemic related effects, unlike traditional same-age cohort designs. We propose supplementing the NCANDA project with a brief COVID-19 survey about alcohol use, mood, and other behaviors during the pandemic as well as COVID-19 exposure and pandemic-related distress, administered to participants in June 2020. To track long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey will be re-administered in Winter 2020 and Summer 2021. By embedding this survey, time-linked to the pandemic, within the existing NCANDA dataset, we propose characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use, mental health, and brain in young people (Aim 1) and to evaluate risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 pandemic-related distress (Aim 2). We propose using advanced analytics, including machine learning approaches, to identify a `signature' from the rich information captured by neuroimaging, clinical and self-report data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, that predicts distress versus resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. A machine-learning approach embraces the complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic-related influence and takes advantage of the multi-domains within the NCANDA dataset. The analysis proposed in this supplement will offer valuable longitudinal data in a well-characterized sample of young people who are bridging developmental years into adulthood and that includes those at high risk for, or current heavy users of, alcohol. Such information can be used to guide public health and intervention strategies to benefit vulnerable young populations in the event of future disasters. PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, best characterized as a disaster, is expansive and includes unprecedented effects on the psychological wellbeing and behavior of youth.

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3.

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2.

"Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use has many negative health consequences, including higher risk of mortality. In addition, in 2006, the estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion when the combined costs of lost productivity, health and health care, and crime are considered61. Despite unparalleled advances in technology over the last several decades, the clinical assessment of features and correlates of alcohol use disorders (and psychopathology more generally), still primarily relies on traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires and face-to- face clinical interviews. However, these tried-and-true methods are limited in a number of ways, including total reliance on patients' retrospective self-report, the skill of the clinical interviewer, and the artificial setting of the assessment (te clinic consulting room). The present study proposes to use an innovative methodology, ambulatory assessment (AA) to describe and investigate alcohol use and dependence-related symptomatology (specifically, cue- reactivity/craving), and emotional dysregulation among psychiatric outpatients with disorders characterized by clinical significant emotional dysregulation problems (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or borderline personality disorder) while in their natural environment. This ""real-world"" approach can shed light on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.

"Integrating miRNAs and mRNAs with alcohol eQTLs in two postmortem brain regions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex genetic trait with important biological, behavioral and socioeconomic components. AUD genetic studies have implicated multiple loci; however, with the exception of alcohol metabolizing enzymes, these genetic results are inconclusive. Therefore, integration of human postmortem brain gene expression data with genetic data offers an opportunity to complement these genetic studies to better understand disease etiology. Furthermore, postmortem studies of human alcoholics have shown that transcriptional changes are associated with the disorder. The current expression studies in AUD have exclusively targeted mRNA expression differences, while miRNAs, very important modulators of mRNA expression levels, have been largely unexplored. Of the few miRNA studies in AUD postmortem brains, as well as in animal and cell based models, miRNAs have been shown to be involved in disease etiology.  In this proposal we attempt to complement and expand on earlier expression studies by 1) detecting disease specific miRNA and mRNA expression differences in a larger AUD sample (N=82) than previously assessed, 2) assessing these miRNA and mRNA expression differences within two brain regions (PFC and NAc) with important function in alcohol addiction, 3) determining the specific neuronal and glial contributions to the genome wide expression profile detected in whole brain and, finally, 4) integrating the differential expression profiles with GWAS data of AUD subjects to detect alcohol response eQTLs.

"How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""How cannabis use affects alcohol treatment outcomes"" Introduction: While some suggest that cannabis use is related to increase drinking among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), others have found that cannabis may substitute for alcohol and therefore reduce alcohol consumption among these individuals. However, no study has prospectively examined whether cannabis use is associated with increases or decreases in alcohol use in individuals in treatment for AUD. Primary aims: The primary aims of this study are to examine the effects of changes in cannabis use (i.e., increased vs. decreased use) during AUD treatment on post-treatment (immediately after treatment; one year, three years post-treatment) alcohol use and related problems. We will also investigate potential moderators (e.g., baseline dependence severity, social support) and mediators (e.g., alcohol cravings) of the relationship between cannabis use and AUD treatment outcomes. Preliminary analyses will also examine differences between those who use vs. do not use cannabis. Design: The proposed study is a secondary analysis of the two largest AUD treatment studies undertaken in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH. Methods: Our sample consists of individuals with AUD who use cannabis but are not polysubstance dependent. Analyses will employ novel, highly sophisticated statistical methods, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner. TMLE and Super Learner use machine-learning and cross-validation to control for confounding and reduce bias; these features are particularly important because we are not able to randomize the cannabis use exposure and must control for selection factors. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that increased cannabis use during AUD treatment predicts increased drinking and related problems post- treatment compared to decreased cannabis use. We further hypothesize that high baseline alcohol use severity and low baseline social support worsen the negative effects of cannabis use on alcohol outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of cannabis on alcohol use are mediated by increases in alcohol cravings. Innovation: This study will be the first to 1) quantify the long-term effects of cannabis use among individuals in treatment for AUD; 2) examine moderators of the effects of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes in individuals in treatment for AUD; and 3) assess mechanisms by which cannabis use affects alcohol-related outcomes in these individuals. Results will inform the clinical ambiguity regarding cannabis use and treatment for AUD, which is particularly timely given that the recent decriminalization of cannabis in several US states may increase the frequency or severity of cannabis use in this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study uses advanced statistical methods to better understand how cannabis use among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders affects drinking after treatment.

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9692448,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2019,131850,0.009160840068558551

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy.

"Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The magnitude and cost of alcohol and other drug (AOD) related problems originating in adolescence make it especially vital to monitor these behaviors, identify high-risk groups and evaluate preventive interventions such as policy measures. Adolescent substance use is associated with the four leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $25 billion in direct costs due to medical care and lost time at work annually. Denominator-based health surveillance systems provide population-representative structured data to inform policy and guide clinical and research objectives to address this problem. However, survey timeframes and sampling frames do not support real-time monitoring, robust subgroup investigation, flexible follow up or feedback of health alerts and information to subjects. Harnessing youth engagement with online social media to derive timely information about alcohol use behaviors and problems may accelerate public health awareness and drive targeted responses. The purpose of our project is to develop a new approach to public health surveillance of underage drinking that centers on mining social media communications in Facebook. The approach may: fill gaps in knowledge about risky, stigmatizing or sensitive behaviors; describe subgroups of youth who may not have opportunity/willingness to report about risk behaviors to public health authorities or clinicians; accelerate detection of trends to ""real time""; and, enable evaluation of policy interventions to resolve impacts at greater temporal-social-geographic levels. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 - Derive metrics of underage alcohol consumption from user-generated Facebook data, testing correspondence of social media and traditional surveillance reports at the state level. The approach is to collect text reports from the public profiles of US Facebook users ages 13-20 years, creating alcohol use metrics from these data by parsing, filtering and classifying them using machine learning techniques. The main hypotheses are that (1.a) patterns of underage drinking derived from social media will correlate with traditional surveillance reports and (1.b) vary in relation to seasons/events. Aim 2 - Establish the relationship between validated measures of the alcohol policy environment and measures of youth alcohol consumption obtained from social media. The approach is to ascertain associations among extant, validated alcohol policy scores measured at the state level and social media sourced measures of underage drinking and harms (from Aim 1). The main hypothesis is that social media metrics of underage alcohol use will be associated with alcohol policy at the state level. By utilizing the expertise of an experienced multidisciplinary team and a comprehensive rigorous approach, we anticipate findings that will advance public health methods for monitoring underage drinking and harms and generate a paradigm shift for policy evaluation by enabling real-time investigation of impacts at fine temporal- spatial resolution. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The magnitude of alcohol problems originating in adolescence make it one of the greatest and costliest health problems for this age group. In this work, we will derive and validate metrics of alcohol consumption from information posted on Facebook by underage youth from all 50 US states, and establish the relationship between these social media sourced metrics and surrounding state alcohol policies.

"Ethanol Metabolism in Embryonic Stem Cells ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethanol (EtOH) consumption results in its metabolism to a toxic intermediate, acetaldehyde (AcH). This reactive metabolite is further metabolized to acetate by enzymes in the Aldh superfamily. During times of heavy alcohol consumption, such as during binge drinking episodes, AcH is not efficiently metabolized to acetate and AcH accumulates, leading to cellular damage and some symptoms of alcohol poisoning. While much of EtOH metabolism occurs in the liver, other cell types are increasingly being shown to metabolize EtOH and exhibit sensitivity to the effects of its metabolism. Stem cells are capable of metabolizing EtOH and many stem cell types express high levels of EtOH-metabolizing enzymes. Because of the carcinogenicity and teratogenicity of EtOH, stem cell metabolism is highly relevant to developmental diseases and cancer. Many of the genetic and bioenergetics circuits that typify adult stem cells are also present in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), making them a relevant model for studying the metabolic consequences of EtOH metabolism in stem cells. However, the molecular mechanisms through which EtOH is metabolized in ESCs remain unclear. Compared to the adult liver, ESCs have different expression profiles of Aldh family members, with Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2 all hypothesized to play roles in EtOH metabolism in stem cells. Preliminary data from our laboratory has shown that Aldh1A2 transcripts are increased by administration of 1 µM AcH and Aldh1A1 mRNA levels are decreased by 50 mM and 100 mM EtOH in ESCs. In addition, glycolysis substrates and precursors, and the acylcarnitine transporter SLC22A5 transcripts are increased following treatment of ESCs with EtOH, suggesting changes in energy metabolism. Consequently, we hypothesize that EtOH is metabolized by different Aldh family enzymes in ESCs compared to the adult liver, which leads to different metabolic phenotypes as a result of altered rates of AcH and acetate formation. We will address this hypothesis through a cell culture approach using shRNA technology and untargeted metabolomics. For Aim 1 I will determine which enzymes in the Aldh family metabolize AcH to acetate in ESCs. I will achieve this by knocking down expression of individual Aldh genes using shRNA against Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1A3, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2, and determining the ability of these enzymes to metabolize AcH to acetate once EtOH is added to the cells. In Aim 2 I will determine the metabolic signatures of ESCs following the addition of EtOH using an untargeted metabolomics approach. This will provide a high-throughput approach for identifying novel metabolites, cofactors, and pathways that contribute to EtOH actions in ESCs. Inhibition of Aldh activity using the Aldh inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde and by specific shRNA knockdown against individual Aldh family members shown to metabolize AcH will reveal pathways altered by the production of AcH from EtOH in ESCs.

"Ethanol Metabolism in Embryonic Stem Cells ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethanol (EtOH) consumption results in its metabolism to a toxic intermediate, acetaldehyde (AcH). This reactive metabolite is further metabolized to acetate by enzymes in the Aldh superfamily. During times of heavy alcohol consumption, such as during binge drinking episodes, AcH is not efficiently metabolized to acetate and AcH accumulates, leading to cellular damage and some symptoms of alcohol poisoning. While much of EtOH metabolism occurs in the liver, other cell types are increasingly being shown to metabolize EtOH and exhibit sensitivity to the effects of its metabolism. Stem cells are capable of metabolizing EtOH and many stem cell types express high levels of EtOH-metabolizing enzymes. Because of the carcinogenicity and teratogenicity of EtOH, stem cell metabolism is highly relevant to developmental diseases and cancer. Many of the genetic and bioenergetics circuits that typify adult stem cells are also present in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), making them a relevant model for studying the metabolic consequences of EtOH metabolism in stem cells. However, the molecular mechanisms through which EtOH is metabolized in ESCs remain unclear. Compared to the adult liver, ESCs have different expression profiles of Aldh family members, with Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2 all hypothesized to play roles in EtOH metabolism in stem cells. Preliminary data from our laboratory has shown that Aldh1A2 transcripts are increased by administration of 1 µM AcH and Aldh1A1 mRNA levels are decreased by 50 mM and 100 mM EtOH in ESCs. In addition, glycolysis substrates and precursors, and the acylcarnitine transporter SLC22A5 transcripts are increased following treatment of ESCs with EtOH, suggesting changes in energy metabolism. Consequently, we hypothesize that EtOH is metabolized by different Aldh family enzymes in ESCs compared to the adult liver, which leads to different metabolic phenotypes as a result of altered rates of AcH and acetate formation. We will address this hypothesis through a cell culture approach using shRNA technology and untargeted metabolomics. For Aim 1 I will determine which enzymes in the Aldh family metabolize AcH to acetate in ESCs. I will achieve this by knocking down expression of individual Aldh genes using shRNA against Aldh1A1, Aldh1A2, Aldh1A3, Aldh1B1, and Aldh2, and determining the ability of these enzymes to metabolize AcH to acetate once EtOH is added to the cells. In Aim 2 I will determine the metabolic signatures of ESCs following the addition of EtOH using an untargeted metabolomics approach. This will provide a high-throughput approach for identifying novel metabolites, cofactors, and pathways that contribute to EtOH actions in ESCs. Inhibition of Aldh activity using the Aldh inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde and by specific shRNA knockdown against individual Aldh family members shown to metabolize AcH will reveal pathways altered by the production of AcH from EtOH in ESCs.

"Social Media Interventions to Reduce Alcohol Use among Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite numerous intervention efforts, risky drinking among adolescents and emerging adults remains prevalent, which is concerning given its association with other risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, drinking/driving) and health consequences (e.g., injury, overdose). The integration of alcohol interventions into popular social media platforms is a potentially exciting yet underutilized public health approach. Social media provides frequent interaction with online social networks, increasing exposure to peer influences. The most popular is Facebook, with 90% of adolescents and emerging adults having Facebook accounts that they access at least daily. Unlike traditional static website interventions, a key feature of social media is that content is dynamic, being constantly updated by users. In order to change alcohol use norms and behaviors, critical knowledge gaps in this area are how to capitalize on peer interaction in order to increase user-generated content, and identify intervention content that has the greatest diffusion. Thus, the proposed study will recruit adolescents and emerging adults (ages 16-24) using Facebook ads, and conduct online e-screening, enrolling 850 risky drinkers, who screen positive on the AUDIT-C, in a randomized controlled trial comparing three conditions: 8- week Social Media Intervention + Diffusion Incentives [i.e., gamification in which points earned for diffusion of participant's posts (responses by peer participants) result in monetary incentives]; 8-week Social Media Intervention Only, or 8-week attention placebo e-news control condition. Intervention conditions will involve access to secret Facebook group pages, separate by age group (16-20; 21-24), facilitated by peer e-health coaches, who will post dynamic content primarily focusing on alcohol use, but also addressing other drug use (illicit, non-medical prescription). Outcomes will be measured at 3, 6, and 12 months. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and test the efficacy of intervention conditions compared to the control condition, in reducing risky drinking and alcohol related consequences; 2) compare active intervention conditions on participant engagement and alcohol-related outcomes; and, 3) examine how level of engagement in intervention conditions (i.e., Facebook metrics) and characteristics of intervention engagement (i.e., sentiment analysis) relate to alcohol-related outcomes. In addition, secondary aims are to examine: 1): the efficacy of the interventions, compared to the control condition, on reducing other drug use; 2) gender, age group (16-20; 21- 24), and baseline social network factors as moderators of outcome; and, 3) costs of the interventions to provide data to inform future public health interventions using social media. These innovative design features will provide the critical next step in public health efforts to reduce risky drinking, by capitalizing on social media to harness peer influences and deliver interventions using a familiar platform. Findings from this study could have enormous public health impact by altering the alcohol risk trajectories of adolescents and emerging adults, preventing health consequences as well as the development of alcohol use disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Social media provides frequent interaction with online social networks, increasing exposure to peer influences, which could affect alcohol use in negative or positive ways.

"Social Media Interventions to Reduce Alcohol Use among Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite numerous intervention efforts, risky drinking among adolescents and emerging adults remains prevalent, which is concerning given its association with other risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, drinking/driving) and health consequences (e.g., injury, overdose). The integration of alcohol interventions into popular social media platforms is a potentially exciting yet underutilized public health approach. Social media provides frequent interaction with online social networks, increasing exposure to peer influences. The most popular is Facebook, with 90% of adolescents and emerging adults having Facebook accounts that they access at least daily. Unlike traditional static website interventions, a key feature of social media is that content is dynamic, being constantly updated by users. In order to change alcohol use norms and behaviors, critical knowledge gaps in this area are how to capitalize on peer interaction in order to increase user-generated content, and identify intervention content that has the greatest diffusion. Thus, the proposed study will recruit adolescents and emerging adults (ages 16-24) using Facebook ads, and conduct online e-screening, enrolling 850 risky drinkers, who screen positive on the AUDIT-C, in a randomized controlled trial comparing three conditions: 8- week Social Media Intervention + Diffusion Incentives [i.e., gamification in which points earned for diffusion of participant's posts (responses by peer participants) result in monetary incentives]; 8-week Social Media Intervention Only, or 8-week attention placebo e-news control condition. Intervention conditions will involve access to secret Facebook group pages, separate by age group (16-20; 21-24), facilitated by peer e-health coaches, who will post dynamic content primarily focusing on alcohol use, but also addressing other drug use (illicit, non-medical prescription). Outcomes will be measured at 3, 6, and 12 months. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and test the efficacy of intervention conditions compared to the control condition, in reducing risky drinking and alcohol related consequences; 2) compare active intervention conditions on participant engagement and alcohol-related outcomes; and, 3) examine how level of engagement in intervention conditions (i.e., Facebook metrics) and characteristics of intervention engagement (i.e., sentiment analysis) relate to alcohol-related outcomes. In addition, secondary aims are to examine: 1): the efficacy of the interventions, compared to the control condition, on reducing other drug use; 2) gender, age group (16-20; 21- 24), and baseline social network factors as moderators of outcome; and, 3) costs of the interventions to provide data to inform future public health interventions using social media. These innovative design features will provide the critical next step in public health efforts to reduce risky drinking, by capitalizing on social media to harness peer influences and deliver interventions using a familiar platform. Findings from this study could have enormous public health impact by altering the alcohol risk trajectories of adolescents and emerging adults, preventing health consequences as well as the development of alcohol use disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Social media provides frequent interaction with online social networks, increasing exposure to peer influences, which could affect alcohol use in negative or positive ways.

"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4.

"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy.

"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will test mediation and moderation of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence, among adolescents and their mothers, to probe whether, why, and among whom neighborhood context earlier in life is a cause of alcohol use across 15 years.

"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers.

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals.

The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals.

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated.

Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors.

"A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with significant health and psychosocial consequences. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority (85%-90%) of individuals believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Gait analysis, is one of the most reliable way to determine intoxication in humans. We developed AlcoGait, a smartphone-based alcohol tracking technology that passively infers level of drinking from gait impairment. In the current study, we will continue to refine AlcoGait's machine learning algorithms to passively analyze gait and trunk sway data in order to accurately determine gait impairment associated with elevated BrAC levels, particularly .08 g%. While the use of smartphone technology to conduct gait analysis has been employed with various patient populations, it has yet to be utilized for assessing gait in the context of alcohol intoxication. We will administer alcohol to 250 participants in a laboratory setting. We will collect gait and trunk sway data from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at preset breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels up to the legal limit of .08g%. In Stage 1 (technology preparation), we will program the AlcoGait 2.0 smartphone application to passively gather and export both accelerometer and gyroscope data (gait information) based on the first 10 participants. In Stage 2 (data gathering, analysis and machine learning), the next 190 participants will serve as a “training set,” providing input data for AlcoGait 2.0; these data will allow for the comparison of 4 classifiers types (machine-learning methodologies) that infer BrAC levels associated with impairment, particularly with .08 g%, using gait and trunk sway data. In Stage 3, the best performing classifier as determined using the training set will be programmed into the final AlcoGait 2.0 app and validated with an additional 50 participants completing the alcohol administration laboratory study (“validation set”). AlcoGait 2.0's ability to accurately associate gait impairment with legal intoxication would represent a great advance over other smartphone applications that require the user to manually record and track amount, time, and types of alcohol consumption. With our app's focus on motor impairment, we see our primary users as those who, despite subjective perceptions or counting drinks, are unable to estimate their BrAC accurately but would want to know if they are too impaired to drive. This technology could be used preventively to alert drinkers of impairment and intoxication in real time, mitigating negative consequences. Passive smartphone-based sensing technologies present minimal burden to users and can have ubiquitous impact as smartphones are now widely owned across all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. Project Narrative Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month.

Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Smartphone technology, leveraging the long-studied connection between alcohol intoxication and gait impairment, allows alcohol use self-monitoring to enter a new era.

"Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Over a quarter of primary care patients in the United States can be classified as unhealthy drinkers because their alcohol use conveys a high risk of health and social consequences. Unfortunately, unhealthy drinking is under-recognized in spite of the existence of valid screening tools. Even when unhealthy drinking is recognized, barriers such as provider discomfort, shortage of time, and stigma can inhibit appropriate care.  The objective of this proposal is to develop and test a new product to support detection and management of unhealthy drinking in medical settings. The Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) will improve clinical practice by combining existing proprietary software with two novel components. The first uses modern machine learning techniques and widely available pre-existing patient data (such as routine lab test results) to build an algorithm that will identify patients likely to be unhealthy drinkers. Publicly available national survey data will be used to develop a prediction model that will then be tested with a clinical data set. The second component is a data system (database, mobile app and related software) that interacts with the patient, providing proven behavior change interventions such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback, while simultaneously providing decision support to primary care providers. Iterative software development approaches will be used to create an app with a simple user interface and reporting functions.  PEARRS will provide a sophisticated tool for managing unhealthy alcohol use that will enable better quality of care, treatment outcomes, and cost savings.  AIM 1: To develop an algorithm to identify adults at elevated risk for unhealthy drinking  based on pre-existing objective laboratory tests.  AIM 2: To develop a prototype data system to actively engage patients and providers and  support evidence-based self-guided behavior change.  PEARRS addresses an unmet need for a low-cost method to reduce the clinical, social and financial burden of unhealthy alcohol use and will improve upon the status quo because laboratory markers will be used as screeners instead of self-report measures that are inconsistently used and can provoke resistance. Further, PEARRS will relieve providers of the need to perform a task they feel underprepared and unrewarded for.  The commercial applicability of this technological innovation is high because it is portable and relevant to a broad market of insurers, employers, accountable care organizations (ACOs) and others at risk for the consequences of unhealthy alcohol use. The impact PEARRS will have is substantial because it can overcome known barriers to providing alcohol evaluation and treatment services in general medical settings. PEARRS represents a fundamental shift in how unhealthy drinking is managed in medical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In some people, alcohol consumption can cause or complicate medical problems, accidents, lost productivity and crime. Although effective methods exist to identify unhealthy drinkers and help them reduce their risks, they are not widely used. We propose using routine laboratory data to identify individuals whose drinking may put them at risk for health problems or complications, and a data system with mobile app to offer them evidence-based behavior change interventions.",Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS),9407982,R41AA025297,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol risk reduction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brief intervention', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'demographics', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'population health', 'portability', 'primary care setting', 'productivity loss', 'prototype', 'screening', 'social', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIAAA,"VERMEDX, INC.",R41,2017,150001,0.11857506899719375
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared.

"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals.

": Complex systems analysis of the impact of alcohol on bone in non-human primates PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol’s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism.

"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism.

Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results.

"Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App? Development and Feasibility Testing of a StepAway 'Bot' PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those actually receiving it. Many factors account for this gap, including stigma, treatment availability and affordability, and individuals wanting to solve their problems independently. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically supported face-to-face treatments. This Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system provided a progression through psychoeducational modules and in-the-moment interventions to reduce the likelihood of drinking. In a preliminary 6-week trial study, we contrasted the LBMI-A with a web-based intervention, the Drinker's Checkup (DCU) that was supplemented with bibliotherapy. While alcohol consumption was reduced by >50% in both interventions, only the LBMI-A produced a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent. Greater LBMI-A usage was associated with greater reductions in drinking. A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, has been developed and has been used by individuals downloading it from the iTunes App Store. Our Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not “pushed” to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience. A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent chatbot will be developed in this study that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or needing social support. It could serve as a personal assistant that guides a user through a process of changing their drinking. This project will focus on developing a Step Away chatbot during the first phase of the study. We will also enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface for optimal usability. The second phase will entail performing a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app among a group of problem drinkers. A control condition will consist of a minimal intervention; an assessment-only app. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smartphone-based alcohol interventions hold potential to bridge the wide gap between the number of individuals needing alcohol intervention and those actually receiving it, but more research is needed about their outcome efficacy and the optimal way to engage users in this new type of intervention.

"Using the Lumme system to improve real-time blood alcohol detection PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a critical need to develop non-invasive technologies to monitor blood alcohol levels in real time. Such technology would advance research assessing drinking in the natural environment, clinical platforms intervening in real-time, and justice applications. Currently developed technology, transdermal alcohol sensors (TAS), passively detect alcohol intoxication by continuously testing for alcohol excreted in sweat. While such technology provides continuous monitoring of alcohol consumption, there are several significant shortcomings that limit its utility in research and clinical contexts. Limitations include lack of temporal resolution (i.e., delay between drinking and sweat detection), poor sensitivity of drinking episodes that do not meet binge criteria, and lack of information about drinking topography.  In response to PAR-16-410, we propose to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a TAS device to improve the detection of real-time drinking behavior. The Lumme system combines the use of existing commercial hardware (smartwatch and smartphone) to assess drinking behavior in real time. The Lumme system uses inertial measurement units to record the movement of a person’s arm in three dimensional space with accelerometers and gyroscope contained in a smartwatch. Arm movements associated with drinking are distinctive, and can be accurately captured with a machine learning algorithm. The combined Lumme/TAS system complements one another’s strengths by providing detailed drinking data that can be linked to subsequent increases in blood alcohol content (BAC). The combined system will be able to accurately track drinking variables of interest to researchers and clinicians (e.g., start/end of drinking, length of drinking episode, rate of drinking, activity while drinking, social networks while drinking, location of drinking, and resulting BAC). Additionally, the gesture data can remotely capture low level drinking episodes that are undetected by existing TAS systems. We currently have a funded SBIR from NCI to develop and validate a smoking cessation platform using the Lumme system.  For the current application, we will propose a Phase I study to establish the feasibility and initial validity of using the combined Lumme/TAS system for tracking alcohol use behavior in real time. We plan to video record ad-libitum drinking behavior in heavy drinkers fitted with both a TAS system (BACtrack Skyn) and our Lumme system. The data collected in the clinical setting will act as ground truth which will be used to train our machine learning algorithm that will be sensitive to (i) how drinking gestures may change as blood alcohol levels rise (ii) how gestures may be affected by type of alcohol and the drinking vessel.  To our knowledge, the Lumme system would be the first system to remotely detect drinking gestures using a machine learning algorithm. In addition to improving real-time BAC detection technology the Lumme system could be also developed to deliver just-in-time interventions for problem drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use results in 88,000 annual deaths in the US and has an annual economic burden on $249 billion. We are proposing to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a transdermal alcohol sensor device to improve the detection of real-time drinking behavior in non-clinical settings.",Using the Lumme system to improve real-time blood alcohol detection,9464482,R43AA026492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Big Data', 'Blood', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Economic Burden', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Intervention', 'Justice', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Sweat', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol testing', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'complement system', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NIAAA,"LUMME, INC.",R43,2017,224228,0.13997289994682896
"Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. However, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), estimated to affect ~2-5% of school-aged children in the US, remain difficult to diagnose and to prevent. Our recent work (PMCID 5102408) identified several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in heavy alcohol-consuming pregnant women whose expression levels in the 2nd and 3rd trimester predicted adverse infant outcomes including craniofacial anomalies and neurobehavioral and growth deficits1. Specifically, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models identified 11 elevated plasma miRNAs in mothers whose infants were severely affected by alcohol consumption. Using Random Forest Analysis (RFA), we were further able to use a distinct group of miRNAs to classify infants apparently unaffected by ethanol exposure with affected infants as opposed to alcohol unexposed infants. Aside from their diagnostic value, it is unknown if these Maternal circulating miRNAs associated with Adverse Infant Outcomes (M-circmiRNA-aAIO) contribute to the developmental pathologies of FASD. Bioinformatic analysis suggests these circulating miRNAs potentially regulate important hub genes for STAT3 and ephrin signaling pathways, which are in turn known to control cycles of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) crucial for normal embryogenesis and placental and fetal development. Therefore, my overarching hypothesis is that PAE impairs early development by interfering with the endocrine action of circulating maternal miRNAs on both the placenta and fetus. In my research proposal, using both human cell lines and in vivo mouse models, I will test the hypothesis that pathogenic levels of circulating miRNAs mediate effects of ethanol on placenta and fetus and that they control embryo growth and survival by regulating EMT-like behaviors of key placental and fetal cells. The long-term goals of this project will be to develop interventional strategies that exploit the biology of endocrine circulating miRNAs in mitigating negative outcomes due to PAE and other teratogens. My immediate goals will be to define the role of maternal miRNAs, which predict FASD outcomes, on placental and embryo growth and development. Aim 1: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on trophoblast growth, survival, migration and invasion under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 2: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on embryonic growth, death, and cellular maturation/differentiation under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 3: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on in vivo fetal development and neonatal outcomes. My studies are expected to uncover novel endocrine and pregnancy related functions of FASD-associated maternal systemic miRNAs and may provide novel therapeutic targets and non-invasive modalities to mitigate effects of PAE. Given its translational potential, this project will further my training as a physician-scientist interested in pursuing both clinical duties and research on early developmental disorders. Project Narrative Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. This project seeks to characterize the endocrine function of maternal circulating microRNAs, predictive of adverse infant outcome following PAE, on the developing fetus and placenta. The goal of these studies is to uncover new therapeutic targets which can mitigate the effects of PAE and consequently prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This goal is consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which is to find ways to ‘reduce alcohol-related problems’ by research in ‘prevention and treatment’.",Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9638420,F31AA026505,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Endoderm', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Ethanol', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesoderm', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Pathway', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'base', 'circulating microRNA', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'human female', 'human male', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infant outcome', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neonatal outcome', 'neurobehavioral', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'offspring', 'placental morphology', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'stem cell biology', 'trophoblast', 'undergraduate research']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR,F31,2019,33461,0.05954956125414295
"Identifying Patterns of Cognitive, Motor, and Brain Structural Abnormalities Differentiating Alcohol Use Disorder with and without HIV Infection Comorbidity SUMMARY Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) occurs in the largest segment of individuals in the U.S. who are dependent on a substance. The co-occurrence of AUD in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is high, occurring at twice the rate as occurs in the general population. AUD and HIV infection each are responsible for disruption of brain structural integrity and cognitive and motor impairments, affect some different and some overlapping neural systems, but can also exacerbate the untoward effects on selective systems through synergistic or additive processes. The goal of this research project is to develop novel machine learning methods to differentiate the compounding factors and effects of these two disorders involving brain to improve the mechanistic and dynamic understanding of HIV/AUD comorbidity effects on the brain.  Efficient study of the untoward effects associated with the comorbidity of AUD and HIV on brain morphology requires identifying differences across multiple diagnostic groupings, i.e., healthy controls (CTRL), HIV-negative alcoholics (AUD), HIV-positive without alcohol dependency (HIV), and HIV-positive with alcohol dependency (HIV/AUD). Testing inferences across multiple diagnostic groupings of complex disorders commonly yields inconclusive or conflicting findings when done by conventional, univariate, cross-sectional study designs, which are constructed to model two cohorts at a time and hold ""nuisance"" variables constant with little power to include multiple factors comprising the complexity and dynamism that may well be relevant for distinguishing the primary disorders.  Herein, I propose to develop robust and reliable machine learning technology that can identify patterns from longitudinal MRI data unique to each cohort.

"Identifying Patterns of Cognitive, Motor, and Brain Structural Abnormalities Differentiating Alcohol Use Disorder with and without HIV Infection Comorbidity SUMMARY Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) occurs in the largest segment of individuals in the U.S. who are dependent on a substance. The co-occurrence of AUD in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is high, occurring at twice the rate as occurs in the general population. AUD and HIV infection each are responsible for disruption of brain structural integrity and cognitive and motor impairments, affect some different and some overlapping neural systems, but can also exacerbate the untoward effects on selective systems through synergistic or additive processes. The goal of this research project is to develop novel machine learning methods to differentiate the compounding factors and effects of these two disorders involving brain to improve the mechanistic and dynamic understanding of HIV/AUD comorbidity effects on the brain.  Efficient study of the untoward effects associated with the comorbidity of AUD and HIV on brain morphology requires identifying differences across multiple diagnostic groupings, i.e., healthy controls (CTRL), HIV-negative alcoholics (AUD), HIV-positive without alcohol dependency (HIV), and HIV-positive with alcohol dependency (HIV/AUD). Testing inferences across multiple diagnostic groupings of complex disorders commonly yields inconclusive or conflicting findings when done by conventional, univariate, cross-sectional study designs, which are constructed to model two cohorts at a time and hold ""nuisance"" variables constant with little power to include multiple factors comprising the complexity and dynamism that may well be relevant for distinguishing the primary disorders.  Herein, I propose to develop robust and reliable machine learning technology that can identify patterns from longitudinal MRI data unique to each cohort. This type of data-driven method is able to analyze all data points concurrently and thus provide alternative approaches to conventional methods, which focus on correlating subsets of data guided by expert domain knowledge. I envision that this project will expand my understanding of the neuropsychiatry of AUD and HIV and will also result in extending a mechanistic understanding of neurofactors relevant to HIV/AUD comorbidity.

"Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Early onset of alcohol use during adolescence is associated with increased probability of later alcohol dependence, polydrug abuse, victimization, conduct problems, psychiatric comorbidities, and delayed achievement of adult milestones. Methods that yield rapid, accurate, and reliable predictions of which children and teens are at risk for early onset can improve the targeting of prevention interventions and enable the concentration of resources on the most debilitating and costly cases. One promising and untapped approach to this prediction problem is machine learning (also called “statistical learning,” “data mining,” or “predictive modeling”), a class of techniques arising from statistics, computer science, and engineering that seeks to build data-driven predictive algorithms. These techniques are most noticeably distinguished from “traditional” statistical methods (e.g., ordinary least squares regression) by their extreme emphasis on prediction of future cases, rather than explanation of the current data, and thus they may offer dramatic advantages over traditional approaches to identifying which children and teens will develop early onset alcohol use. This proposal will explore the potential contribution of machine learning methods by directly comparing their predictive performance to that of the traditional approach in a large-scale, multisite longitudinal study of the development of early onset alcohol use (N = 731). If machine learning methods do significantly outperform the traditional approach, future directions might include the development and implementation of machine-learning- based screening methods for real-world use. On the other hand, if machine learning methods do not outperform the traditional approach, this will suggest that at least in the context of the present study (i.e., these predictors, timeline, and outcome), machine learning does not improve the prediction of early onset alcohol use. Analyses will investigate whether the performance of machine learning methods varies across the nature of predictor variables use, the age span covered, and the outcome to be predicted. Thus, the current proposal uses an extant longitudinal dataset to carry out two specific aims: (1) Train five different machine learning algorithms and one traditional algorithm (ordinary logistic regression) for predicting later early onset alcohol use in a subset (70%) of the data. (2) Test these six predictive algorithms on the rest (30%) of the data and directly compare their predictive performance in multiple contexts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prospectively predicting which children and teens are at risk for early onset alcohol use enables targeted implementation of preventive interventions.

"Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented morbidity and mortality. Risk factors like age, obesity, and comorbidity impact the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID- 19 leading to hospital ICU admission and death. Additional risk factors that promote exaggerated immune and inflammatory response to the virus leading to severe disease or death must exist. One such risk factor could be alcohol consumption because: (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States. (2) Patients hospitalized for pneumonia who have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at greater risk for developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (the primary cause of death in COVID-19) than non-AUD patients; and (3) Alcohol negatively impacts function of the immune system and results in an inappropriate response to pathogens (a primary mechanism of severe COVID-19 and ARDS); and (4) Alcohol disrupts the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) and intestinal and lung barriers which can both further promote inflammation and contribute to ARDS. Accordingly, we hypothesize that alcohol misuse is an independent risk factor that increases the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by promoting exaggerated and dysregulated immune- inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. We will leverage our COVID-19 data and biorepository at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which has tested over 22,000 patients (68% minority) with over 6000 patients testing positive, over 1000 hospitalized, over 600 critically ill. Currently, all patients arriving at RUMC are screened for alcohol use with AUDIT. Our COVID-19 biorepository has banked nasopharyngeal swabs, serum/plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine if alcohol use or misuse increases severity of COVID-19 and elucidate interactions with other risk factors. In this cross sectional study, we will use a machine learning classifier to determine if increased alcohol use/misuse are associated with more severe clinical presentation and poorer COVID-19 health outcomes (in 12,000 RUMC, 6000 COVID-19+) patients. Aim 2. Determine the impact of alcohol use and misuse on COVID-19 disease course and the impact of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption. In this longitudinal study, we will conduct longitudinal analysis of alcohol use in 6000 patients positive for COVID-19 to determine: (2a) if alcohol use/misuse is associated with slower recovery from COVID-19-associated symptoms. Aim 3. Determine if alcohol misuse results in exaggerated immune-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and more organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and explore the mechanisms. In this mechanistic Aim, we will compare COVID-19 patients with different disease severity to determine if alcohol misuse is associated with: (3a) altered immune/inflammatory response. (3b) disrupted intestinal barrier integrity. We will use machine learning and other advanced informatics approaches to investigate these Aims to discover new mechanisms for alcohol-COVID-19 interactions for prevention and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed and threatens our society. However we know very little about the underlying mechanisms and comorbidities that cause severe symptoms in some COVID-19 patients. Alcohol use has been shown to make the flu and other respiratory diseases worse and we think this may be true for COVID-19 and alcohol as well. This study will investigate if alcohol use makes COVID-19 worse and how. Identifying this new information about COVID-19 pathology and a role for alcohol could support new recommendations from physicians regarding alcohol and new targets for COVID-19 patient therapies.",Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19,10163399,R24AA026801,"['2019-nCoV', '3-nitrotyrosine', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Critical Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Emergency department visit', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Ethanol toxicity', 'Evaluation', 'Fever Chills', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Smell Perception', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taste Perception', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States', 'Virus', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol response', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'circadian', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'flu', 'gut microbiome', 'immune system function', 'intestinal barrier', 'learning classifier', 'lifestyle factors', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'resilience', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'soluble RAGE', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue injury', 'zonulin']",NIAAA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2020,313862,0.14917785117310814
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9969289,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,530736,0.008435079731150527

An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9576322,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,237359,0.008435079731150527
"Adolescent Markers of Depression and the Impact of Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY  This K23 award will allow Dr. Meruelo to become an expert on the relationship between adolescent alcohol use and depression. During his training, he proposes to address that untreated alcohol use disorder and depression lead to poor health outcomes ultimately affecting both quality and quantity of life. Dr. Meruelo plans to use an innovative approach and multiple imaging techniques of the NCANDA consortium in a longitudinal study to identify brain features that address the temporal relationship between these two comorbid disorders. Identifying risk factors is of critical importance to anticipating which individuals would benefit from earlier interventions and treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality directly. The award will provide him the support needed to develop expertise in four areas: (1) adolescent alcohol use and major depression, (2) neuroimaging and brain development, (3) advanced statistics, and (4) execution of longitudinal studies.  To achieve the K23's goals, Dr. Meruelo has assembled an expert multidisciplinary team. Drs Tapert and Brown will facilitate guidance and access to the activities of and data from a longitudinal study conducted by the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) to address one of NIAAA's major initiatives. They will also provide expertise in adolescent alcohol use and comorbid depression and on planning, recruiting, and implementing longitudinal study designs with adolescents, as well as career and mentorship on the responsible conduct of research. Dr. Schuckit will provide expertise on comorbidity between alcohol and depression and other career development skills. Dr. Thomas will provide hands-on training in advanced longitudinal analyses of associated data.  NCANDA data is already available to begin addressing central questions of the proposal. At Year 1 or 2, clinically significant depression has been identified in 61 participants after a healthy prior year following a non- depressed baseline. Also identified are those using moderate or heavy alcohol use at baseline, year 1, and year 2 of the study in 164, 223 and 283 participants, respectively. Year 3 data will be available January 2018.  The K23 research specific aims are: (Aim 1) to identify whether any adolescent alcohol use is more likely to lead to long-term depression, or if long-term depression is seen more often after subsequent increases in alcohol use, or both, using latent difference score models to distinguish cause and effect. The common factor of stress and subsequent depression and/or substance use is critical to understanding their impact on growing adolescents, and (Aim 2) to identify morphometrics that predict the development of depression in healthy adolescents using: (a) Naïve Bayesian classifier, and (b) principal component analysis with subsequent hierarchical linear regression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Twenty percent of teens suffer from depression before reaching adulthood and up to half of those also are engaged in using alcohol. This project will establish how the development of depression and alcohol use are related, in addition to ways to predict the onset of depression in healthy adolescents. By identifying temporal precedence in the relationship between alcohol use and depression, and predictors of when depression is more likely to occur, we will be in a position to improve treatment of those likely to suffer from depression and struggle with control over alcohol use, reducing costs and improving quality of life for patients, our health system, and society.",Adolescent Markers of Depression and the Impact of Alcohol Use,9936109,K23AA026869,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'corpus callosum body', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral ventricle', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'skill acquisition', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'thalamocortical tract', 'underage drinking', 'white matter']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2020,204109,0.05326359409251164

"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,9973396,R01AA026879,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Models', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vehicle crash', 'Violence', 'adaptive intervention', 'alcohol behavior', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'bench to bedside', 'binge drinking', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'economic cost', 'emotion regulation', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'social', 'social group', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,606423,0.11113666874497806
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior.

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy.

"1-D Titania Nanostructure Based Wearable Alcohol Sensor with Tunable Sensitivity and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an artificially intelligent alcohol sensor that is wearable, non- invasive, smart, and aesthetic. The aim, in Phase I, is to design and develop the alcohol sensor based on metal (i.e., Cobalt) functionalized Titanium nanotubes (TiNT) to detect, monitor, and display blood alcohol levels in real-time using microcontrollers-based wrist-band like devices. At the core of our innovation, we have Cobalt- functionalized TiNT sensors which are capable of detecting alcohol exposure from the skin in 1ppm level that can be tuned down to 1ppb level as well (i.e., sensitivity of the sensor is tunable). The control unit of our system is reusable, sensors are replaceable, the microcontrollers are equipped with a micro-SD card for personal-data storage, and the proposed unit has a built-in wireless system for data transmission. This proposal also aims, in Phase II, to create an integrated artificially intelligent (AI) network that will have the capabilities of (a) translating the real-time data into a pre-cautious safety signals that will communicate with the personal vehicle safety features through a wireless signal (i.e., Bluetooth), and (c) adaptively taking unattended decisions-on-demand (DoD) through machine learning when the driver is heavily intoxicated. 1 Project Narrative Breath-analyzers within the law enforcement settings alone cannot tackle the problems associated with alcohol consumptions and abuse. Recently developed wearable alcohol sensor technologies mostly rely on wet-electrochemical environments around the skin. Therefore, we propose to develop wearable alcohol sensor using titania nanotube which will be dry, non- invasive, artificially intelligent, and aesthetic.

"A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake Heavy alcohol use is common, yet avoidable cause of death, disability and human suffering. These adverse outcomes are potentially avoidable if heavy alcohol use is spotted early. However, current screening methods for chronic alcohol consumption capture alcohol usage only in the hours prior to testing or rely on insensitive, non-specific protein assays. In a recent highly successful Phase II project, using DNA from whole blood, we demonstrated that a combination of just two methylation sensitive droplet digital PCR (MSddPCR) assays could quite accurately identify subjects with recent heavy alcohol consumption. Since then, we have continued to advance those findings and have developed additional, even more powerful MSddPCR assays and refined our processes to only require the DNA found in a single drop of blood. In conjunction with our ethics and marketing team, we are now in the process of rolling this product nationwide.  However, a significant barrier to a more universal implementation of this disruptive technology is the requirement for blood. Conceivably, a test that could use the DNA from saliva could circumvent patient concerns about the discomfort of a needle or lancet stick. In addition, it would enable both non-medically oriented alcohol treatment programs and telemedicine oriented treatment programs to more easily assess client response to treatment. This will be particularly critical for treatment of alcoholism in the elderly, who are often unable or unwilling to travel to alcohol treatment facilities.  In this Phase I proposal, we intend to take the next steps to the creation of a saliva DNA screening test for heavy alcohol consumption. Already, we have collected and prepared saliva DNA on 150 subjects recently admitted to alcohol treatment and 150 age, gender and ethnicity matched controls. In addition, we have also developed an MSddPCR assay that can adjust for cellular heterogeneity in the saliva DNA.  In this application, we will use these resources to whether MSddPCR assessments of saliva DNA can also be used to detect heavy alcohol consumption. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine methylation status at 4 CpG loci with high predictive power for detecting alcohol consumption and one locus whose information content can be used to correct for cellular admixture in saliva. Then, in Aim 2, we will conduct a series of quality assessment of the saliva DNA. Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze the data from our 4 highly predictive loci, correcting when necessary for cellular admixture, to determine an algorithm capable of predicting heavy alcohol use status. In addition, we will analyze the quality control measures to identify those saliva DNA samples which give unreliable. As a result of this project, we will produce a set of MSddPCR assays and a quality control metric for a rigorous multisite Phase II test of this “bloodless” NextGen product. Narrative Current diagnostic approaches for the assessment of heavy alcohol use normally use blood. However, many patients do not like to have their blood drawn or are cared for in a healthcare setting in which blood cannot be obtained. In this project, we will adapt our recently discovered DNA methylation based techniques to see if they can use saliva DNA instead of whole blood DNA.",A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake,9680049,R43AA027423,"['Abstinence', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Gender', 'Gene Dosage', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intellectual Property', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Needles', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'RNase P', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Transportation', 'Travel', 'Whole Blood', 'adverse outcome', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'digital', 'disability', 'health care settings', 'human DNA', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation', 'phase 2 testing', 'product development', 'screening', 'social', 'technology validation', 'treatment program', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,"BEHAVIORAL DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,223260,0.08083673608540734
"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research.

"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way.

"Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking Project Summary  Although alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects a large segment of American adults and the current treatments are unsuccessful in a significant proportion of patients. Studying the neural underpinnings of AUD has the potential for uncovering target for developing novel treatments. There is mounting evidence that AUD is correlated with dysregulated synchrony within the corticostriatal network. Neuromodulatory therapies, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), have been successful at treating other disorders, like Parkinson's disease, characterized by network dysregulation. Although, DBS has also shown the potential to treat AUD in pre- clinical models and clinical studies, the variable response to treatment (~50% of subject) limits the clinical adoption of these techniques. If we are able to uncover which measures of corticostriatal synchrony are implicated in the therapeutic effects of DBS, then we could target those features to increase response rates and open the door to a new therapeutic approach to AUD.  The short-term objective of this research is to uncover the synchrony measure indicative of successful DBS treatment of AUD and then improve outcomes by targeting that measure with a novel DBS approach. The longer-term objective is to develop a novel treatment modality—dual-site DBS—which could be used to target dysregulated synchrony between two brain regions by targeting both of those regions. To achieve both of these objectives, (Aim 1) I will use a rodent model of alcohol drinking and an unbiased computational approach to determine what corticostriatal synchrony measure best correlates with successful single-site DBS. Next (Aim 2a), I will determine if dual-site DBS can be optimized to selectively modulate the measure previously associated with alcohol drinking. Last, (Aim 2b) I will test the ability of dual-site DBS to alter both synchrony and drinking behavior compared to single-site DBS.  These aims will not only provide a brain network-based biomarker of successful AUD treatment, but also begin the development of an innovative treatment. To complete these aims I will work with my mentorship team at Dartmouth College on the use of animal models of alcohol use, the analysis of local field potentials, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms. Dartmouth College not only provides cutting-edge facilities which I will use to complete this research, but also has dedicated centers for professional development like the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, which I will use over the next two years. Altogether, the training I will receive under this F31 will be integral in my pursuit of a pre-clinical research career. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 15 million adults in the United States with a particular need for new therapeutic options in the treatment resistant population. Brain network dysregulation is implicated in AUD, specifically dysregulated corticostriatal synchrony, and this proposal will uncover the relationship between corticostriatal synchrony induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS) and reduced alcohol drinking in an animal model. Further, this proposal will determine if a novel application of DBS is able to reduce alcohol drinking more than standard DBS by manipulating this dysregulated synchrony.",Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking,9854732,F31AA027441,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Network-based', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rewards', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pedagogy', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'symposium', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,F31,2019,45016,0.13288340023267362
"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life.

"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches",9891764,K23AA027577,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Coping Behavior', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Notification', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stress', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'classification algorithm', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deter alcohol use', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'fitness', 'health application', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'model building', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relapse risk', 'skills', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'stress management', 'stress reactivity', 'stress state', 'stressor', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'time use', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,184140,0.07644613025039475
"Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer ABSTRACT A contribution of alcohol to the development of several cancers, including esophageal, laryngeal, lung, breast (in women) and colorectal (especially in men), is becoming increasingly evident. Each year, 390,000 cases of cancer world-wide are attributable to alcohol consumption, representing 3.6% of all newly diagnosed cancers. The International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer (ICAC) was established in 2010 to complement the major research conferences in cancer (e.g. AACR) and alcohol (e.g., RSA, ISBRA, ESBRA) which do not have a focus on the role of alcohol in carcinogenesis. After the success of the first three meetings (in Heidelberg, Germany in 2011; Breckenridge, USA in 2013; and Crete, Greece in 2015), we are now in the process of organizing our fourth conference. The conferences have been successful in bringing together over fifty investigators (from sixteen nations) with cutting-edge and complementary expertise in alcohol and cancer. In addition to allowing experts to share their most current results, the conference has promoted interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In so doing, it has fostered the development of valuable new collaborations that promote major advances in the field. An important secondary function of this conference is to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research. This R13 application seeks mostly travel support for new investigators, and pre- and post-doctoral trainees to allow attendance at the fourth ICAC to be held in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, on April 14-18, 2019. The conference will remain faithful to and build upon the previous conferences by achieving the following specific aims: i) provide a venue for the presentation of cutting-edge research in the field of alcohol and cancer; ii) promote the development of new ideas and research directions by fostering interactions and collaborations between researchers from a variety of sub-specialties and disciplines; iii) foster interactions between young investigators (including postgraduate and graduate students) and established investigators; iv) facilitate distribution of new scientific and translational information to the professional and lay communities, and v) disseminate the findings of the meeting to a wider audience by publishing the presentations. It is anticipated that these conferences will continue to enhance our understanding of the role played by alcohol in carcinogenesis and thereby facilitate the development of treatments that will prevent or treat cancers caused by alcohol. PROJECT NARRATIVE The contribution of alcohol to the development of a variety of cancers is becoming increasingly evident. The proposed meeting will focus on recent advances in epidemiology, molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis, and the emerging areas of systems approaches, big data, deep learning and artificial intelligence. As has been the case previously, this meeting will function as an ideal platform for promoting interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, it will serve to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research.",Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer,9771126,R13AA027725,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crete', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Endocrinologist', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal', 'Fostering', 'Germany', 'Greece', 'Inflammation', 'International', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oral', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rhode Island', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Travel', 'Woman', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'deep learning', 'graduate student', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'men', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'prevent', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy development']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,30000,0.12718845022798594
"Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers Summary:  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Many individuals engaging in excessive alcohol consumption do not make it to treatment until it has had large, sometimes catastrophic, negative effects on their life. Mobile phone apps and social media, with care taken for consent and privacy, offer an avenue for large-scale behavior-based study within an ecological context. This proposal seeks to develop techniques for the study of and prediction of unhealthy alcohol consumption within the real-world context of the restaurant industry, a population where excessive alcohol consumption is highly prevalent. Using innovative and rigorous data science techniques, we will study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) two types of empathy: depleting and beneficial. In the process we will: (1) build a large and secure registry of digital mobile data (N = 5,925) about drinking behavior, (2) evaluate existing data-driven assessments of psychological states, (3) use machine learning to improve assessments of psychological states and predict future drinking behavior, and (4) perform one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking. Our specific aims include: (1) Automatically assess the association of unhealthy alcohol consumption with affect, stress, and empathy among restaurant industry workers based on their linguistic behavior in social media and text messaging; (2) Develop a mobile app for longitudinal collection of fine-grained daily psychological health to analyze relation to and build prospective predictive models of daily drinking patterns; (3) Examine community affect, stress, empathy, and open-vocabulary factors, as represented by millions of local posts on public social media and assess their relationship to individual drinking behavior for restaurant industry workers. Each aim includes both the development of computational research tools and the testing of specific hypotheses. Constructs range from those with an extensive literature with respect to unhealthy drinking (emotional states), to those with burgeoning and conflicting research (stress), to those that are highly novel (empathy). We have extensive experience in collecting data and developing apps, including preliminary work at recruiting bartenders and servers. Related research and our preliminary work already suggests that there are strong links between unhealthy drinking and digital language data. We will release our software tools -- the app platform and predictive models -- under open source licenses accompanied with instructional tutorials. We see this work as trail-blazing a broad use-case for data scientific language-based assessments to study unhealthy drinking. Narrative  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is ecological, embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Focused on bartenders and servers, an at risk population, we will use innovative and rigorous data science techniques over mobile and social media data to study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) empathy. We further use machine learning to improve language-based assessments of psychological states and predictive models for future drinking, ultimately performing one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking.",Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers,9866472,R01AA028032,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consent', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Employee', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Restaurants', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'alcohol availability', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'social', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAAA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,638572,0.08946894032828336
"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,9906637,F32AA028148,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Ethanol', 'Expression Profiling', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Marble', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pergolide', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Schizophrenia', 'Specimen', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Tail Suspension', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Whole Blood', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol use disorder', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain tissue', 'clinical development', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'drug candidate', 'forced swim test', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'negative affect', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'problem drinker', 'random forest', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vapor']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2019,61226,0.09947767812619487
"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes. Accurate and early identification of patients is needed to implement critical pre-operative alcohol interventions.",Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery,9953526,R21AA028315,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Assisted', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Surgical complication', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'alcohol abstinence', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'direct application', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phosphatidylethanol', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,199125,0.08667832128191748
"Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidation of Leukocyte and Macrophage Biomarker Signatures from Drugs of Abuse Project Summary/Abstract. Drugs of abuse are metabolized by the cells of the body including macrophages and leukocytes. Macrophages are primarily responsible for the detection, phagocytosis and digestion of toxins in the bloodstream and peripheral tissues. Normal cellular metabolism of macrophages and other cells are permanently affected by the presence of toxins in the blood which may include illicit substances such as cocaine and alcohol. We propose to study macrophages and other blood cells from normal and cocaine addicted rats and mice in automated, high-throughput biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS) coupled to ion mobility mass spectrometers and obtain comprehensive measurements of metabolic precursors, products and signaling molecules in real time. We will analyze the wide-spectrum of temporally varying biochemical signature of the living cells before and during exposure to precise doses of cocaine and alcohol administered to cells in the traps using automatic inference of mathematical models. We hypothesize that the resulting metabolic models and biochemical signatures from the cells of addicted animals and normal animals will differ significantly due to permanent alterations in cell physiology brought about by prior exposure. Passive observations and those made during simple interventions can tell much about the response of the cells to a drug or toxin, but the specification of many of the interlocking and nonlinear control systems of individual cells is hidden by the very nature of closed-loop control and requires experiments that measure very large numbers of variables. The automated inference presents daunting challenges that cannot be addressed by a single discipline and hence signifies an exciting frontier for interdisciplinary research. A group of biomedical, chemical and computer engineers, chem- ists, molecular biologists and physicists at Vanderbilt, Cornell, Duke and CFD Research Corporation, propose to merge their talents and optimize computer-controlled nanoliter bioreactors that would use optical, electrical, and electrochemical sensors, two-dimensional mass spectrometry, and novel computer algorithms to design and conduct experiments on small populations of living cells. The goal of this work is to automatically infer the underlying nonlinear dynamical equations governing the behavior of the cells and their environment in the presence and absence of cocaine and alcohol. We will address this challenge by applying Cornell's Symbolic Regression and Exploration-Estimation Algorithms that use in silico coevolution of both the model and tests of the model to experimentally determine which conditions are best suited for further evolution. Our suite of micro- fabricated BioMEMS nanobioreactors, dynamic sensors, and cellular control technologies ensures that we will have adequate dynamical data to create sophisticated metabolic and signaling models of macrophages and leukocytes. This research will have a unique and remarkable educational, intellectual, medical and societal value. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will impact public health by more accurately characterizing drug abuse and the history of drug abuse in individuals so as to tailor methods of intervention and treatment strategies on a case-by-case basis, thereby increasing the effectiveness of assisting addicted individuals in relinquishing drug-seeking behavior. This approach aims to decrease long-term medical costs associated with prolonged drug and alcohol abuse using a novel approach in the identification of off target leukocyte and macrophage biomarker signatures for rapid and reliable diagnostics of drug use/abuse history. The technology developed will be utilized to gain further understanding of the underlying biological pathways that control addictive behav- ior, which is the first step to addressing destructive behavior on the personal level.           Project Narrative.

"Baltimore Oral Epidemiology, Disease Effects, and HIV Evaluation Study (BEEHIVE) Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the life expectancy of persons living with HIV (PLWH) has steadily increased in the United States. PLWH are now more likely to develop co-morbid age-related non- communicable diseases (NCDs) than are similarly-aged HIV-uninfected persons, and the morbidity and mortality of NCD and age-related conditions is paramount. The age-adjusted rates of multiple NCDs are higher among PLWH than among persons who are HIV negative. In addition, PLWH experience higher prevalence and severity of oral diseases, particularly related to the periodontium, although the factors that explain these disparities remain unclear. For example, is HIV-related immune suppression or viremia primarily responsible for these differences? Are lifestyle factors and access to dental care important determinants? Is the microbiome signature in PLWH unique and does it change over time? Since 1988, the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study has successfully followed a lower-income, predominantly African American population of HIV-infected and at-risk persons with a history of injecting drugs (PWID) in a community-based cohort in Baltimore. Over three decades, ALIVE has characterized risk factors of incident HIV and progression to AIDS or death, described patterns of risk behaviors, identified barriers to optimal HIV care, and provided important insights into the natural and treated course of HIV among PWID. In recent years, ALIVE has transitioned to exploring the impact of aging with HIV, focusing on phenotypes and organ-specific non-communicable diseases (NCD) (e.g., liver, lung, cardiovascular, bone, kidney, neurocognitive and metabolic NCDs). The proposed project leverages the ALIVE platform to focus on the combined effects of HIV and NCDs on oral health at the health care-seeking, clinical, and microbiological levels. The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) determine to what extent HIV status influences access to and utilization of oral health care services; 2) determine to what extent HIV status affects self-reported and clinical oral health status; 3) determine to what extent HIV status influences the progression of periodontitis; and 4) determine to what extent HIV status impacts the periodontitis-associated oral microbiome signature. The first three specific aims include sub-aims that define the extent to which comorbid NCDs act as effect modifiers. For specific aim 4, one sub-aim describes the extent to which HIV influences the oral microbiome and a second sub-aim defines how longitudinal changes in the oral microbiome signature affect periodontitis progression. To achieve these aims, we build upon biannual ALIVE study visits with interview, clinical examination, and biospecimen components, supplemented by medical record review and registry linkages. The key impact of these aims is to illuminate social and individual-level mechanisms, identify modifiable risk factors, and produce novel insights to inform efficient and targeted oral health interventions for PLWH in Baltimore and nationally. People living with HIV are more likely to experience chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease and are more likely to develop oral diseases than people who are HIV negative. There are many possible explanations for these disparities, including lifestyle choices and the way the body responds to HIV infection and treatments. This study will identify which explanations are most relevant so that oral health-related illness and disability for people living with HIV can be reduced in the future.","Baltimore Oral Epidemiology, Disease Effects, and HIV Evaluation Study (BEEHIVE)",9985345,R01DE029643,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Baltimore', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Communities', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Epidemiology', 'Dentists', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV therapy', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Prevalence', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injecting drug user', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intravenous', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Medical Records', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neurocognitive', 'Oral health', 'Organ', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Periodontitis', 'Periodontium', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary', 'Severities', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viremia', 'Visit', 'age related', 'aged', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'bone', 'care seeking', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'disability', 'experience', 'health care service', 'health literacy', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'longitudinal analysis', 'metabolomics', 'metaproteomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral microbiome', 'prognostic', 'retention rate', 'social', 'transcriptomics']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2020,903089,0.18768399177357148

In addition, several moderator analyses will be conducted to identify factors or subgroups that may impact or moderate the effects of interventions on outcomes. Meta-analysis of well-controlled trials provides the most powerful evidence available for the effects of treatment and is much more accessible and digestible to individual decision makers. The proposed project seeks to shift current research and clinical practice by conducting the first comprehensive meta-analysis on the treatment of HIV infected substance users.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will conduct a meta-analysis of interventions targeting HIV medication adherence and/or substance use among HIV positive substance users.

"MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR CHLAMYDIA RISK ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION:  (From investigator's abstract) The application organization has completed design and programming for a microcomputer software system providing personal self-administered risk assessment for HIV infection. The risk assessment is based upon an anonymous interactive interview and analysis performed by a rule-based expert system incorporated in the software.  The purpose of this proposal is to support revision and expansion of the software to accommodate simultaneous risk assessment for chlamydia trachomatis, the most prevalent sexually transmissible disease in the nation.  The system will not require respondents to possess specialized training or computer experience.  Following analysis of an individual's personal history taken by the interactive interview, the completed software will respond with advice as to whether the respondent is at risk for HIV and/or chlamydia trachomatis and will also write anonymous case data to DOS files for interface with statistical software.  n/a",MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR CHLAMYDIA RISK ASSESSMENT,3489527,R43AI031757,"['AIDS', ' Chlamydia trachomatis', ' HIV infections', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' early diagnosis', ' interview', ' pelvic inflammatory disease', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' technology /technique development', ' urethritis']",NIAID,"SCIENTIFIC SOCIAL RESEARCH, INC.",R43,1991,39570,0.09604317735433511
"In vivo proton MRS studies:cerebral injury in HIV infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a marked rise in survival rates among HIV-infected persons. To what extent the brain compartment benefits from such treatment, particularly in the setting of advanced, even stable, disease, remains unclear. Recent studies suggest that cerebral injury and neurocognitive impairment can persist or unfold in the setting of HAART and stable disease. The frequency, spectrum and extent of neurological injury, its relationship to cognitive functioning and responsiveness to antiretroviral therapies thus remain important yet unresolved issues. The HIV MRS consortium has identified regional and cellular abnormalities specific to different stages of HIV-associated cognitive impairment (AIDS dementia complex, ADC) as well as an in vivo model of brain injury that suggests basal ganglia and neuronal events may be critical to the development of ADC. It has also identified potential host (e.g. age, plasma MCP-1, CSFIP-10, CSF fractalkine) and viral factors (CSF HIV RNA) at baseline that may increase the risk for neurocognitive impairment (NCI) or its further decline. This is a five-year multicenter longitudinal study of cerebral injury (as measured by MRS) and NCI in 310 HIV-positive subjects with a history of advanced immunosuppression (nadir CD4<100/mL) on HAART. The study will fill an important gap in the literature by implementing MRS in a prospective design in order to identify subjects at risk for NCI. We will examine the pattern and dynamics of regional injury by MRS among 250 neurologically asymptomatic (NA) and 60 ADC subjects. The majority of subjects will be enrolled from three well characterized existing prospective cohorts, including two ACTG studies (N= 210) and from the brain bank studies UCLA NNAB and UCSD CNTN (N= 100). Subjects will be stratified by CD4 count at entry, <200 or >200 cells/ml. The brain bank subjects will be further divided into virologically suppressed and nonsuppressed groups. The primary aims are: 1) to identify NA subjects at risk for brain injury as measured by MRS and examine host (e.g. age, chemokines) and viral factors (HIV RNA) at baseline that may increase the risk for subsequent neurological injury and NCI; 2) to determine whether the emergence of basal ganglia and neuronal factors predict the onset of NCI or its progression; 3) to examine dynamic relationships between neurologic function, biomarkers that reflect changing virologic and immunologic activity and changes in treatment. Multivariate longitudinal models and variable selection will be used to study the neurological effects of HIV infection as a dynamic system of interrelated factors. Detection of brain injury among NA subjects on HAART and at risk for ADC will have critical ramifications for overall health outcome and early therapeutic intervention.            n/a",In vivo proton MRS studies:cerebral injury in HIV infection,7477239,R01NS036524,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'AIDS clinical trial group', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Age', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'CCL2 gene', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CXCR3 gene', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cerebrum', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Fractalkine', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Health', 'Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Indinavir', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Lamivudine', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Nevirapine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Plasma', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protons', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Score', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Stavudine', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Viral', 'Zidovudine', 'abacavir', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'chemokine', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'novel', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'white matter']",NINDS,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2008,2245305,0.06117619612252006

"Identifying Subgroups with Different Responses to HIV Risk Reduction Counseling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aware, a large (n=5012) randomized comparative effectiveness trial, found that HIV risk reduction counseling for HIV negative individuals at the time of an HIV test did not have an impact on cumulative incidence of However, the question remains as to whether there are subgroups that would benefit from counseling. Further, understanding how counseling paradoxically increased STIs in MSM, the group most at risk for HIV in the US, and whether there are other subgroups who increased STIs is of public health importance. In recent innovations machine learning techniques have been used specifically to uncover subgroups with differential treatment responses in a fashion that is replicable and does not suffer model over-fitting associated with multiple testing. We will extend methods to explore treatment subgroups and differences across minority groups based on two of these approaches-Random Forests (RF), and Virtual Twins (VT). The VT approach uses random forests as a first step to create separate forest-based predictions of outcomes under both treatment and control conditions for each trial participant. Then a person-specific treatment effect is created for each individual and a tree-based prediction is made. Whereas this procedure has been shown to be very promising, there is a tendency for the procedure to have relatively low sensitivity, and low positive predictive value. These problems may be alleviated by replacing the single tree predictor of the individual-specific treatment effect by the random forest procedure and/or reweighting of the classification problem to equalize the number of treatment successes (STI incidence is far from affecting 50% of the sample). We will use simulations to uncover the optimal strategy and then use the optimal strategy to create a model that predicts likelihood of future STIs based on behaviors and likelihood of the individual having a positive or negative impact of counseling. We will also use an extension of this model to find the factors associated with the observed MSM by counseling interaction observed in Project Aware. The significance of this research lies in 1) determining if there are subgroups of STD clinic patients who would benefit from or be harmed by short HIV risk reduction counseling 2) providing a model to target these individuals or understanding why they may show increased STIs, and 3) providing the groundwork for use of these approaches to understanding the heterogeneous response to other HIV prevention interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A recent large (n=5012) national study, Project Aware1, showed that on average there was no impact of brief risk reduction counseling on the likelihood of getting a new sexually transmitted infection (STI). This project will determine if there are subgroups of individuals who actually did benefit from brief risk reduction counseling and decreased their likelihood of a future STI as a result or subgroups that showed increases in STIs when counseled. If there are any subgroups with benefit of counseling evident in the data, this project will create a predictive model which could be used to identify individuals prospectively who would benefit from brief sexual risk reduction counseling when visiting an STD clinic; if there are subgroups with negative impact the project will help to understand why.",Identifying Subgroups with Different Responses to HIV Risk Reduction Counseling,8866385,R21DA038641,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sampling', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Trees', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'forest', 'group counseling', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'men who have sex with men', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2015,188996,0.15320478919618097

"STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY AND TARGETED DRUG DESIGN FOR AIDS This proposal will focus on the use of structural biology to aid in the development of drugs that can interfere in a specific manner with protein products of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome.  Since HIV is the etiological agent implicated in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), it is hoped that these drugs will cure or at least arrest the symptoms of AIDS. Finding a cure for AIDS in an extremely urgent health priority for the world.  However, it can be anticipated that the methodologies developed in this AIDS-targeted project could lay the foundations for the development of other anti-viral agents that inevitably will evolve in the future to plaque mankind.  Inhibitors will be developed toward several HIV proteins:  the reverse transcriptase, the protease, the integrase and the ribonuclease H activity of the reverse transcriptase. Recombinant methods for viral protein production will be developed.  These proteins, as well as viral proteins obtained from external sources, as appropriate, will be highly purified, crystallized and subjected to X-ray diffraction (or NMR) analysis.  The emerging structures will be modeled using computer graphics, and potential inhibitors will in turn be modeled into the structures using molecular mechanics, quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence.  Candidate inhibitors will be synthesized, tested with enzyme systems, and sometimes co-crystallized with the enzyme for further structural analysis.  Ideas for even more potent and selective inhibitors should then emerge.  Site-directed- mutagenesis will be used to refine notions about which groups on the enzyme are involved in the inhibitor process.  n/a",STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY AND TARGETED DRUG DESIGN FOR AIDS,3096308,P01GM039552,"['AIDS', ' antiAIDS agent', ' antiviral agents', ' chemical structure function', ' drug design /synthesis /production']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,P01,1987,1017579,0.08989204015528493
"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking.

"Stress response networks in HIV infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to understand cellular stress responses in HIV infection, and their relationship to circulating exosome cargo. In preliminary studies using samples and clinical data from cohorts of predominantly male African-American subjects with HIV infection, cocaine use was associated with increased markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered monoamine metabolism. Plasma exosomes and exosome-associated HSP70 were also increased in HIV+ cocaine users compared to HIV- controls. Furthermore, we identified plasma exosome miRNAs in HIV+ cocaine users that were also induced during cell stress responses in cell culture models. Based on preliminary data and predicted network models, we hypothesize that HIV infection induces cellular stress responses as a consequence of inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered monoamine metabolism. Cocaine augments these cellular stress responses through effects on catecholamines and dopamine, which increase energy demands, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Transcriptional and epigenetic regulators including REST, PGC-1alpha, and sirtuins are predicted to play key roles in regulating these cellular stress response networks and modulating cocaine-related effects on cells. Exosomes and other microvesicles released during cell stress responses contain protein and RNA cargo that represent potential biomarkers of these stress responses. To address this hypothesis, we propose integrated biology approaches using clinical samples and data to characterize exosomes and cellular stress responses in racially diverse cohorts of HIV+ subjects with and without cocaine use, and their relationship to clinical data. Integrative analysis of plasma exosome cargo, gene and miRNA expression profiles, inflammation and oxidative stress markers, metabolomics, and virological and immunological data along with targeted experimentation will be used to build, test, and refine models of networks and pathways involved in mediating cellular stress responses in HIV infection and their relationship to exosome cargo.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use large clinical and biological datasets, computational modeling, and integrated biology approaches to identify key regulatory networks and pathways involved in cellular stress responses in racially diverse cohorts with HIV infection and their relationship to circulating exosomes and other markers of stress responses.

"Characterizing proviral populations in brain tissues ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA-DA-15-018: Developing Technologies and Tools to Monitor HIV Brain Reservoirs and How They May be Altered by Exposure to Substances of Abuse. To meet this challenge in the R21 phase, we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure and characterize HIV DNA populations in brain and lymph node tissues. In particular, this platform will be able to measure and identify proviral populations that are (i) intact and replication competent, (ii) intact but replication incompetent, and (iii) not intact. We will develop and validate the proposed platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using brain and lymph node tissues from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years before death.

"INCREASING CONDOM USE WITH A STAGE MATCHED INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):  Over the past decade,                  heterosexual transmission of HIV has become an increasingly important            public health problem.  Effective behavioral interventions to increase           condom use are needed.  Such interventions should be theory-based and            capable of being delivered at low cost to large segments of the at-risk          population.  The proposed study provides an evaluation of the efficacy           of an intervention based on the conceptual framework of the                      Transtheoretic Model.  The intervention is designed to increase condom           use and readiness to use condoms in at-risk, heterosexually-active women         and men.  The intervention is computer-delivered using expert systems            technology and will be provided in health care settings.  Participants           will be recruited from four heath clinic sties that serve local ethnic           minority communities and will be randomly assigned by a computer to              either a stage-matched, individualized expert system intervention, or            to an HIV-information comparison group.  At the final time point, 400            economically disadvantaged women and men who are at risk for HIV                 infection will be in the study.  Assessment for both groups will be              conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention.  All              participant will receive comparable group-specific intervention                  materials at baseline, 2 and 4 months.  Specifically, participants               randomized to the stage-matched treatment group will receive                     individualized, stage-matched feedback and stage-tailored manuals, and           participants randomized to the HIV information comparison group will             receive HIV information feedback and the best available informational            manual.  Incentives for participation and alternative methods for                collecting data will be used to maximize participant retention.  A               secondary aim of the proposed project is to examine additional                   psychosocial mediators of condom use by testing the predictive efficacy          of the Multifaceted Model of HIV risk.  An important objective of the            study is to increase the understanding of sexual behavior change and to          demonstrate the efficacy of a promising intervention technology for              increasing condom use.  The study will also provide longitudinal outcome         data on condom adoption in at-risk heterosexual men and women.

"INCREASING CONDOM USE WITH A STAGE MATCHED INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):  Over the past decade,                  heterosexual transmission of HIV has become an increasingly important            public health problem.  Effective behavioral interventions to increase           condom use are needed.  Such interventions should be theory-based and            capable of being delivered at low cost to large segments of the at-risk          population.  The proposed study provides an evaluation of the efficacy           of an intervention based on the conceptual framework of the                      Transtheoretic Model.  The intervention is designed to increase condom           use and readiness to use condoms in at-risk, heterosexually-active women         and men.  The intervention is computer-delivered using expert systems            technology and will be provided in health care settings.  Participants           will be recruited from four heath clinic sties that serve local ethnic           minority communities and will be randomly assigned by a computer to              either a stage-matched, individualized expert system intervention, or            to an HIV-information comparison group.  At the final time point, 400            economically disadvantaged women and men who are at risk for HIV                 infection will be in the study.  Assessment for both groups will be              conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention.  All              participant will receive comparable group-specific intervention                  materials at baseline, 2 and 4 months.  Specifically, participants               randomized to the stage-matched treatment group will receive                     individualized, stage-matched feedback and stage-tailored manuals, and           participants randomized to the HIV information comparison group will             receive HIV information feedback and the best available informational            manual.  Incentives for participation and alternative methods for                collecting data will be used to maximize participant retention.  A               secondary aim of the proposed project is to examine additional                   psychosocial mediators of condom use by testing the predictive efficacy          of the Multifaceted Model of HIV risk.

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9851871,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2020,165510,0.08022339972734113

Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9424658,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2018,171483,0.08022339972734113
"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs. Using innovative multimodal data fusion approaches, this study will identify the distinct and shared neural signatures of HIV neurological disease and cocaine use disorder that are predictive of neurocognitive impairment.

"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention.

These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,9548431,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Acrolein', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aldehydes', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Antioxidants', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Immunologic Markers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxic effect', 'Urine', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'combustion product', 'immune activation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'marijuana smoke', 'marijuana use', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'monocyte', 'network models', 'neutrophil', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tobacco exposure', 'transcriptome', 'vascular inflammation', 'volatile organic compound']",NIDA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2018,616530,0.018918786742404804
"Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach Although uptake of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with HIV has increased dramatically in the past decade, poor health outcomes including non-AIDS-related comorbidity and mortality in HIV-infected PWID on cART remains a significant public health problem. A crucial knowledge gap is a lack of the understanding about how injection drug use (IDU) impacts the course of HIV disease. Differences in gene regulation affected by IDU and non-adherence to cART are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these treatments that may result in poor outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify genomic signatures for PWID and to link PWID-associated genomic signals to HIV outcomes in the context of cART exposure (i.e., levels in plasma). Our overall hypothesis is that PWID accrue DNA methylation (DNAm) and transcriptome variations that impact on health outcomes, and which may be explained in part by variability in cART exposure. This hypothesis is built on our previous findings showing that IDU significantly altered the blood DNA methylome in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, DNAm signatures associated with IDU differentiated less and greater HIV disease frailty. To test this hypothesis, our approach will first perform epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis and transcriptome-wide association analysis in HIV-infected PWID as compared to HIV-infected non-PWID who are treated with cART in two independent cohorts. Second, we will test the relationship between PWID-associated differentially methylated positions (DMP) or regions (DMR) and differential gene expression (DGE) on cART variability in plasma and also their relationships with HIV frailty and mortality. Last, we propose to integrate genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]), DNAm, and gene expression that differs by HIV-infected PWID/non-PWID status. Our goal is to identify DMP or DMR and DGE between HIV-infected PWID and non-PWID in the context of cART and to apply epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures as biomarkers to predict HIV frailty and mortality. The application proposes the first integrative pharmacogenomic approach of genetic variants, epigenomic and transcriptomic associations for HIV-infected PWID in the context of cART. We expect to identify PWID- associated genes that can predict HIV cART treatment outcomes. The predictive model resulting from this project can inform biomarker identification for HIV outcomes. The proposal is the first step towards the understanding of pharmacogenomics and pharamcoepigenomics in PWID with HIV infection. The results will fill the knowledge gap of the biological basis of IDU effects on HIV outcomes and provide evidence to prioritize genes for future research of their functions in HIV progression. People who inject drug use infected with HIV have high medical comorbidity and poor health outcomes despite the availability of combination anti-retroviral therapy. Our integrative pharmacogenomic approach aims to define a set of genes associated with HIV-infected injection drug use and anti-retroviral therapy that predict HIV outcomes.

"Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study Project Summary  Despite widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of HIV+ Americans will experience HIV-related neurological comorbidities that negatively impact daily functioning and clinical outcomes. Alterations in brain structure and function are consistently linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms through which HIV causes alterations in neural networks and associated cognitive function are not well characterized. Marijuana use, which is disproportionately prevalent among HIV+ persons, may increase the risk of HAND. Our preliminary work suggests that co-occurring marijuana use and HIV infection intensifies dysfunction in major neural networks, including white matter abnormalities and decoupling of functional activation patterns. Capitalizing on a strong foundation of neurobehavioral research on drug addiction and HIV/AIDS by our multidisciplinary team, the proposed research will apply connectomic analyses to achieve the following aims: (1) examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and marijuana on structural and functional organization of the brain; (2) investigate the longitudinal relationship between network-level disruptions in brain organization and cognitive impairment; and (3) use machine deep learning algorithms to develop individualized prediction models for HAND diagnosis and severity based on multimodal graph features. Using a cross-lagged panel design, 200 adults stratified by HIV and marijuana status (4 groups) will have multimodal MRIs and cognitive testing at baseline and 1 year later. The central hypothesis is that marijuana use will exacerbate structural and functional disruptions in brain organization that underlie the expression and progression of HAND. Our proposal responds directly to RFA-18- 610, which highlights the need for studies on “the underlying mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse and HIV infection interact to impair CNS functions mediated through altered neuronal networks.” This research uses a team science approach to address high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of HAND in persons with chronic substance use disorders and serve as targets for novel clinical interventions. In addition, our classification models are expected to provide a generalizable framework applicable to individual patients for tailoring of treatment approaches. Public Health Relevance  Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly half will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that impact daily functioning.

"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality).

We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction.

"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality).

"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury.

"Health Informatics to Model the Scott County HIV Outbreak ABSTRACT Many regions of the United States, particularly rural and frontier areas, lack the resources to proactively identify isolated infectious disease outbreaks. Scott County Indiana experienced an HIV outbreak in 2014- 2015, resulting in approximately 200 new HIV infections. If not for a vigilant Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) who noticed an escalating number of HIV infections in Scott County over a brief period of time, the outbreak could have been much worse. An isolated outbreak in resource-limited settings such as Scott County underscores the need for more innovative, automated, and real-time HIV biosurveillance systems in non-urban areas. To date, digital HIV epidemiologic research has relied almost exclusively on Twitter; however, this approach is likely too restrictive and has not yet yielded a promising approach to predicting HIV outbreaks. More heterogeneous sources of data--in addition to social media--may more efficiently predict the arrival of HIV in a community with limited surveillance resources. The proposed health informatics research will analyze historical time series data collected from 2014 through 2016 to identify predictor variables that model the Scott County HIV outbreak. Data to be analyzed include: (1) emergency room (ER) admissions and discharges related to opioid use and soft tissue infections related to drug abuse; (2) HIV testing surveillance data; (3) HCV incidence data; (4) search engine inquires of relevant topics, such as Google or Bing searches for “HIV testing” and “Opana”; (5) law enforcement arrest records (particularly those related to opioid possession and distribution); and (6) electronic healthcare reimbursement data of HIV-related treatments (e.g., post-exposure prophylaxis). Automated data/text mining and machine learning techniques will also be applied to (7) social media data (i.e., Twitter tweets and Reddit forum posts) that make reference to HIV, Opana, substance use, and other terms to determine if trends in social media data could have predicted HIV's arrival in, and transmission throughout, Scott County.

"Health Informatics to Model the Scott County HIV Outbreak ABSTRACT Many regions of the United States, particularly rural and frontier areas, lack the resources to proactively identify isolated infectious disease outbreaks. Scott County Indiana experienced an HIV outbreak in 2014- 2015, resulting in approximately 200 new HIV infections. If not for a vigilant Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) who noticed an escalating number of HIV infections in Scott County over a brief period of time, the outbreak could have been much worse. An isolated outbreak in resource-limited settings such as Scott County underscores the need for more innovative, automated, and real-time HIV biosurveillance systems in non-urban areas. To date, digital HIV epidemiologic research has relied almost exclusively on Twitter; however, this approach is likely too restrictive and has not yet yielded a promising approach to predicting HIV outbreaks. More heterogeneous sources of data--in addition to social media--may more efficiently predict the arrival of HIV in a community with limited surveillance resources. The proposed health informatics research will analyze historical time series data collected from 2014 through 2016 to identify predictor variables that model the Scott County HIV outbreak. Data to be analyzed include: (1) emergency room (ER) admissions and discharges related to opioid use and soft tissue infections related to drug abuse; (2) HIV testing surveillance data; (3) HCV incidence data; (4) search engine inquires of relevant topics, such as Google or Bing searches for “HIV testing” and “Opana”; (5) law enforcement arrest records (particularly those related to opioid possession and distribution); and (6) electronic healthcare reimbursement data of HIV-related treatments (e.g., post-exposure prophylaxis).

"The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease ABSTRACT Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals living with HIV experience an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although increased arterial inflammation on 18F-FDG-PET was shown to be associated with high risk plaque features (HRPFs) in those with HIV and subclinical atherosclerosis, there is no evidence of increased arterial inflammation in optimally treated HIV-infected adults with full viral suppression, low cardiovascular risk and no known CAD when the imaging results are compared to those from HIV- uninfected controls. These findings suggest that HIV-associated atherosclerosis may be triggered by factors other than HIV-associated inflammation such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors or cocaine use. Other evidence indicates that cocaine is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. It was also shown that cocaine use modifies the effect of HIV on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Supported by DA035632, this research team enrolled 102 daily cocaine users (including 84 HIV-infected) with contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-confirmed significant (>50% in diameter) coronary stenosis, and employed a cash- incentive approach to systematically reinforce cocaine abstinence. The study demonstrated that continued cocaine use led to coronary plaque volume progression, while abstinent or reduced cocaine use led to plaque volume regression. However, whether cocaine use influences plaque characteristics in HIV-infected cocaine users has not been investigated. Plaque characteristics are important because rupture-prone coronary plaques might not necessarily be only those, which cause obstructive stenosis, and that HRPFs are independent of the severity of coronary artery luminal stenosis. However, identification of the strongest predictor of CAD among four HRPFs, the napkin-ring sign (NRS), at present, is based only on expert subjective opinion. A landmark cardiovascular radiomics study calculated 4,440 radiomic features for each coronary plaque and identified a subset of these parameters which predicted NRS, a qualitative feature of prognostic imaging marker of acute coronary syndrome. It is quite possible that with the cardiac radiomic approach, the association between cocaine use and this critical biomarker will be further clarified. The objective of the proposed study is to examine whether cocaine use influences plaque features in HIV-infected cocaine users. The proposed study will perform radiomic analyses on the imaging data from 102 participants on DA035632. The specific aims of this study are: (1) To examine whether continued cocaine use is associated with the NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (2) To examine whether abstinent or reduced cocaine use ameliorated NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (3) To compare NRS and its associated radiomic features between HIV infected and uninfected participants, and (4) To validate the findings generated from this study.

"Novel, Adaptive Approaches to Predicting and Responding to Outbreaks of Overdose, HIV and HCV Among People Who Use Drugs Project Summary Opioid use disorder (OUD), HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) are co-occurring epidemics—a syndemic—among people who inject drugs (PWID). While effective interventions exist to prevent and treat all three conditions, the United States (US) has seen a 200% surge in overdoses linked to opioids since 2000, and a rise in acute HCV infections since 2010. In addition, an outbreak of HIV in Scott County, Indiana in 2014-2015, led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to list 220 counties in the US as high-risk for HIV and HCV epidemics among PWID. Within the past year, new outbreaks of HIV among PWID have been reported in multiple states across the US, including West Virginia (WV), Ohio (OH), Kentucky (KY) and Massachusetts (MA). The current tools being used to target and manage responses to new outbreaks are inadequate to the task of stemming their spread and impact: syndromic surveillance can identify, but not predict new overdose events; rates of undiagnosed HIV and HCV infection remain high, particularly among young people; and interventions to prevent and treat OUD, HIV and HCV do not reach the vast majority of PWID who need them. I am proposing an innovative, interdisciplinary research program integrating spatial epidemiological methods, spatiotemporal regression models, Bayesian learning techniques, operations research and sequential decision- making methods to address the deficiencies in contemporary approaches to this syndemic among PWID. Leading a team of researchers, public health experts, clinicians and other front-line service providers, I will develop new predictive algorithms to map evolving community risk for overdose; novel adaptive approaches to hotspot detection for HIV and HCV and; algorithms to guide the pre-deployment and micro-targeting of prevention and treatment interventions for all three diseases to reach those most at risk and in need. All of these state-of-the-art methods will be freely available in a suite of web applications to allow practitioners to visualize the local interaction between these three interlocking epidemics. In addition, the web application will allow users to target services for PWID for OUD, HIV and HCV as well as assist decision-makers in optimal responses based on epidemiologic and economic considerations. Preliminary work on these algorithms and a prototype of the web applications are now underway with open-source data on overdose from Cincinnati, OH and data from OH and Connecticut have been obtained to scale-up this work. This project thus represents a groundbreaking effort in which the latest insights from a variety of scientific disciplines will be combined to offer new epidemiological insights into the interactions between OUD, HIV and HCV at the local level and for rapid implementation into the field to ensure timely public health impact on OUD, HIV and HCV among PWID in the US. Project Narrative This project will clarify how three interlocking epidemics—of opioid use disorder, HIV and hepatitis C—play out across cities and towns, across time, and down to the level of census tracts and neighborhoods in the US. Through an interdisciplinary approach combining epidemiology, statistics, operations research and decision science, the project will provide a framework for predicting and quickly responding to each of these epidemics alone and in combination at the local level. The results of the project will be translated into a web application and other support tools to guide decision-makers as they confront and seek to respond more efficiently to the current public health crisis among people who use drugs.","Novel, Adaptive Approaches to Predicting and Responding to Outbreaks of Overdose, HIV and HCV Among People Who Use Drugs",9821365,DP2DA049282,"['Acute Hepatitis C', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian learning', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug user', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'HIV', 'HIV/HCV', 'Indiana', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Kentucky', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Ohio', 'Operations Research', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Services', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'West Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'effective intervention', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'open data', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'service providers', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'stem', 'support tools', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'web app']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2019,2512500,0.17141880476088003
"uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the U.S. Substance use is an important influence on HIV risk among GBMSM; and partner seeking for both sex and substance use have largely moved online and to geosocial networking platforms designed for GBMSM (e.g., Grindr). Technological advances in the collection and mining of “big data” to inform behavioral health interventions have increased in recent years but have not been applied directly to HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction among GBMSM. At the same time, despite major advances in biomedical HIV prevention (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and substance use harm-reduction (i.e., medication assisted therapy [MAT]), these strategies are underutilized by GBMSM. My research team and I conducted formative research on social media data mining and machine learning through a NIDA A/START (R03) to identify patterns of technology use that are associated with HIV risk and substance use among GBMSM. We established computational functionality of a culturally tailored social media data mining program among substance using GBMSM. I now take an important scientific risk to use this technology to develop an HIV prevention intervention for GBMSM, tentatively titled uTECH, that leverages insights from machine learning to trigger personalized intervention content in order to increase biomedical HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction. Specifically, I propose to conduct a two-phase study. In Phase 1 I will conduct qualitative interviews with GBMSM to inform the iterative development and refinement of uTECH. In Phase 2, I will test the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of uTECH in a comparative implementation science trial. For this phase, I will (a) enroll racially diverse, HIV-negative, substance using GBMSM; (b) randomize them to either the uTECH intervention or a comparison group; and (c) measure acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility through 6 months post-intervention. My primary implementation science outcomes will be acceptability (i.e., Acceptability of Intervention Measure [AIM]), appropriateness (i.e., Intervention Appropriateness Measure [IAM]), and feasibility (i.e., Feasibility of Intervention Measure [FIM]). I believe that the power of “big data” and new technologies can be harnessed for effective HIV prevention with substance using GBMSM. In the era of increasing HIV prevention fatigue among GBMSM, the ability to deliver quick, convenient and highly personalized interventions presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and substance use is an important factor driving new HIV infections in this population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among GBMSM by refining and testing the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of an innovative, social media “big data” machine learning intervention, which aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies.",uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM,9822931,DP2DA049296,"['AIDS prevention', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bisexual', 'Collection', 'Development', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Gays', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV risk', 'Harm Reduction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'behavioral health intervention', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'data mining', 'design', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men who have sex with men', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'post intervention', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social media', 'transmission process']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2019,2340000,0.16270345612133905
"Utilizing Twitter to Identify and Recruit Young Black Men at High Risk of HIV Infection Project Summary  The disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS among Black men underscores a dire need for technologically innovative and culturally-responsive approaches to reduce HIV in Black communities. There is evidence that social media platforms such as Twitter may offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify and recruit young Black men (YBM) at elevated risk, but to date there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support that social media based-recruitment using natural language processing is feasible and/or acceptable. On social media platforms like Twitter, young men share substance and sex related content. We propose mining these Twitter posts to identify YBM who may be at risk of elevated HIV, based on their substance and sexual risk posts. This study will serve as a proof of method to test the extent to which we can identify and recruit YBM based on their social media posts. We will extend and calibrate our “High-Risk Language” (HRL) algorithm to identify users who post HIV-risk related language on Twitter. Those who agree to participate and deemed eligible will complete a qualitative interview and in- person study visit which includes HIV testing, multi-drug screening, and a survey of their sexual risk and substance use behaviors. Our primary outcomes are; (1) condomless (and/or without PrEP) vaginal or anal sex and (2) illicit drug use before or during sex. We will assess the yield and accuracy of our HRL algorithm at identifying YBM at risk, compared to their biomarkers and surveys. This work will test cutting-edge research tools aimed at increasing the rigor and precision of online recruitment efforts to reduce HIV in the Black community.

"HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs early after infection. Viral adaptation to replication in the CNS and its immunologic sequelae results in clinical neuropathological sequelae in up to 50% of untreated patients. Both host and viral determinants may mediate the neuropathology that results in the clinical syndromes of HIV associated dementia (HIV-D) and minor motor cognitive disorder (MMCD). In this study, we will examine the rate and possible determinants of evolution of HIV-1 in the CNS through 3 specific aims. SA 1: HIV-1 gp160 and nef sequence evolution will be assessed by comparing plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients identified in primary infection that are followed over 3 to 5 years employing rapid and sensitive screening of length polymorphism in V1-2 A/4-5 of env and clonal sequence analysis of env and nef. Concurrently, blood and CSF virus comparisons will be performed on longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients with chronic infection over a 3 to 5 year period to provide. Where differences are found, machine learning algorithms and multiple regression analysis will be performed to identify individual positions that contribute to sequence evolution with attention to glycosylation sites that alter neutralization by antibody, V3 positions that affect tropism or putative neurotoxicity, and CTL epitopes described in both env and nef. SA 2: In well characterized autopsy samples, CSF, plasma, parenchymal brain regions, spleen, lymph node and colon will be examined for proviral DNA sequences and RNA sequences, in order to characterize the composition of the HIV population in CNS and to determine the subset of viral variants that are productively replicating.

"Development of a novel community-based high-performance surveillance network for drug use PROJECT SUMMARY Surveillance efforts for substance use are failing us. They rely on outdated risk prediction tools yet risk factors for HIV and overdose are context-specific and are impacted by the interplay between patient-, provider-, and system-level factors as well as epidemiologic realities in a community. They rely on direct estimation methods for measuring prevalence yet barriers such as lack of access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and harm reduction services, stigma, criminalization of drug use, and unaffordable housing prevent people who use drugs (PWUD) from being counted. Additionally, they rarely involve community engagement and surveillance data are not disseminated effectively to communities to achieve maximum benefit. In the context of the ongoing overdose crisis and recent outbreaks of HIV among PWUD in Indiana, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and West Virginia, the failures of this basic tool of public health take on a new urgency. The number of efficacious programs and interventions to prevent and treat substance use and HIV continues to grow, but without accurate estimates of the size of the pool of people at risk of overdose and for acquiring HIV and knowledge of their specific risk factors, these interventions cannot reach their full potential. We cannot reach people who we do not know exist and are at risk. We, therefore, need to immediately modernize and upgrade our surveillance capacity to understand the size and composition of drug-using populations. I am proposing an innovative, interdisciplinary research program that integrates epidemiology, community engagement, biostatistics, econometrics, and information dissemination to create a novel community-based, high- performance surveillance network for PWUD. I will do this by (1) creating a community engaged research (CEnR) process around big data for PWUD; (2) building community-specific risk prediction algorithms for HIV acquisition, disease progression, and loss to follow up among PWUD; (3) using enhanced indirect estimation methods to determine the size of populations of PWUD and to evaluate the impact of interventions; and (4) disseminating findings and translating research into action. The data centerpiece of this program will be the Public Health Data Warehouse, an individually-linked database from more than 15 Massachusetts government agencies, which includes more than 97% of the Massachusetts population. Preliminary analyses with this database are underway and will be made accessible to communities in real-time. This project represents an approach that is entirely divergent from traditional surveillance techniques by using a combination of complex methodologies with the community always at the center of the process—from initiation to final output. This novel Massachusetts cOMmunity-bAsed Drug use surveillANCE (“Moma Dance”) Network will begin in Massachusetts, but will serve as a model for other states and jurisdictions as they contend with the failures of their own surveillance systems for PWUD. These efforts will translate research into action at the community level and have an immediate and sustained public health impact on the drug use and HIV epidemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will create a novel community-based, high-performance surveillance network for people who use drugs (PWUD) through an interdisciplinary approach that combines community engaged research, machine learning, indirect estimation, and dissemination science. Through this process, communities will gain a more complete understanding of context- and community-specific risk factors and the true scope of the problem. This network will facilitate rapid knowledge transfer to communities, directly informing clinical care and local policy decisions regarding service planning and resource allocation, as they seek to respond to the ongoing drug epidemic in the U.S.",Development of a novel community-based high-performance surveillance network for drug use,10054384,DP2DA051864,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Government Agencies', 'HIV', 'Harm Reduction', 'Housing', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Kentucky', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Output', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'West Virginia', 'base', 'clinical care', 'community building', 'community involvement', 'data warehouse', 'econometrics', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social stigma', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance network', 'tool']",NIDA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,DP2,2020,2670000,0.08500537493092607
"A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use Disorder PROJECT ABSTRACT  The opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. It has led to an increased incidence of opioid overdose, injection substance use, and, eventually, HIV transmission. More than 171,000 people in the United States are living with HIV as a result of substance use disorder (SUD). Despite the known fact that both HIV and SUD significantly disturbs both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, their underlying molecular mechanisms, and interplay to immune dysfunction remain unexplored. Comprehensive functional characterization at a single-cell resolution is essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the molecular dynamics of immune dysfunction up HIV infection and SUD. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR- seq) with high-dimensional, multi-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the transcriptional, epigenetic, and network alterations and to key immune dysfunction drivers associated with HIV and SUD. Specifically, we will (1) Integrate novel functional genomics assays with single-cell multi-omics data to construct cell-type-specific multi-modal gene regulatory network (GRNs) in healthy individuals, (2) build a comprehensive immune profiling data hub for HIV/SUD-affected individuals and construct disease- and cell-type-specific GRNs, (3) uncover how key network changes and aberrant behaviors of TFs upon HIV infection and/or SUD can lead to immune dysfunction. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on transcriptome analyses, this proposed work presents a genuinely novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles at a single-cell resolution. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements at a single-cell resolution will expand the number of known functional regions. The constructed immune cell atlas, GRNs, and identify key drivers of immune dysfunction will be accessible to the public via web services and annotation databases. Our integrative computational efforts will be released distributed open-source programs. Altogether, our released resource will accelerate research in the broader scientific community by providing essential tools to investigate immune function, which will benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of immune system function of HIV and/or SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage high-dimensional, multi-scale, and highly heterogeneous genomics data to discover the essential molecular alterations of immune cells introduced by HIV and/or substance use disorder (SUD) at a single-cell resolution. In contrast to existing methods that rely on either transcriptome or epigenome only, this work assumes that several key transcriptomic, epigenetic, and regulatory network alterations jointly occur with HIV and/or SUD, resulting in immune system dysfunction. Hence, we propose a computational framework to depict the comprehensive immune cell regulome, construct molecular networks of various cell types, and pinpoint key immune dysfunction driver events at a single-cell resolution.","A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use Disorder",10055913,R01DA051906,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human Cell Line', 'Humoral Immunities', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Natural Immunity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Psychological Transfer', 'PubMed', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data hub', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'high dimensionality', 'immune function', 'immune system function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health emergency', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'web services']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,567700,0.04295842952696871
"Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) Approach to Understanding the Biology Underlying HIV and Drug Abuse. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed study is to advance our understanding of the complex networks of biology underlying variation in HIV viral load (VL) and latent reservoir (LR) among HIV+ individuals, and how cocaine abuse (CA) affects identified biological networks. With the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and public health strategies to reduce HIV incidence, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug users. Managing HIV progression (HP) and searching for an HIV cure are of paramount importance. Higher pretreatment VL is associated with HP and is associated with a larger LR. An HIV cure is dependent on eliminating the LR. Cocaine is one of the most frequently abused illicit drugs among HIV+ individuals and is known to increase VL, worsen HP, slow decline of viral production after cART, and, we hypothesize, affect the quantity of LR. Thus, there is a complex web of relationships among VL, LR, and CA, which are partially driven by and mediated through genetic susceptibility and gene regulation. As concluded by Le Cleric et al. (2019) in their recent review: “Only integrative approaches that combine all big data results and consider their complex interactions will allow us to capture the global picture of HIV molecular pathogenesis. This novel challenge will require large collaborative efforts and represents a huge open field for innovative bioinformatics approaches.” We propose Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) as a multi-method, multi-omic framework for discovering and understanding the biology underlying HIV outcomes and the effect of CA. We will apply Explainable Artificial Intelligence, network mapping, and Lines-of-Evidence integration to existing genome-, methylome-, and transcriptome-wide data across a number of cohorts in the following aims:   Aim 1: Identify gene networks underlying variation in HIV VL and LR applying GNetii.   Aim 2: Identify differences in HIV associated gene networks by CA.  This robustly designed study is significant and innovative: targeting key HIV outcomes affected by CA,  applying big data techniques to identify gene networks across multiple omics (enhancing discovery and  biological interpretation), and leveraging unique LR data. Our multiple Principal Investigator team includes  expertise in HIV, drug abuse, and computational biology. Thus, we are likely to produce important new  insights into key elements of HIV as a chronic disease: providing a basis for targeting unique features of CA  that impact VL and LR, which make HIV management and a cure more challenging in this population. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and public health strategies to reduce new HIV infections, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug users. Cocaine is one of the most frequently abused illicit drugs among HIV+ individuals and is known to worsen HIV progression, even with ART, and is likely to increase the latent reservoir of virus: the latent reservoir blocking efforts for an HIV cure. We will apply cutting-edge big data techniques across multiple genome-wide data types and cohorts to produce important new insights into key elements of HIV as a chronic disease among cocaine users, providing a basis for improved treatment and identification of targets for new medication development.",Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) Approach to Understanding the Biology Underlying HIV and Drug Abuse.,10056018,R01DA051908,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Abuse', 'Cocaine Users', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug user', 'Elements', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Network-based', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral reservoir', 'Virus Latency', 'Woman', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'cohort', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Expression', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2020,631522,0.2064834824621476
"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project. The proposed approaches will advance precision medicine by refining disease classification and facilitating gene finding for addictive and other mental disorders.",Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder,10056455,R01DA051922,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Use Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biobank', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cocaine use', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'data structure', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,465370,0.04624719539953107
"The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response It is estimated that approximately half of HIV-infected individuals in the United States are over 50 years of age. Aging of the HIV-infected population has linked alterations in immune responses associated with age and the immunologic consequences of chronic HIV infection. This intersection of HIV and aging will influence host defense against infection and response to vaccines. As a result, understanding the nexus of HIV-associated immune activation and immunosenescence takes on particular urgency. We will leverage insights from our published and ongoing studies on the effects of aging on dysregulated innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function, a novel population of pro-inflammatory IL-7 receptor alow effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells that are expanded in HIV-negative older adults, and on expansion of EM CD8 T cells in older HIV-positive adults. We have also elucidated gene expression and immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older HIV-negative adults. These findings position us to illuminate the effects of aging and HIV infection on innate and adaptive immune function, particularly following influenza vaccination. To address these questions, we have assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in the study of aging of the innate and adaptive human immune systems, and in HIV immunology, biology and clinical care. Our overarching hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory environment associated with age and with suppressed HIV infection potentiates immunosenescence in older adults with HIV disease. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll young (age 21-35) and older (age over 65) adults with HIV infection receiving high-dose influenza vaccine. We will employ state of the art methods including multichannel mass cytometry on whole blood to assess development and activation of major populations (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils), including novel studies of platelets pre- and post-vaccine. We will evaluate innate immune PRR function (including Toll-like and NOD-like receptor family members), where we previously found age-associated alterations in cytokine production and costimulatory protein expression that were related to influenza vaccine response. We will also study T cell responses to in vitro vaccine antigen stimulation, including the IL-7 receptor alow EM CD8 T cell subset. Statistical modeling will include clinical and functional covariates (e.g. CD4+ T cell count, estimated duration of HIV disease and of ART, medical co-morbidities, medication use, functional status). Finally, we will derive gene expression signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older adults with HIV disease, and compare these to those we previously identified in HIV-negative adults. We will employ state of the art analytic methods to integrate gene expression and immunologic data to obtain a comprehensive view of the human immune response in the context of age and immune suppression. These studies ultimately are aimed at identifying pathways amenable to pharmacologic targeting to improve immune and vaccine responses in older (and young) adults with HIV disease.

"COMPUTER EDUCATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR HIV INFECTION This project is to support the continued testing, validation, and refinement of computer software for personal anonymous risk assessment for HIV infection.  The software, originally developed as a stand-alone microcomputer system, performs a detailed interview in privacy.  Personal sexual history data provided by the respondent is analyzed by the software's expert system which incorporates probability computation supported by databases consisting of local estimates of HIV infection and per-event infectivity specific to vaginal and anal intercourse.  The software also interviews respondents and assesses risk on the basis of personal intravenous drug abuse and blood transfusion history.  The software advises respondents as to whether their past experience places them at risk for HIV infection.  If so, they are advised to follow up with antibody tests. Users not at risk are cautioned to avoid risk of exposure to HIV.  The interactive interview is preceded by a sequence of educational screens.  Additionally, the software writes anonymous interview data to disk file for statistical analysis in support of health behavior research.  The software was tested in a preliminary study which yielded publication. Continued research was supported by a Phase I SBIR grant.

"Multiscale studies of HIV infection and treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this application is to develop physical models and mathematical tools for optimizing treatments of HIV with fusion-inhibiting therapies. Kinetic data of virion-receptor interactions will be used to quantitatively categorize HIV strains based on fusogenicity (in the presence of varying CD4 and CCR5 receptor surface concentrations). Assays for mixtures of HIV strains will be proposed. Specific aims include:    (1) Developing chemical kinetic models for HIV virus envelope protein-cell receptor interactions and fusion rates. These models will be used to analyze kinetic measurements and estimate parameters used in within-host virus population models. (2) Developing statistical measures for categorizing strains based on kinetic binding and fusion data. Two approaches will be used: principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. PCA will be applied directly to the data to find the viral strains whose fusogenicities span a sufficient range in receptor/coreceptor (e.g., CD4/CCR5) concentrations.

"Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent applications of machine learning methods to epidemiologic data have led to discoveries of novel disease profiles with implications for clinical treatment and practice, including novel phenotypes of heart failure. Machine learning is attractive for large data sets because its algorithms can incorporate many more variables than standard regression methods, take into account temporality and other types of multidimensionality, and easily incorporate non-linearity and multiple interactions. Atherosclerosis is an ideal condition in which to apply machine learning methods, because its pathogenesis is known to be multifactorial, but precise causes are still not fully understood. In the context of HIV infection, its pathogenesis is further complicated by multiple comorbidities, potential adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV itself, mediated by immune activation and inflammation even in the context of long-term suppressive ART. We plan to apply the innovation of machine learning to discover new phenotypes of HIV-associated atherosclerosis that may reflect distinct pathways and affect clinical outcomes. Our Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) cohorts are two of the most well-established epidemiologic studies of HIV infection in existence. Each cohort has conducted serial imaging of atherosclerosis since 2002 in over 3,000 participants, and across 20-30 years of follow-up, cohort members have each contributed thousands of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data points. Most cohort members are now 50-59 years of age, while substantial numbers are in their sixth or seventh decade of life, allowing us to examine disease features and risk factors across the age spectrum. We propose to use machine learning methods to develop novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis among HIV-infected WIHS women and MACS men (Aim 1), and then determine the utility of these phenotypes by assessing their associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and other age-related clinical and functional outcomes, including traditional “geriatric” outcomes (Aims 2-3). Individuals with HIV infection have evidence of accelerated aging; prior studies have typically evaluated isolated outcomes despite the fact that aging is inherently a multifactorial and complex process. By using machine learning methods to identify novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis that may require different preventive or treatment interventions, this project has the potential to lead to new insights into the role of aging in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis among HIV-infected adults. 8.

We propose to use machine learning methods to develop novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis among HIV-infected WIHS women and MACS men (Aim 1), and then determine the utility of these phenotypes by assessing their associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and other age-related clinical and functional outcomes, including traditional “geriatric” outcomes (Aims 2-3). Individuals with HIV infection have evidence of accelerated aging; prior studies have typically evaluated isolated outcomes despite the fact that aging is inherently a multifactorial and complex process. By using machine learning methods to identify novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis that may require different preventive or treatment interventions, this project has the potential to lead to new insights into the role of aging in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis among HIV-infected adults. 8.

"An Interactive Video Game for HIV Prevention in At-Risk Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Video games are ubiquitous, can improve health behavior, but have not been evaluated as a tool to promote protection from HIV transmission in minority early adolescents. A major challenge in HIV prevention for minority adolescents is capturing individuals in     their environment - meeting individuals ""where they live"". The current application combines proven HIV prevention strategies and an interactive video game platform that incorporates virtual environments and intelligent conversant virtual characters to address this challenge. Research demonstrates that adolescents who acquire new knowledge, skills and attitudes in a video game, and practice these skills in the game, are more likely to behave similarly in real life. Therefore, the goal of this application is to adapt existing software to develop and refine an interactive video game designed to decrease HIV risk by teaching minority adolescents sex, drug and alcohol negotiation and refusal skills. The game will be adapted with input from minority adolescents, and collaborators with expertise in positive youth development, social cognitive theory and self-efficacy, prospect theory and message framing, software and artificial intelligence development, and commercial game design. We will evaluate the efficacy of the game by conducting a randomized clinical trial in 330 minority youths, ages 9-14 years, attending an after-school and/or weekend youth program, who will be randomly assigned to play the interactive HIV prevention video game, ""Retro-Warriors"", or to play a commercial ""off-the-shelf"" video game. Subjects will play two sessions/week of their assigned game for four weeks. The primary outcome will be initiation of sexual activity, defined as the initiation of either vaginal or anal intercourse. Secondary outcomes include HIV risk behavior knowledge, social competency, self-efficacy, drug/alcohol use behaviors and overall risk-taking behaviors. We hypothesize that the experimental group will have lower rates of initiation of sexual activity and have higher knowledge scores at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared with the control group. We will also explore if selected baseline characteristics are associated with an improved response to the negotiation skills training intervention embedded in the interactive video game. Unique features of this intervention will include the use of virtual characters or avatars who can verbally respond to and interact with the player, a realistic virtual urban setting, the use of sex, drug/alcohol ""risk challenges"" that the subjects can practice repeatedly, the use of message framing according to prospect theory, a fun and engaging intervention that encourages repeated involvement, and the ability to track the players' choices and behaviors in the game. The successful implementation of this application will represent a paradigm shift, providing evidence for the role of interactive games as HIV/AIDS prevention in minority adolescents. Video game technology has the potential to expand the available vehicles for HIV prevention to the increasing number of electronic gaming platforms including the internet, personal digital assistants, and cell phones, thereby creating a new avenue for public health interventions.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is designed to develop and test a video game that will teach minority adolescents how to avoid sex, drug and alcohol risk behaviors that can lead to HIV infection. The research goes beyond the use of a game for education and proposes to create an interactive world in which the game players can engage in ""role-playing"" to learn to avoid risky behaviors. This application has far-reaching implications including the potential for this technology to ""travel"" with the player, i.e., the player ultimately can do sessions from home, on a console, a cell phone, or a personal digital assistant. There are international implications given that access to the internet is growing in developing countries and these technologies could be transferred to adolescents in countries experiencing a growing HIV epidemic but who have limited access to targeted risk reduction strategies. If successful, the results of this research will be video game technology that can improve individual and public health and decrease HIV transmission.

There are international implications given that access to the internet is growing in developing countries and these technologies could be transferred to adolescents in countries experiencing a growing HIV epidemic but who have limited access to targeted risk reduction strategies. If successful, the results of this research will be video game technology that can improve individual and public health and decrease HIV transmission.",An Interactive Video Game for HIV Prevention in At-Risk Adolescents,7749889,R01HD062080,"['AIDS prevention', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anus', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Experimental Games', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Hand', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Personal Digital Assistant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Sex Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Tools', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Vagina', 'Video Games', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'age group', 'alcohol risk', 'avoid sex', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'externalizing behavior', 'high risk', 'improved', 'meetings', 'member', 'neurobehavioral', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,820866,0.16900658409992697
"Wyoming Rural AIDS Prevention Research Project (WRAP) This proposal is in response to the NIMH RFA MH-01-003, ""Communication and HIV/STD Prevention"". Seventy-four percent of male HIV cases in Wyoming are among men who have sex with men (MSM).  MSM in rural areas are isolated and tend to be secretive about their sexual preferences.  Primary means of socializing and meeting sexual partners is by electronic communication and traveling to urban areas.  Fear of discovery and/or lack of self- identification as gay or bisexual may inhibit rural MSM from attending face-to-face interventions.  Fear, homophobia, and distance prohibit rural MSM from creating identifiable communities, may make community level interventions irrelevant. Although intensive interventions may be cost effective in cities, it is doubtful that small, rural jurisdictions will ever have sufficient funds to implement extensive HIV risk reduction interventions.  The development of Internet risk reduction interventions targeting MSM in rural areas presents a unique and cost effective means for intervention delivery.  Although Internet interventions have been shown to be useful for assessing sexuality issues, little is known about the dynamics of recruiting and retaining MSM in internet interventions or about the efficacy of internet delivered sexual risk reduction interventions.  The Wyoming Rural AIDS Prevention Research Project will be implemented in 2 phases and accomplish the following specific aims: Phase l) Determine the dynamics of Internet use by MSM and develop a typology of HIV risk among rural MSM, and Phase 2) Determine the acceptability and effectiveness of 4 Internet interventions (Information, Self- efficacy, Expert system, Social Network).  Social Cognitive theory will be used as an organizing tool for identifying precursors to behavior change.  In phase 1 a purposeful sample of 60 men for focus groups and 480 MSM for the Internet assessment will be recruited.

"Interferon Stimulated Genes with Antiviral Properties to HIV-1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anti-HIV drugs must target cells of the macrophage lineage because they are one of the first cell types infected and provide a persistent reservoir for HIV replication. It is clear that pretreatment of monocyte- derived macrophages (MDMs) with IFN-a2 and -¿ protects them from HIV replication by inhibiting viral DMA synthesis and RNA production. However, the full repertoire of host factors induced by Type I interferon (IFN) treatment that protect cells from HIV replication is presently unknown. Furthermore, recent clinical trials have shown that pegylated forms of IFN-a2 can reduce viral loads in HIV-infected patients. Following renewed interest for IFN in the clinical setting, it is important to determine the efficacies of different Type I IFNs for HIV inhibition, identify interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with anti-HIV properties, and investigate the mechanisms by which they inhibit HIV replication. The first step in anti-HIV ISG discovery is to identify Type I IFNs that are strong inhibitors of HIV replication in MDMs. IFN-a1, -a2, -a7, -¿, -?, -?, and -t4 are representative of the different classes of Type I IFN and their HIV inhibitory properties will be determined by calculating their 50% effective inhibitory concentration (IC50). Gene expression analysis of uninfected MDMs will then be used to identify the subset of ISGs modulated by each Type I IFN under study. Anti-HIV ISGs will initially be identified as genes upregulated in common by Type I IFNs that are strong inhibitors (low IC50) of HIV replication compared to those that are only weakly inhibitory (high IC50). Anti-HIV ISGs will then be prioritized using the literature record and pathway, domain and promoter analysis, and their expression confirmed at the protein level. The stage of the HIV life cycle inhibited by a particular anti-HIV ISG will be determined in gene overexpression experiments by measuring virus replication at the DMA, RNA and protein (p24) level. Gene knockdown experiments will determine the contribution of an anti-HIV ISG to the general IFN response and reveal those that are truly necessary for HIV inhibition. When these studies are complete, we will have determined the therapeutic potential of different species of Type I IFN for the inhibition of HIV replication and identified the specific ISGs that facilitate this inhibition. Lay Abstract. This proposal will identify those species of Type I interferon that are the most effective at inhibiting HIV replication. Furthermore, this research aims to determine those cellular genes whose expression is turned on by interferon treatment and produce proteins that inhibit HIV replication. Knowledge of genes that have anti-HIV properties will aid the design of more effective therapies to treat HIV-infected patients.           n/a",Interferon Stimulated Genes with Antiviral Properties to HIV-1,7230299,R21AI065242,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Cells', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA chemical synthesis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cell type', 'day', 'design', 'gene discovery', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'interferon therapy', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'response', 'text searching', 'transmission process']",NIAID,VETERANS MEDICAL RESEARCH FDN/SAN DIEGO,R21,2007,134581,0.19793686382395698
"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented.

"Child Abuse, HIV Risks and Reproductive Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This RO3 application seeks two years of funding for secondary analyses to: (1) combine two community based multi-ethnic samples of women in Los Angeles County; the Women and Family Project (NIMH48269), a sample of 318 HIV-positive and 172 HIV-negative women, and the Los Angeles Women's Study (NIMH 33603), consisting of 905 HIV-negative women; (2) construct a child sexual abuse severity index (CSASI) of 6 dimensions of child sexual abuse experiences; and (3) examine the differential effects of the CSASI on HIV serostatus, HIV related sexual risk behaviors, reproductive outcomes, depressive symptoms, and adult sexual revictimization in 318 HIV-positive and 1077 HIV-negative African American (N=460), Latina (N=449), and European American (N=453) Los Angeles County women. The two studies contain a comparable assessment of child sexual abuse (CSA) experiences, HIV risks, and reproductive outcomes.

"Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to study and extend a general statistical methodology, called Targeted Empirical Learning, which includes a recently developed Targeted Maximum Likelihood methodology. The fundamental theoretical underpinnings of this new and unified approach to statistical learning have been developed and we propose to expand Targeted Empirical Learning into a practical product that can be applied to pressing scientific questions. Building on long-standing collaborations with leading scientists in the areas of clinical AIDS research, we will use this novel methodology to address research questions concerning HIV. Given observed data consisting of a realization of n independently and identically distributed random variables, Targeted Empirical Learning employs the following elements: i) defining the parameter of interest; 2) modeling the parameter of interest, leaving the nuisance parameters unspecified or only including truly known modeling assumptions; 3) developing targeted robust and highly efficient (maximum likelihood) estimators of the parameter of interest. The methodology relies on unified cross- validation to choose between competitive estimators indexed by, for example, choices of sieves parameterizations, algorithms, and/or dimension reductions (in particular for the nuisance parameters). Importantly, the cross-validation criterion employed evaluates the performance of these candidate estimators with respect to the parameter of interest. Specific applications to be addressed include the following: i) develop models and corresponding targeted empirical learners of optimal individualized treatment rules for treating HIV-infected patients, 2) estimate measures of variable importance/causal effects for mutations in the HIV virus for predicting clinical response to drug combinations; 3) estimate causal effects of adherence profiles on virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients.

"Targeted Learning using adaptive designs for HIV Epidemic control in East Africa PROJECT SUMMARY Scientific approaches to detect and respond to gaps in the public health response to HIV face a broad challenge with profound implications: after more than a decade of intensive service scale-up, the magnitude and reasons for remaining gaps in the treatment and prevention cascades differ markedly across people, communities, organizations, and geographies. As a result, strategies to control the epidemic must efficiently identify people and places most in need of intensified HIV testing, prevention, and treatment support, and deliver to each a timely and effective intervention. This poses a distinct scientific task: methods are required to discover and leverage continually evolving information to optimize “local” estimates of how best to allocate limited resources for both measurement and intervention. To meet this need, we propose a set of theoretical and applied aims that advance the use of adaptive designs– i.e. repeated “learn-and- apply” cycles– as a strategic approach for implementation science in heterogenous environments. Our approach uses four steps. First, we will extend existing statistical theory to allow machine learning to direct ongoing adaptation in who to measure and how to intervene, thereby creating approaches that maximally leverage the increasingly rich program data available in the HIV epidemic response. Second, we will use existing data from several unique field studies to create “virtual laboratories” for method validation and evaluation: 1) a sampling study to assess mortality on treatment in 64 facilities and 165,000 patients in Zambia; 2) an 1800-person individually randomized trial to optimize retention in HIV treatment in Kenya; and, 3) a cluster randomized trial of HIV treatment as prevention in 32 communities and 150,000 adults in Kenya and Uganda. Third, we will use these data to compare the methods developed against benchmarks provided by standard approaches (e.g. fixed sampling or balanced randomization). Fourth, we will develop accessible software for several general classes of problems in the HIV epidemic response and implementation science more broadly. Aim 1 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive sampling designs that target data gathering based on past information to better detect locations and subpopulations with elevated risk. Aim 2 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive designs that continuously target intervention assignment to learn how best to distribute interventions with heterogeneous effects. Aim 3 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive strategies that use past data to target combined data gathering and public health interventions to simultaneously discover regions of elevated risk and guide intervention decisions. Overall these methods offer the promise of detecting gaps in the HIV response more quickly, with fewer resources, and with fewer “missed signals”, and of intervening more effectively within a context of constrained resources by assigning interventions better tailored to individual and context-specific needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the current HIV epidemic response, high variability in implementing contexts and epidemic settings demands epidemiological designs and analytic methods that are able to detect and respond to heterogeneity effectively and efficiently. We propose a series of aims that leverage the rich data increasingly generated in the course of the HIV epidemic response, and apply targeted machine learning to advance adaptive design and analytic approaches. For each aim, we: 1) propose theoretical advancements to current adaptive design methods; 2) use large-scale contemporary data from the HIV epidemic in East Africa to build virtual analytic laboratories; 3) test the performance of the proposed innovations in these settings; and, 4) develop statistical software that can be implemented by applied epidemiologists to address real world problems.",Targeted Learning using adaptive designs for HIV Epidemic control in East Africa,9926564,R01AI074345,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Africa', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kenya', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Series', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uganda', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Zambia', 'analytical method', 'base', 'community organizations', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'trial design', 'virtual', 'virtual laboratory']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,613304,0.1555004622138824

Given the lack of knowledge regarding HIV testing in Voluntary' prison systems and the benefits of testing accrued by both infected inmates and communities to which inmates return, we propose to accomplish the following specific aims within the context of a large, southern state prison system: 1) determine system-wide and facility specific HIV testing rates among new prison entrants, 2) explore facility-specific differences associated with HIV testing rates, 3) identify inmate characteristics associated with receipt of an HIV test, and 4) identify inmate characteristics associated with positive serostatus. These aims will be achieved by analyzing a large (N=72,000) database using advanced statistical techniques including hierarchical multivariate modeling and principal components analysis.              n/a",Determinants of voluntary HIV testing among inmates,7254906,F30MH077546,"['Admission activity', 'African American', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'HIV', 'Health Status', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prisoner', 'Prisons', 'Process', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Southeastern United States', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'burden of illness', 'improved', 'systems research']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F30,2007,29575,0.19987764017768067
"NeuroAIDS in India    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NeuroAIDS in India Viral and host factors, as well as comorbidities, play key roles in determining susceptibility to the neurologic complications associated with HIV infection. Most studies of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment have been conducted in Western countries, where HIV clade B predominates. Worldwide, however, clade C is much more common and recent virologic studies suggest that its neurovirulence may differ from clade B. Approximately 5 million individuals are infected with HIV in India, the vast majority with clade C virus. In the present study we will address the following aims within an Indian cohort: 1) to determine the prevalence and nature of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HNCI) in HIV-infected individuals who are not on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, 2) to determine the impact of newly-initiated ARV treatment on cognitive functioning, 3) to assess the viral (env, tat) genetics associated with HNCI, and 4) to determine the relationship between HNCI and host immunogenetic factors (i.e., genotype MCP-1, CCL3L1 copy number, RANTES and polymorphisms in CCR5/CCR2 to define CCR5 haplotypes). Building upon collaboration between the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) in the U.S. and the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, India, we propose to examine 300 HIV+ individuals prior to initiation of ARVs in linked studies (HPTN 052, India National AIDS Control Organization program) and follow them annually thereafter. We will also enroll an HIV seronegative comparison group in order to establish neuropsychological norms for determining impairment in individual HIV+ persons. The feasibility of this study has been demonstrated by a pilot study in which we created Marathi-translated instruments, trained India personnel, and examined 60 participants using methods originally developed at the HNRC but adapted to India.

"Predicting Brain Changes in HIV/AIDS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In affluent countries where combination anti-retroviral therapy (CART) is widely used, life expectancy with HIV has increased well beyond 10 years, but this has greatly increased the number of people living with HIV/AIDS. 40 million people are now at risk for progressive HIV-related damage to the brain (Navia 2011), and 40% show some neurological or cognitive impairment. Building on our recent discoveries and innovations in MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, our project charts the dynamics of HIV disease in the brain, revealing factors that predict clinical decline and brain decline. By analyzing data from the HIVNC (HIV Neuroimaging Consortium) cohort (218 HIV+ subjects scanned longitudinally with MRI every 26-32 weeks for 3 years; 900 scans), we will use our sensitive image analysis method, tensor-based morphometry to (1) map rates of brain tissue loss over time, determining which brain systems lose tissue fastest; (2) relate these loss patterns to neurocognitive impairment (NCI); and (3) determine which host and disease-related factors, at baseline, predict higher atrophic rates over the 3-year follow-up interval. To deeply probe the causes of dysfunction, we will use whole-brain tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging in 267 subjects to determine where HIV+ patients have reduced fiber integrity. We will use each patient's DTI scan to compute a whole-brain connection matrix, based on a state-of-the-art whole-brain tractography method we developed. We will combine the best neuroimaging measures from Aims 1 and 2 into our support vector machine method to predict (1) future rates of atrophy, and (2) cognitive decline over the 3-year follow-up. With our best predictors of decline from Aims 1 and 2, we will predict which HIV+ patients will show imminent decline. We will estimate the sample sizes needed for a neuroimaging-based drug trial to detect a 5%, 10%, or 25% slowing in the rate of atrophy, and the same percents of slowing in the rate of cognitive decline. We will test whether our predictors generalize to the large, independent Charter and Miriam datasets beyond HIVNC (see Support Letters from Drs. Igor Grant and Ron Cohen), and when used by our many HIV research collaborators now using our methods; see Pilot Data). As shown in new pilot data, we assess how imaging protocol differences affect the measures; our innovations to reduce scan protocol confounds (e.g., adjusted FA) will guide selection of the most robust predictors. We will evaluate how useful these new measures are for predicting cognitive decline, and boosting power in an antiretroviral drug trial. In other words, to what extent can a DTI scan, and an MRI-based map of atrophy, help to make clinical predictions of imminent cognitive impairment? Can they help select a sample for a drug trial? Our activities will make clinical trial design more efficient by selecting subjects with greater potential to respond t future therapies. As always, we will disseminate our methods to both experts and trainees in medicine, neuroscience, engineering, and to our network of over 100 collaborating labs (including two national HIV consortia: HIVNC, CHARTER, and the Miriam HIV cohort), to accelerate their work.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on our recent discoveries, this project greatly advances our ability to map, and predict, brain changes in people living with HIV/AIDS.

"Predicting Brain Changes in HIV/AIDS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In affluent countries where combination anti-retroviral therapy (CART) is widely used, life expectancy with HIV has increased well beyond 10 years, but this has greatly increased the number of people living with HIV/AIDS. 40 million people are now at risk for progressive HIV-related damage to the brain (Navia 2011), and 40% show some neurological or cognitive impairment. Building on our recent discoveries and innovations in MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, our project charts the dynamics of HIV disease in the brain, revealing factors that predict clinical decline and brain decline. By analyzing data from the HIVNC (HIV Neuroimaging Consortium) cohort (218 HIV+ subjects scanned longitudinally with MRI every 26-32 weeks for 3 years; 900 scans), we will use our sensitive image analysis method, tensor-based morphometry to (1) map rates of brain tissue loss over time, determining which brain systems lose tissue fastest; (2) relate these loss patterns to neurocognitive impairment (NCI); and (3) determine which host and disease-related factors, at baseline, predict higher atrophic rates over the 3-year follow-up interval. To deeply probe the causes of dysfunction, we will use whole-brain tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging in 267 subjects to determine where HIV+ patients have reduced fiber integrity. We will use each patient's DTI scan to compute a whole-brain connection matrix, based on a state-of-the-art whole-brain tractography method we developed. We will combine the best neuroimaging measures from Aims 1 and 2 into our support vector machine method to predict (1) future rates of atrophy, and (2) cognitive decline over the 3-year follow-up. With our best predictors of decline from Aims 1 and 2, we will predict which HIV+ patients will show imminent decline. We will estimate the sample sizes needed for a neuroimaging-based drug trial to detect a 5%, 10%, or 25% slowing in the rate of atrophy, and the same percents of slowing in the rate of cognitive decline. We will test whether our predictors generalize to the large, independent Charter and Miriam datasets beyond HIVNC (see Support Letters from Drs. Igor Grant and Ron Cohen), and when used by our many HIV research collaborators now using our methods; see Pilot Data). As shown in new pilot data, we assess how imaging protocol differences affect the measures; our innovations to reduce scan protocol confounds (e.g., adjusted FA) will guide selection of the most robust predictors. We will evaluate how useful these new measures are for predicting cognitive decline, and boosting power in an antiretroviral drug trial. In other words, to what extent can a DTI scan, and an MRI-based map of atrophy, help to make clinical predictions of imminent cognitive impairment? Can they help select a sample for a drug trial? Our activities will make clinical trial design more efficient by selecting subjects with greater potential to respond t future therapies. As always, we will disseminate our methods to both experts and trainees in medicine, neuroscience, engineering, and to our network of over 100 collaborating labs (including two national HIV consortia: HIVNC, CHARTER, and the Miriam HIV cohort), to accelerate their work.

"HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Archive for Developing Countries (HAPPA-DEV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has shown that HIV/AIDS prevention programs can have a significant impact on reducing HIV risk behaviors among adults and youth in the U.S. Sociometrics has made several dozen of the most promising U.S. HIV/AIDS prevention programs publicly available through two widely-used topically-focused archives: the HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Archive (HAPPA, adult-focused programs) and the Program Archive on Sexuality, Health, and Adolescence (PASHA, youth-focused programs).       No similar resources exist for use in schools, clinics, and community-based organizations in developing countries. Sociometrics proposes to fill this gap by creating HAPPA-DEV (HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Archive for Developing Countries). HAPPA-DEV will draw on the successful development strategies used by HAPPA and PASHA. Programs will be selected for HAPPA-DEV by a Scientist Expert Panel based on the strength of the evidence for their effectiveness and their replicability. Each replication kit in HAPPA-DEV will contain all the materials that a new site would need to replicate the effective program. In addition, three innovations will be added to HAPPA-DEV: (1) Each HAPPA-DEV replication kit will contain a program adaptation workbook to enhance the ability of archive users to tailor effective behavioral programs to new target populations and contexts. (2) Each HAPPA-DEV replication kit will be digitized to promote cost- effective and widespread, worldwide dissemination. (3) Accompanying the HAPPA-DEV collection will be a Program LOCator and USage Tool (LOCUS) that will include: (3a) an electronic search tool to locate programs that match a given site's target population, goals and desired approaches; as well as (3b) a multimedia introduction to each program in the archive that summarizes each program's goals, approach and features, and that gives program usage and implementation tips. A printed version of LOCUS will be developed for users with no or limited access to computers.       During Phase I of the project, we will conduct an extensive literature search to identify programs that have demonstrated positive impact on HIV-related risk behavior in developing countries and work with a Scientist Expert Panel to select efficacious and replicable programs for eventual public distribution. We will obtain Letters of Support from selected original developers affirming their willingness to work with us in Phase II on making their program available for public distribution. We will acquire the program materials for one selected effective program and work with the developer of the program to create both original language and English versions of the prototype package, in both print and digitized formats. The package will include a program adaptation workbook. We will also develop a prototype for LOCUS. The HAPPA-DEV and LOCUS prototypes will be subjected to usability testing with testers drawn from diverse regions of the world, especially those regions that will be contributing effective programs to HAPPA-DEV.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed archive will facilitate access to, and dissemination of, HIV primary and secondary prevention programs that science has shown to be effective in at least one developing country. By promoting the use of effective programs, HAPPA-DEV should help reduce sexual and drug-related behaviors that put individuals at risk of acquiring HIV, thus promoting global public health.          n/a",HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Archive for Developing Countries (HAPPA-DEV),7530113,R43MH082675,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'English Language', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Individual', 'International', 'Letters', 'Mediation', 'Multimedia', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention Research', 'Prevention intervention', 'Prevention program', 'Printing', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sexuality', 'Site', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost effective', 'desire', 'innovation', 'interest', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'usability', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,SOCIOMETRICS CORPORATION,R43,2008,37327,0.07866257658500277

"A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens on earth. In fact, some coding regions, such as envelope, can have more than 30% genetic difference between clades. The neurocognitive effects of clade B HIV-1 infection have been well characterized in the developed world; however, there continues to be controversy surronding the effect of non-clade B infection on the neurocognitive functioning. The overarching aims of the proposed study is to 1) characterize and compare the burden of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurring among individuals living in Brazil, China, India, Romania and the United States and infected with CRF01_AE and clades B, C and F, and 2) evaluate the neurovirulent and neurotropic genotypic determinants between subtypes. Important research questions that remain unanswered include: How do the prevalence, nature and course of HAND in various parts of the world compare when analyzed by population and subtype? What specific viral genetic characteristics are associated with neurovirulence and seeding of the central nervous system (CNS)?    The current proposal is designed to systematically address these issues by: 1) determining the differential effect of HIV subtype on neurocognitive performance by measuring HAND using standardized measures in previously established cohorts in Brazil (clades B and C), China (CRF01_AE and clades B and C), India (clade C), Romania (clade F) and the United States (clade B), 2) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during HAND by subtype and by study population by performing clade-typing of study participants by generating population based sequences of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA and DNA extracted from blood, and 3) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during CNS compartmentalization between clades B and C by performing clonal sequencing of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA extracted from paired blood and CSF samples collected from participants with clade B or C infection in Brazil, India and the United States. The comparison of the burden of HAND between groups infected with different HIV clades requires standardized procedures for the measurement of HAND within and across populations. Investigations into clade-specific genotypic determinants of HIV neuropathogenesis and neurotropism requires: 1) well-characterized study populations and biologic samples from study participants, 2) standardization of measurements of neurocognitive functioning, 3) high quality HIV RNA sequencing capability in all research study settings, 4) secure and reliable data management and communication capabilities for sequence and study data between participating sites, and 5) expertise in state-of- the-art genotypic analysis.

"A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognitive Impairm    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens on earth. In fact, some coding regions, such as envelope, can have more than 30% genetic difference between clades. The neurocognitive effects of clade B HIV-1 infection have been well characterized in the developed world; however, there continues to be controversy surronding the effect of non-clade B infection on the neurocognitive functioning. The overarching aims of the proposed study is to 1) characterize and compare the burden of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurring among individuals living in Brazil, China, India, Romania and the United States and infected with CRF01_AE and clades B, C and F, and 2) evaluate the neurovirulent and neurotropic genotypic determinants between subtypes. Important research questions that remain unanswered include: How do the prevalence, nature and course of HAND in various parts of the world compare when analyzed by population and subtype? What specific viral genetic characteristics are associated with neurovirulence and seeding of the central nervous system (CNS)?    The current proposal is designed to systematically address these issues by: 1) determining the differential effect of HIV subtype on neurocognitive performance by measuring HAND using standardized measures in previously established cohorts in Brazil (clades B and C), China (CRF01_AE and clades B and C), India (clade C), Romania (clade F) and the United States (clade B), 2) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during HAND by subtype and by study population by performing clade-typing of study participants by generating population based sequences of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA and DNA extracted from blood, and 3) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during CNS compartmentalization between clades B and C by performing clonal sequencing of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA extracted from paired blood and CSF samples collected from participants with clade B or C infection in Brazil, India and the United States. The comparison of the burden of HAND between groups infected with different HIV clades requires standardized procedures for the measurement of HAND within and across populations.

"Reconstructing HIV Epidemics from HIV Phylogenetics Project Summary HIV continues to spread, episodically, among minority groups, and mostly from people unaware of their infection. To more efficiently locate undiagnosed people living with HIV for treatment, as well as to monitor prevention efforts, better epidemiological techniques are needed. Our project brings together a team of experienced researchers from clinical, molecular biology, epidemiological, mathematical, and evolutionary fields. We will develop innovative epidemiological methods by combining evolutionary theory, multi-scale dynamic modeling, artificial intelligence, and large-scale clinical and sequence data. In this renewal, we will expand on our previous work on how HIV within-host evolutionary processes interact with epidemiological dynamics. Having quantified the link between transmission history and the resulting HIV phylogeny among hosts, we conceptualize the relationship between the evolution and epidemiology of HIV into three levels: within-host, at transmission, and on the population epidemic level. Because essential processes of HIV biology and evolution have been largely ignored when modeling the epidemic level, in aim 1 we examine within-host processes that affect diversification. We will include recombination, selection, and latency in a new coalescent within-host model to evaluate the impact on the epidemiological level. We will also quantify potential within- host multi-directional selection pressures. In aim 2, we focus on mechanisms that occur around the time of transmission. We will develop a new maximum likelihood method based on a forward-time probabilistic model of transmission that improves the inference of transmission direction and time of transmission among multiple hosts, and develop a transmission heterogeneity detection method to both assess overall possible transmission heterogeneity among infected persons, as well as to detect where in a phylogeny super- spreading may have occurred. In aim 3, we will develop machine learning methods to handle very large data sets (103-106 patients), and use additional clinical and demographic data to augment phylogenies in order to reconstruct the underlying transmission history. All three aims will involve advancements aimed at developing and improving methods for the next generation of phylodynamic applications. Narrative Combining evolutionary theory, multi-scale dynamic modeling, and large-scale clinical and sequence data will transform how epidemics are investigated and prevented. Melding these resources, we will develop innovative methods for HIV epidemiological analyses and prevention efforts.",Reconstructing HIV Epidemics from HIV Phylogenetics,10160559,R01AI087520,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Guide prevention', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Work', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multi-scale modeling', 'next generation', 'next generation sequence data', 'pathogen', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"TRIAD NATIONAL SECURITY, LLC",R01,2020,906886,0.16281707052131755
"Routinizing HIV testing for Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will aim to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using state-of-the-art social media and game technology to increase HIV testing among adolescents and young adults (AYA) ages 13-24. Rates of HIV testing among AYA are low, resulting in high proportions of AYA who are positive or unaware of their HIV infection. Further, public health messages which can be effective in older adults do not achieve the same results in AYA. Since many AYA are highly engaged with social media and games, these technologies may hold the key to reaching this population. While previous behavior change games have shown positive results by using the compelling nature of gameplay to make health education entertaining and shift attitudes towards disease prevention, this intervention proposes to incorporate a new innovation which changes the way video games are used to increase HIV testing and linkage to care. The intended result is a novel social media experience which plays like a game while prompting dialogue about HIV risk assessment, testing, and linkage to care-- in a population more interested in dialogue than in hearing one-way health promotion messages. We hypothesize that the intended result will be both a marketable product and an effective, evidence-based behavioral intervention that increases access to and uptake of HIV testing and linkage to care among AYA. Our multidisciplinary team will recruit AYA to assist in informing the development of a prototype social media game accessible from smartphones, tablets, and the Web. The intervention will be developed with input from AYA, as well as health care providers, to increase acceptability and conduct feasibility testing and revisions to increase game performance and acceptability. During a 6-month period, we will work with AYA to assess the acceptability of the game and its potential impact on perceptions of HIV risk, prevention and testing; perceptions regarding barriers to testing and linkage to care, changes in motivation and readiness to test, and increased self-efficacy regarding health promotion and HIV prevention. We anticipate the results will demonstrate feasibility and provide data to inform a Phase II study to test the efficacy of the game on increasing testing and linkage to care through a larger randomized controlled trial as well as provide a more significant level of feedback on playability, art and animation styles, player engagement, and overall acceptability. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate how this product may advance the effective implementation of an evidence-based behavioral intervention for increased testing and linkage to care among youth. Successful development of this core technology could also be revised to be applicable to other medical conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the feasibility and acceptability of linking young people to HIV testing and care services through social media gameplay. The project focuses on the development of an innovative, culturally-appropriate and youth-appropriate game to help players assess their personal HIV risk through engaging, personalized gameplay. The game rewards players for HIV testing and linkage to care, and sharing the game with others via social networks.        ",Routinizing HIV testing for Adolescents,9147193,R43HD088332,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Chlamydia', 'Choice Behavior', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gonorrhea', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Program Development', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Readiness', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Perception', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Surveys', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Video Games', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'animation', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health belief', 'high risk behavior', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research and development', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'social media', 'surveillance data', 'uptake']",NICHD,"MEDIA REZ, LLC",R43,2016,224278,0.1773703059221478
"Quantifying risk from and appropriate recipients for infectious-risk kidneys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost 9% of deceased donors in the United States are classified by the CDC as ""high risk for transmission of HIV"" based on a set of behavioral criteria introduced in 1985 and formalized in 1994. When these criteria were originally developed, they were based on estimates of prevalent HIV disease, and the CDC recommended that organs not be used from Infectious Risk Donors (IRDs) except in extenuating circumstances. However, with significant advances in viral testing, the risks are much lower, the diseases of concern have changed, and the original behavioral criteria are less relevant to the predictions required for clinical decision-making than they were in 1985 and 1994. As a result, discard rates for IRD kidneys are significantly higher than their non-IRD counterparts despite good outcomes in those who do receive them.  The central problem is that selecting a recipient that will benefit from an IRD kidney is difficult. First, no systematic estimates of the risk of undetected HIV or hepatitis C (HCV) with various IRD behaviors exist, so clinical decision-making is based more on intuition and anecdote than on evidence. Second, no studies exist that compare, in a given patient, the risk of death while waiting for a better kidney offer with the risk of undetected viral infection from IRDs. We hypothesize that subgroups of patients exist for whom the risks of dialysis while waiting for a better kidney offer far exceed the risks of HIV or HCV transmission from IRDs, and that defining this subgroup will increase comfort with and utilization of IRDs. This seems to be a concept intuitive to transplant surgeons, as identification of a target recipient profile was associated with significantly higher likelihood of using kidneys from IRDs in a national survey.  In an effort to inform and improve utilization of IRD kidneys, we propose to systematically review the literature on incidence of HIV and HCV seroconversion in various behavioral risk groups, estimate the predicted probabilities of HIV and HCV transmission in IRDs, and design a Markov decision process model for identifying the recipients who are likely to benefit significantly from IRD kidneys compared with waiting on dialysis.  The research described in this proposal will directly address, through a novel mathematical approach, a critical clinical need. A successful Markov decision process model will be immediately useable clinically throughout the country, and will with high likelihood increase provider comfort with kidneys from a currently underutilized subgroup of deceased donors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although kidney transplantation offers potentially significant benefit to the tens of thousands of patients on the waiting list, there is reluctance to use kidneys from almost 10% of donors who, based on studies of behavioral risk from over 20 years ago, are flagged as having increased (although still very low) risk of carrying HIV. Because the risk of death on the waiting list is now so high, we suspect that, for some patients, the risk of transmitting an undetected infection from these donors is much lower than the risk of dying while waiting for a better kidney. The goal of this project is to update the antiquated behavioral risk flags, quantify the true risk associated with these donors, and use novel mathematical methods to identify patients who will benefit from kidney transplants from this underutilized supply of donors.           Public Health Relevance Although kidney transplantation offers potentially significant benefit to the tens of thousands of patients on the waiting list, there is reluctance to use kidneys from almost 10% of donors who, based on studies of behavioral risk from over 20 years ago, are flagged as having increased (although still very low) risk of carrying HIV.

"Long Term Effects of Chronic HIV Infection on the Developing Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 application builds upon a successful R21 grant that examined a cohort of Romanian adolescents and young adults who are long-term HIV survivors and who, despite over a decade of effective treatment, still demonstrate neuropsychological impairments (approx. 50% of subjects).

The key feature of the next stage of this study is that these late teens and early 20s HIV+ cases, who were parenterally infected a long time ago, and for whom we have extensive longitudinal biological and treatment information, may experience altered maturation of the brain, with possible neurocognitive and social cognition sequelae. Prior to 1989, only 13 AIDS cases from Romania had been reported to the WHO, while by the end of 1990, 1168 cases were reported, of which 1094 were in children less than 13 years of age.

"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention.

"High throughput high resolution profiling of antibody specificities of polyclonal     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV elicits the production of antibodies in the infected individual. Whereas for most, this response is highly specific for the particular viral isolate of infection, there are some individuals that mount broadly cross neutralizing antibodies that appear to keep the virus in check. It is assumed that such cross neutralizing activity is central i combating AIDS and would be a necessary attribute of a prophylactic AIDS vaccine. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to critically analyze the antibody response towards HIV and profile the specificities correlated with virus neutralization. Current serological methods, however, are tedious, laborious and of unsatisfactory resolution, classifying antibody specificities to gross chunks of the HIV envelope. Here we propose a novel and much improved technological platform that generates exceptionally high resolution profiles of the antibody specificities of polyclonal serum with relative ease, low cost and at high throughput. The essence of the technology is the combination of two new methods; a phage display library of a comprehensive array of HIV envelope peptides/domains ranging in length from 50 to 300 amino acids, and a unique vector system that converts phage display compatible with second generation DNA cyclic sequencing. Together, this methodology, coined Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, enables one to analyze the complete antibody repertoire of selected polyclonal sera. The data output generated consists of hundreds of thousands of affinity isolated peptides corresponding to HIV envelope segments. In this study feasibility of the methods and evaluation of their utility and productivity will be tested using a panel of >400 well characterize serum samples of HIV infected individuals that range in their neutralizing capacity from non-existent/weak to extraordinarily potent (top 2% of the collection). Selected sera will be subjected to Deep Panning and the data sets to be generated will be classified implementing machine learning computational methods. These will produce a profile of those epitopes that best correlate with HIV neutralization. It is proposed that this information will be extremely useful fo our understanding of mechanisms of HIV neutralization and as guides to rational vaccine design. Moreover, the proof of feasibility in this pilot study will serve as the basis for more elaborate and comprehensive studies targeted to better understand HIV correlates of immunity, disease progression and prevention of AIDS.          A comprehensive panel of polyclonal sera of HIV infected individuals will be analyzed by Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, a novel methodology that generates high resolution profiles of antibody specificities. Specific focus will be on elucidation of the correlates of HIV neutralization and association of this activity to specific epitopes of the viral envelope.

"High throughput high resolution profiling of antibody specificities of polyclonal     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV elicits the production of antibodies in the infected individual. Whereas for most, this response is highly specific for the particular viral isolate of infection, there are some individuals that mount broadly cross neutralizing antibodies that appear to keep the virus in check. It is assumed that such cross neutralizing activity is central i combating AIDS and would be a necessary attribute of a prophylactic AIDS vaccine. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to critically analyze the antibody response towards HIV and profile the specificities correlated with virus neutralization. Current serological methods, however, are tedious, laborious and of unsatisfactory resolution, classifying antibody specificities to gross chunks of the HIV envelope. Here we propose a novel and much improved technological platform that generates exceptionally high resolution profiles of the antibody specificities of polyclonal serum with relative ease, low cost and at high throughput. The essence of the technology is the combination of two new methods; a phage display library of a comprehensive array of HIV envelope peptides/domains ranging in length from 50 to 300 amino acids, and a unique vector system that converts phage display compatible with second generation DNA cyclic sequencing. Together, this methodology, coined Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, enables one to analyze the complete antibody repertoire of selected polyclonal sera. The data output generated consists of hundreds of thousands of affinity isolated peptides corresponding to HIV envelope segments. In this study feasibility of the methods and evaluation of their utility and productivity will be tested using a panel of >400 well characterize serum samples of HIV infected individuals that range in their neutralizing capacity from non-existent/weak to extraordinarily potent (top 2% of the collection). Selected sera will be subjected to Deep Panning and the data sets to be generated will be classified implementing machine learning computational methods. These will produce a profile of those epitopes that best correlate with HIV neutralization. It is proposed that this information will be extremely useful fo our understanding of mechanisms of HIV neutralization and as guides to rational vaccine design. Moreover, the proof of feasibility in this pilot study will serve as the basis for more elaborate and comprehensive studies targeted to better understand HIV correlates of immunity, disease progression and prevention of AIDS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A comprehensive panel of polyclonal sera of HIV infected individuals will be analyzed by Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, a novel methodology that generates high resolution profiles of antibody specificities. Specific focus will be on elucidation of the correlates of HIV neutralization and association of this activity to specific epitopes of the viral envelope. The discovery of these correlates of virus neutralization will be useful for rational design of AIDS vaccines and better understanding of disease progression and prevention.              A comprehensive panel of polyclonal sera of HIV infected individuals will be analyzed by Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, a novel methodology that generates high resolution profiles of antibody specificities.

"A Model System for HIV Multi-Drug Therapy Design  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinically effective inhibitors of the HIV protease are generally considered major successes in structure-based drug design. Despite these successes, a cure for AIDS has remained elusive. This is due to the rapid evolution of HIV in the host and the emergence of drug resistance. Continued target identification and drug design will be an important, ongoing effort, yet probably will not result in a definitive therapy against the HIV-1 virus. For viruses that rapidly develop resistance pathways, the rational design of multi-drug therapy becomes an increasingly pressing goal. The present work seeks to explore strategies for multi-drug therapies using a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches. A simple experimental model system will be created for exploring multidrug resistance in a high-throughput manner. This model system involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) random mutagenesis and coexpression of the HIV protease, apoptotic Bax protein and beta-galactosidase in E. coli. In this system, Bax protein can be used to efficiently mimic HIV vitality testing and beta-galactosidase provides a colorimetric assay for screening protease activity in vivo. The rate of mutation can be adjusted in PCR mutagenesis and a low mutation rate will be used to provide a dense, local exploration of sequence space. With the aid of this experimental system, a bioinformatics tool will be developed to predict drug resistance from protein sequence information. This uses a linear transformation model along with a position-specific scoring system. This tool is used to create a ""vector space"" model of drug efficacy. This model uses methods similar to principal component analysis to calculate orthogonal vectors in ""drug efficacy space"". These vectors are used to determine proportions in drug cocktails. The hypothesis is that a sequential application of these cocktails will span the vector space and, therefore, be the best possible therapy given these available drugs. The model system will be used in an iterative manner to test the multidrug therapy strategy and to refine the parameters of the computational tools.

"The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV ABSTRACT For the first time on a national level, we propose to utilize routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa in a way that is uniquely robust to transfer across facilities. South Africa is home to more people living with HIV than any other country, and nearly one in three pregnant women attending antenatal care is living with HIV. Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased substantially since the start of the national ART program in 2004, with >95% ART coverage during pregnancy and delivery, and mother-to-child transmission of HIV greatly reduced. However, our work has demonstrated that women who initiate ART during pregnancy are at heightened risk of dropping out of care, particularly after delivery, leading to the potential for viral transmission, morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to evaluate the success of policies of expanded access to ART care, and assess continuity of care, due to the lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. In addition, patient movement between unlinked facilities means that self-transfer often is misclassified as loss to care. To address this major shortcoming, our team at the Health Economics and Epidemiology Office (HE2RO) partnered with the South African National Health Laboratory Services in 2015 to use existing HIV-related laboratory data to create the South African National HIV Cohort. Now, through this five-year award, we propose to expand this successful project to use routinely- collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa. We propose three specific aims. First, we will develop and validate a novel national cohort of pregnant women accessing HIV care. Using laboratory test data matched to facility type, we will identify entry to antenatal care to build the cohort, then describe key treatment milestones, including 1) engagement in antenatal care, 2) initiation of ART, 3) HIV viremia, and 4) continuity of HIV care in the postpartum period. Second, we will measure the effect of system-wide factors impacting continuity of care among pregnant women. We will assess policies of expanded treatment access on continuity of care using regression-discontinuity analyses. We then will assess mobility and its effect on continuity of care during and after pregnancy. Third, we will identify individual-level risk factors for loss from HIV care in order to develop targeted interventions to improve engagement in HIV care.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Women who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy in South Africa are at high risk of dropping out of care – particularly after delivery – but efforts to evaluate continuity of HIV care among pregnant and postpartum women have been hampered by lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. Through this five-year award, we propose to use routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a national cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa that is uniquely robust to patient transfer. This novel cohort of pregnant women will be a powerful tool available to policymakers, clinicians and researchers for improving our understanding of engagement in care among pregnant women in South Africa and assessing the performance of the South African national ART program in caring for pregnant women living with HIV.",The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV,9984567,R01HD103466,"['Address', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Feeding', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drops', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'High Risk Woman', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mother-to-child HIV transmission', 'Movement', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Public Sector', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'antenatal care', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'cohort', 'data tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient mobility', 'postpartum care', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NICHD,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",R01,2020,192033,0.1547507230603872
"Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for nearly two-thirds all of new HIV infections in the United States (US) and young MSM (YMSM) are the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence. Among youth, 67 percent report not disclosing to their first time sex partners.4 Disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved medication adherence and retention in care. Those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners5 and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%.6,7 Further, disclosure may motivate uninfected sex partners to seek testing and reduce their own HIV transmission behaviors. Given the potential benefits and challenges associated with disclosure, there is a need for sophisticated interventions that can assist MSM, with the disclosure process. Virtual reality provides a unique environment for users to practice HIV disclosure. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven disclosure may offer advantages over in-person role play through the use of realistic avatars that represent potential romantic partners, and probabilistic settings where users envision having disclosure conversations. Users have the opportunity to practice disclosing and experience a variety of responses and outcomes. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system that features three avatars, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM. In Phase II we will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature automated version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through the newly created Center for Innovative Technologies (iTech) across the Prevention and Care Continuum, an NIH-funded center to support adolescent HIV research. The aims of this Phase II SBIR are: 1) Refine and enhance the current Tough Talks disclosure scenarios to include additional content, characters and virtual environments. Formative work with YMSM (aged 16-29 years) will inform development and we will work with a leader in AI software to incorporate natural language into the AI driven scenarios; 2) Develop the Tough Talks stand-alone intervention. This fully automated intervention will include the AI driven disclosure scenarios created in aim 1 as well as a virtual disclosure coach to guide participants through the intervention goal-setting interactive exercises and interactive educational videos. Following development, a technical pilot to optimize functionality and technical performance will be conducted with 8-10 YMSM and; 3) Conduct a three-arm combined efficacy/effectiveness trial to compare the intervention delivered online (Arm 1) versus in the clinic (Arm 2) compared to standard of care (SOC) disclosure messaging only. Primary outcomes of HIV viral load and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) will be assessed at intervention completion (1 month) and at 6-month follow-up. We will estimate transmissions averted and program costs of each arm (Months 19-36). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite monumental advances in HIV treatment and prevention technologies, disclosing a positive HIV status to an intimate partner remains a daunting and a complex undertaking. However, those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%. Further, disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved retention in care, antiretroviral adherence and decreased viral load.

"Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION: Surveillance estimates indicate an alarming resurgence of new HIV/AIDS cases among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), highlighting the importance of re-examining prevention modalities and behavior change strategies. After diagnosis, persons living with HIV continue to engage in sexual and drug use behaviors that increase the risk for transmission of HIV. By continuing to engage in unprotected sex, HIV+ YMSM put themselves at risk of transmitting HIV to their partners, becoming re-infected with another strain of HIV, and/or acquiring other STIs. Individuals who communicate with sex partners about condom use and sexual health topics, including disclosure of HIV status, have been found to be more likely to engage in condom use behaviors. However, disclosure represents a challenging situation which is a universal and recurrent stressor in the lives of HIV+ persons. Despite being recognized as a critical component of prevention interventions directed at MSM, there is currently no stand-alone, easily delivered disclosure intervention. Moreover, there is a need to design interventions that engage the targeted population without the requirement of extensive training of facilitators who traditionally provide in person role plays, a method that will always e limited by lack of availability and scalability. Developing an ecologically relevant, artificially intelligent (AI) technology tool to offer the opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill implementation, in a safe and engaging manner, is highly innovative, relevant and needed. This tool would be able to address the context (e.g., the emotionally charged experience of disclosure), content (the highly stigmatizing nature of an HIV diagnosis), and possible consequences (both positive and negative). Such a tool offers the added benefit of constant availability for the user to practice and receive feedback for each trial of practice while providig the possibility of a rewarding and reinforcing technology that shapes targeted behaviors to be more effective. The central goal of this proposal, titled, ""Tough Talks: A disclosure intervention for HIV+ YMSM,"" is to create a safe, internet-delivered software program that will offer intelligen virtual character-driven scenarios that are engaging, interactive, ecologically sensitive, and user-centric in content and design, all focused on increasing mastery of important skills associated with disclosure of HIV status. In Phase I, Tough Talks will be a novel prevention tool that will address sexual health communication with sex partners in the context of addressing disclosure of HIV status. If this paradigm is successful, this intervention would represent a highl customizable solution that could be expanded to address HIV disclosure among MSM to family and friends or adapted to deal with disclosure among other HIV infected populations or for other contagious and/or stigmatizing conditions where disclosure is challenging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing sexual risk among HIV-infected YMSM, the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence, begins with negotiation of safer sex behaviors with current and potential sex partners. Individuals who can communicate with sex partners about sexual health topics, including disclosure of HIV status, are more likely to engage in condom use behaviors. Therefore, HIV status disclosure represents an important underdeveloped public health strategy to address ongoing sexual risk behaviors.

"Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as ""Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd)"" and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lea to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients.

"Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as ""Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd)"" and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells.

"The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) has the ability to enter a long-lived dormant state, termed proviral latency. Proviral latency is the primay barrier to eradication of HIV-1 from infected individuals, owing to viral reactivation from reservoirs of latently infected cells upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment. It is known tht HIV-1 transcription significantly influences the regulation of HIV-1 latency. The proposed research will utilize high-throughput single-cell measurements to quantify modulated HIV-1 gene expression. A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8762403,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hexamethylene Bisacetamide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Probability', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Virus', 'Vorinostat', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'drug mechanism', 'high standard', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'purge', 'reactivation from latency', 'tool']",NIAID,J.

A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.            ",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8467574,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Hexamethylene Bisacetamide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Probability', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Virus', 'Vorinostat', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'drug mechanism', 'high standard', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'reactivation from latency', 'tool']",NIAID,J.

"Semi-Automated Processing of Interconnected Dyads Using Entity Resolution (SPIDER) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching aim of this proposal is to develop and verify a new and innovative software system that will assist researchers in more rigorously constructing social networks. During the past two decades, studies have increasingly employed social network analysis (SNA) to understand HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) transmission. The mapping of ""risk networks,"" in which individuals are connected by infection-spreading ties, has yielded especially valuable insight into the behavioral epidemiology of HIV and STI, and has informed promising interventions designed for people at risk for or living with HIV. However, despite these advances and the burgeoning popularity of SNA-based HIV/STI research, major methodological and technological challenges are hindering further progress in the field. SNA's ability to catalyze major epidemiologic advances relies on researchers' ability to construct valid representations of participants' networks from behavioral data. The standard protocol for constructing risk networks, or identifying direct and indirect relationships among participants and their partners, involves matching participants' names and demographics with data provided about named partners. This process of identifying and matching duplicate individuals in the network (i.e., ""entity resolution"" [ER]) is often conducted through laborious, manual cross-referencing procedures. These procedures are limited in their reproducibility and may lead to misspecification of network structure. Further complicating valid network construction is that ER criteria are: (1) not formalized; (2) specified differently across studies n various settings and populations; and (3) rarely, if ever, explained in the published literature. Semi-automated tools that combine powerful automated ER processes with capacities for customization and qualitative input have the potential to dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of risk network construction. Current tools for ER in health research tend to focus on a static subset of available ER techniques (e.g., similarity in demographics, phonetic-based matching techniques) without incorporating state- of-the-art approaches (e.g., machine learning). The proposed software, Semi-automated Processing of Interconnected Dyads using Entity Resolution (SPIDER), will provide users with a system that enables efficient, semi-automated network construction using a library of robust, statistically rigorous ER algorithms, rich desktop-based annotation tools, and secure web-based technologies. The customizability of SPIDER will allow for multi-disciplinary utility in studies using varying designs and will include innovative features that specifically respond to emerging methodological trends in HIV/STI research. The overarching goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and quality of network construction used in research, thereby improving the evidence base for network-based interventions that mitigate the spread of HIV.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching aim of this Phase I proposal is to develop and verify a software system that will assist researchers, interventionists, and practitioners in more rigorously constructing social networks. The software, Semi-Automated Processing of Interconnected Dyads Using Entity Resolution (SPIDER), will provide users with a system that enables efficient, semi-automated risk network construction using a library of robust, advanced entity resolution algorithms, rich desktop-based annotation tools, secure web-based technologies, and a host of innovative features that specifically respond to emerging methodological trends in HIV/STI research.

"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing.

"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9319810,R01MH109320,"['Adherence', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Fumarates', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Ingestion', 'Injectable', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phonation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Spottings', 'Technology', 'Tenofovir', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'diaries', 'efficacy trial', 'emtricitabine', 'forgetting', 'high risk', 'high risk men', 'improved', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'pill', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sex risk', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'volunteer', 'young man', 'young men who have sex with men']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2017,992570,0.04862079377425003

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies.

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance.

"Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection through analysis of plasma and CSF exosomes and the relationship of exosome protein cargo to inflammation and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. Systemic inflammation in HIV infection and other conditions is associated with increased risk of depression through mechanisms involving altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and other unknown mechanisms. Exosomes mediate cell-cell communication during inflammation and other conditions, but their role in neuroimmune interactions involved in depression have not been defined. Preliminary studies showed increased levels of circulating exosomes in HIV patients on ART compared to controls. Moreover, we identified heat shock proteins, Wnt proteins, and other protein cargo in these exosomes that correlate with HIV status, altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, and depressive symptoms. Given that dysregulated Wnt/GSK3-β signaling and inflammatory responses have been linked to depression and other mood disorders, these findings suggest that circulating exosomes may play a role in neuroimmune interactions that impact depression through effects on Wnt/GSK3-β and/or TLR-mediated signaling. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well characterized HIV+ cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize plasma and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depression, inflammation markers, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolites. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models that predict depression status and relevant pathways. This approach may define novel relationships between circulating exosome cargo and neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in HIV infection, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets based on the biology of exosomes.

The studies may define novel relationships between exosome cargo and neuroimmune mechanisms of depression, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets based on the biology of exosomes.        ",Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection,9136462,R01MH110259,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Catabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HMGB1 gene', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Interferons', 'Kynurenine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Neuroimmunomodulation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'S100A8 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan 2,3 Dioxygenase', 'Tryptophan Metabolism Pathway', 'Tryptophanase', 'Viremia', 'Western Blotting', 'Wnt proteins', 'acylcarnitine', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'beta catenin', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'exosome', 'glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'interest', 'monoamine', 'neuroAIDS', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIMH,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2016,350000,0.04516745688877269
"She's PrEPared: The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Engagement in the PrEP Care Continuum Project Summary/Abstract A significant relationship exists between intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV. IPV-exposed women are almost 10 times more likely to report an HIV infection. Extant research indicates multiple direct (e.g., forced sex with risky partner) and indirect (e.g., poor mental health) pathways linking IPV experiences to HIV risk. Developing ways to prevent HIV among IPV-exposed women that is not partner-dependent is needed. Pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is a daily oral medication and may be the most viable and novel HIV prevention option for IPV-exposed women. However, engaging in PrEP care can be hard including multiple steps (e.g., daily adherence, quarterly medical visits). Women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum may be disrupted by four HIV-related risk factors (economic instability, sexual autonomy, substance abuse, depressive symptoms). First, economic instability can make women dependent on their abusive partner for money and insurance, which may hinder PrEP uptake and adherence. Second, women with low sexual autonomy (e.g., freedom to express one's sexual self) may feel unable or uncomfortable using PrEP if her partner disagree with her wish to use PrEP, which can prevent PrEP uptake. Lastly, substance abuse and feelings of depression can disrupt cognition, making it difficult to engage in daily functions, which may prevent PrEP adherence. To date, there is a dearth of studies examining the implications of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum, despite the potential barriers associated with IPV. This is concerning since the Trans-NIH HIV- Related Research Priorities called for research addressing how violence influences experiences along the HIV prevention continuum. This F31 aims to improve the sexual health of women across these research aims: (1a) Examine the effects of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum (i.e., interest, uptake, adherence, follow-up visits), and HIV-related risk factors using data from a cohort study of women (n=250); (1b) Explore four HIV-related risk factors as mediators linking IPV and the PrEP care continuum; and (2) Describe women's experiences and processes along the PrEP care continuum (n=32). The proposed research addresses a critical need to understand the relationship between IPV and women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum in order to implement PrEP care in a safe and effective way. This research will devise PrEP engagement strategies, inform intervention development, and help the fight against HIV/AIDS for women.

"Mining Social Media Messages for HIV Testing and Prevention Communication PROJECT SUMMARY With the advent of Big Data methods, social media is the proverbial low-hanging fruit to disseminate HIV prevention and testing messages on a large scale 1,2. These media already transmit messages on condom use, HIV testing, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), from government institutions, NGOs, private citizens, and community groups, but it does so in an informal way. This real-time repository of real-world health messages, along with our ability to mine and pinpoint counties that need to engage in a conversation about HIV prevention and testing, offers a unique opportunity to develop Big Data methods for geographically targeted message dissemination. Despite some interventions designed for online delivery 3–19, the overall potential of social media and their most promising contents (e.g., actionable messages with behavioral instructions) have surprisingly not been established to date. Our project will focus on the disease-burdened population of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM), and will develop a highly significant computing infrastructure (Aim 1) to automatically and continuously input social media postings from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, behavioral data from the American Men Internet Survey (AMIS), and HIV prevalence data from AIDSVu.org, and using that triangulation, to target counties that need social media messages about condom use, HIV testing, and/or PrEP for MSM. Using machine learning methods, the same platform will then select actionable and acceptable messages to fill county gaps. Once the platform has been refined with input from research participants who are employees of health departments, it will be used to send experimental messages (Aim 2), selected to match county needs, and to be actionable and acceptable to a group of health departments randomized to the experimental condition. The success of the experimental messages will be gauged by the hallmarks of social media, repostings, Likes, Dislike, and comment favorability, compared with the success of a random selection of HIV-relevant messages sent to a different group of health departments randomized to the control condition. The project is innovative in several ways. First, the social media messages will involve diverse inputs (text, images, videos) never before brought together in this area. Second, we are not aware of the prior use of the proposed triangulation involving epidemiological, behavioral, and social media data. Third, a method of mining naturally accruing messages will be new and transformative, allowing for the generation of “live” campaigns with messages selected that remain current, sustainable, and community-based by design. Further, the use of an implementation-science experiment at a large, geographically distributed, scale is highly novel. These research aims are facilitated by unique team expertise about communication and persuasion, Big Data methods, public health, and Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling, and leading institutions in the areas of psychology, public health, and computer science.

"CNS Viral Escape in HIV-infected Adults Project Summary The goal of this project is to understand mechanisms leading to CNS viral escape in HIV-infected adults on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, particularly the role of drug resistance. Despite current antiretroviral therapies (ART), viral escape in CSF is estimated to occur in 4-20% of patients with plasma suppression, representing a barrier to HIV cure. Factors associated with CSF escape include low-level viremia, prior virologic failure, low CD4 nadir, and long duration of HIV infection, but underlying mechanisms and influence of ART drug CNS penetration, drug resistance mutations (DRMs), size of the brain reservoir, and neuroinflammation on CSF escape remain unclear. M184V/I, which confers resistance to FTC/3TC, is the most common nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) DRM detected in blood. Preliminary studies showed M184V/I was frequently detected in patients with CSF escape despite plasma suppression, often detected together with thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs) in CSF. Moreover, we demonstrated a significant association between protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART regimens and CSF escape in patients with plasma suppression. Given low CNS penetration of PIs, patients with plasma M184V/I, particularly those on PI-based ART including tenofovir, have increased risk of CSF escape as a consequence of inadequate CNS penetration of ART regimens when M184V/I is present, leading to incomplete suppression of myeloid cell reservoirs in brain while selecting for TAMs and other DRMs in the CNS. To investigate these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well-characterized cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize viral reservoirs in plasma, CSF, and brain for evidence of ongoing viral replication, profile DRMs in the RT, PR, and IN genes, and evaluate neuroinflammatory and blood-brain barrier biomarkers in patients with CSF escape. These studies will provide important insights into causes of CNS viral escape that are relevant for optimizing clinical management and overcoming obstacles to HIV cure. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to understand mechanisms leading to viral escape in the CNS in HIV-infected adults with plasma suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly the role of drug resistance.

"Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in Children and Adolescents with HIV in Zambia Project Summary/Abstract:  This proposal represents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of longitudinal cognitive outcomes among children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s prior research and experience, and will introduce the candidate to new skills that will be shared by the mentorship team led by Dr. Gretchen Birbeck, an expert in neuroepidemiology and clinical trials in resource-limited settings. The proposed training and mentored research will enable the candidate to transition to an independent research career focused on neurologic complications of HIV.  Cognitive impairment is common in children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in low-resource settings, affecting up to 50% of perinatally-infected children in Sub-Saharan Africa. In children with HIV receiving Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), opportunistic infections and severe HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy have become less common, but more subtle forms of cognitive impairment have increased in prevalence. The foundation for this proposal is based on research conducted by the candidate as part of the HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Zambia (HANDZ) study, in which 208 children and adolescents with HIV and 208 HIV-exposed uninfected controls were recruited, and clinical risk factors and biomarkers for cognitive impairment were evaluated. In the HANDZ study, we found that serum markers produced by activated platelets and pro- inflammatory monocytes associated with depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, suggesting that platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) may be key drivers in HIV-associated cognitive impairment. In the proposed project, the population recruited as part of HANDZ will be followed longitudinally for a total of five years, and an additional HIV-unexposed uninfected control group will be recruited.  The aims of this proposal include 1) To evaluate whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes predict depression and cognitive outcomes in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia 2) To assess whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes are associated with cerebrovascular disease in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV and 3) To develop a comprehensive predictive model of cognitive change in children with HIV incorporating clinical characteristics, plasma biomarkers, and imaging biomarkers. The short- term goal of this application is to 1) Train the applicant through mentored research 2) Identify a subpopulation of children and adolescents with HIV at high risk of cognitive decline and 3) From clinical profiles, plasma biomarkers and imaging characteristics, identify factors associated with the greatest effect on cognitive outcomes that can be targeted in future intervention studies. The long-term impact will include setting the stage for clinical trials of interventions to prevent or treat HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in children and adolescents. Project Narrative As a consequence of the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy, HIV in children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa is evolving from a universally fatal illness into a chronic condition, often complicated by comorbidities including depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. However, there are few longitudinal studies assessing these comorbidities in children and adolescents in low-resource settings. This prospective study of Zambian children and adolescents will identify risk factors and biomarkers for HIV- associated comorbidities that will set the stage for future clinical trials.",Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in Children and Adolescents with HIV in Zambia,10010185,K23NS117310,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Encephalopathies', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Encephalopathy', 'HIV-associated cognitive impairment', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Outcome', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Serum Markers', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Zambia', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'immune activation', 'improved', 'insight', 'monocyte', 'nanoformulation', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'subclinical depression', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K23,2020,193519,0.02655986395685573
"Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychiatric disorders and substance misuse are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and have negative effects on HIV control. These conditions impose substantial emotional and physical burdens, impede the achievement of virologic suppression, and are associated with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. While it is common for PWH to have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, relatively little is known about the ways in which combinations of psychiatric symptoms and substance misuse behaviors confer elevated risk for poor HIV control, or how to personalize the management of these commonly co-occurring disorders. Furthermore, estimates of the potential public-health impact of mental health service innovations on the HIV epidemic are generally lacking. Recent innovations in statistics and machine learning make it possible to harness complex data to identify patterns of psychiatric disease in PWH and tailor psychiatric therapy to optimize HIV control in ways that classical statistical approaches cannot.  The candidate is a translational and computational investigator and general internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University with a background in computer science and biostatistics. During this award period, he will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans HIV care, psychiatric epidemiology, machine learning, population-level HIV modeling, and personalized medicine. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent, translational researcher who applies innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the health of individuals and populations at the intersection of HIV and mental health.  The overarching objective for this project is to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing models that leverage complex data to inform patient care and public policy. Three aims will be undertaken: (1) to identify how combinations of symptoms of depression and anxiety and misuse of alcohol, cocaine, opioids, marijuana, and amphetamines impact individual-level HIV control; (2) to use repeated patient-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and substance misuse to predict future mental health and HIV control under a potential pharmacotherapies; and (3) to develop population models that project the impact of mental health service interventions on HIV incidence and mortality. The models will leverage data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a racially diverse, multi-site cohort of over 31,000 PWH.  This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in mental health epidemiology, the care of PWH, and advanced Bayesian and machine-learning methods. Collectively, this research and career development training will provide a clear pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing the management of psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in PWH at both the individual and population level. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric comorbidities and substance misuse present major obstacles for many persons with HIV in achieving virologic suppression, with negative consequences for both individual and population health. I propose to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing innovative models that leverage complex patient data (1) to guide the care of individual persons with HIV and mental illness and (2) to inform policy decisions about systems-level interventions in mental health. As part of a mentored research training program, this award will allow me to become a leading independent researcher with the expertise to leverage complex individual- and population-level data to optimize the health of individuals and populations with HIV who suffer from mental illness.","Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health",9995041,K08MH118094,"['Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Amphetamines', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'dual diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'mental health epidemiology', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'personalized management', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'psychiatric symptom', 'racial diversity', 'research and development', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'transmission process', 'virology']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,198210,0.11504575536306172

"High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA ""Innovative assays to quantify the latent HIV reservoir"" that can ""facilitate proof-of-concept studies for curing HIV infection."" To meet this challenge we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure replication-competent provirus (i.e. Proviral Phenotypic Predictor; P3). An over-arching objective would be for the assay to have a ""higher throughput, faster turnaround, lower cost, and greater reproducibility"" than the current standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). We will develop and validate the proposed P3 platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using latently infected cells from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years. These participants will be well-characterize to estimated duration of infection at the start of their therapy, and will represent high, medium and low levels of HIV DNA levels. Such characterizations will be necessary to adequately address the dynamic range of the proposed P3 platform. Once P3 methods have been optimized, we will rigorously compare P3 and QVOA methods in their ability to characterize the replication competent proviral reservoir and by costs and turnaround time for results.

These participants will be well-characterize to estimated duration of infection at the start of their therapy, and will represent high, medium and low levels of HIV DNA levels. Such characterizations will be necessary to adequately address the dynamic range of the proposed P3 platform. Once P3 methods have been optimized, we will rigorously compare P3 and QVOA methods in their ability to characterize the replication competent proviral reservoir and by costs and turnaround time for results.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is specifically designed to develop and validate a high-throughput next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform (P3=""Proviral Phenotypic Predictor"") to fully characterize the latent HIV reservoir through quantification and sequencing of Full-length HIV provirus. We will determine the accuracy and exact error rate for our proposed platform, and we will compare this new assay to the standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) to delineate what amount of intact and replication competent HIV genomes is not inducible (and therefore not recognized) by QVOA. Being able to characterize each part of the HIV DNA population, and especially determine what proportion of intact and replication competent HIV DNA is not inducible by standard QVOA, will allow us to better evaluate the impact of any intervention aimed at reducing the HIV latent reservoir. 1            ",High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy,8965553,R01AI120009,"['Address', 'Allogenic', 'Appearance', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Competence', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'HIV Genome', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Impact evaluation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Nonsense Codon', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Proviruses', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cost', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'next generation sequencing', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,390155,0.14079578354990527
"The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa PROJECT SUMMARY Specific Aims: Developing effective interventions to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes among populations disproportionately affected by HIV is a priority for NIH-funded HIV research in 2019. This study will explore the effects and uptake of an artificially intelligent, socially supportive chatbot – a computer that texts with users via mobile phone – among young women and men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV in South Africa. Specifically, the study will (1) develop an online scale to measure social support from a chatbot among young adults; (2) evaluate associations of social support from a chatbot with changes in depressive symptoms and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among young women and YMSM in South Africa; and (3) describe barriers and facilitators to uptake of a chatbot among young women and YMSM in South Africa. Significance: Young South Africans between the ages of 15 to 24 are at high risk of contracting and dying from HIV. Though ART extends life and prevents transmission, many young adults have poor adherence. Research in high-income countries suggest that automated two-way messaging with chatbots improves adherence to health behaviors. Chatbots may also address depressive symptoms and lack of social support, which are consistently identified barriers to adherence. Chatbots are rarely used to improve HIV care in low- and middle-income countries. If this study’s aims are achieved, then (1) future researchers will be able to more accurately measure social support from chatbots; (2) chatbots could potentially be used to promote adherence to medications and increase access to mental health support; and (3) future design and implementation of chatbots to improve HIV care will be optimized. This study’s long-term objective is to generate evidence for an effective, scalable intervention that engages hard-to-reach populations living with HIV. Approach: Aim 1 will develop a scale to measure social support from a chatbot using principal components and exploratory factor analyses applied to data gathered from 1,200 young adults worldwide who use Replika, a freely available mobile application (app). Aims 2 and 3 will invite 160 young women and YMSM living with HIV in Cape Town, South Africa to use the Replika app for four weeks in a pre-post study design. Aim 2 will employ an analysis of covariance using generalized multivariable linear regression models to assess the relationship between feelings of social support from the Replika app and changes in depressive symptoms and ART adherence. Aim 3 will leverage surveys (quantitative) and interviews (qualitative) in a mixed methods study to characterize differences between users with high- and low-frequency engagement with the app. Fellowship Information: This study is the dissertation for Ms. Brooke Jarrett, a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. Her training will consist of research methods and science communication toward her career goal of becoming a researcher of state-of-the-art mobile technologies to improve the physical and mental health of young people affected by health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Though medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can greatly increase life expectancy and prevent new HIV infections, many young adults living with HIV do not adhere to their prescribed daily regimen of medications. Artificially intelligent chatbots – or a computer that texts back-and-forth with users – may be able to promote adherence to health behaviors. This study will explore whether and how chatbots can provide social support, alleviate depressive symptoms, and improve medication adherence among young women and men who have sex with men living with HIV in South Africa.","The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa",9925884,F31MH121128,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Analysis of Covariance', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Epidemiology', 'Factor Analysis', 'Feeling', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Habits', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Service delivery model', 'Social Environment', 'Social support', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Southern Africa', 'Stigmatization', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'aged', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'chatbot', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'effective intervention', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'physical conditioning', 'posters', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'social norm', 'social stigma', 'therapy adherence', 'transmission process', 'treatment disparity', 'uptake', 'young adult', 'young men who have sex with men', 'young woman']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.12666703190762105
"Predictive Analytics for Retention in HIV Care Retention in care is essential to HIV treatment and prevention, yet less than half of people living with HIV in the U.S. are retained in medical care. Effective retention interventions, such as intensive case management and patient navigation, are highly resource intensive. With diminishing resources for HIV care, better approaches are needed to identify patients at highest risk for retention failure who would most benefit from retention resources. A predictive model may quantify a specific patient's risk of future retention-in-care failure based on his/her unique characteristics. Such a predictive model based on electronic health data and supplemental social factor informed data could be automated to generate risk prediction in real time. Instead of attempting to locate and re-engage patients who are “lost to follow-up” as is the current practice, a predictive model would allow case managers to identify at risk clients and intervene to prevent retention failure before it occurs. I have a strong background in clinical informatics, biostatistics, and epidemiology. Through this K23, I will further develop my skills in longitudinal data analysis and advanced data analytics and create a predictive model of retention in care. In Aim 1, I will create a predictive model of retention in care using EHR data from a large clinical data research network spanning 11 healthcare systems in Chicago, utilizing mixed effects logistic regression and random forest. Through Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the addition of supplemental social factor informed electronic data sources into the predictive model enhances its performance (e.g., unstructured text of EHR notes, geospatial data, social media data). Finally, in Aim 3, I will explore the feasibility of using the model in real time to increase retention efforts for at-risk patients. I will complete this project under the supervision of my mentor (Dr. John Schneider), co-mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), and my advisory team (Dr. Robert Gibbons, Rayid Ghani, and Dr. C.

In addition, they serve as Directors of the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination (Schneider), Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Meltzer), Center for Data Science and Public Policy (Ghani), Center for Health Statistics (Gibbons), and Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Brown). An integrated program of coursework, seminars, structured mentorship, research activities, and conferences will provide me with the skills necessary to complete the proposed research and transition to independence. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator utilizing HIV informatics to develop prediction models and tools to inform HIV prevention and treatment across the HIV care continuum.

"An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care II (ADAPT-R II) Abstract This R34 application is best understood in the context of both a NIH-funded sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) “Adaptive Strategies to Prevent and Treat Lapses of Retention (ADAPT-1)” nearing completion and a future trial (ADAPT-3) motivated by observations from the ADAPT-1. Retention in HIV treatment over long periods of time represents an archetypal complex public health problem and requires innovative solutions. The diversity of intensities and types of barriers to engagement mean that no single intervention is needed by all nor will work for all in need. For example, counseling could help a patient experiencing stigma, but will not help an individual who wants to come but cannot afford transportation. To respond to this conundrum, we carried out a SMART (ADAPT-1) to test a family of adaptive retention strategies. By maintaining lower intensity interventions in those doing well, adaptive strategies optimize efficiency, while escalating in those not doing well enhances effectiveness. In ADAPT-1, we initially randomized patients to one of three lower intensity interventions (standard of care (SOC), SMS messages and a conditional cash transfer). Only those who fail to be consistently retained are re-randomized to one of three more intensive interventions (SOC outreach, SMS message with a conditional cash transfer, or a navigator). Emerging ADAPT-1 results (in forthcoming publications) confirm our original hypothesis that pegging the retention intervention to patient behavior improves outcomes, the study also revealed additional opportunities to extend a “precision public health” paradigm. Specifically, we observed that different patients (based on sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics) respond differentially to different adaptive retention strategies. This observation begs a further hypothesis: use of predictive analytics (optimized with cutting-edge machine learning techniques) to distribute each intervention (e.g., SOC, cash transfer, SMS) to those patients most likely to respond to that intervention can achieve further gains in effectiveness and efficiency over any single sequenced retention strategy, even if strategy is itself already adaptive. We plan a future R01 application to test a machine learning based distribution of retention interventions as compared to best single sequential adaptive interventions (from ADAPT-1). To prepare for the novel trial, we propose this R34, to (1) develop and test the information technology basis for delivering on-demand predictions to health care workers in the field, (2) refine the statistical foundations of machine learning ability to predict through simulations and (3) assess the fit of machine learning based recommendations in the organizational, policy and ethical context of health systems in Kenya. Project Narrative Engagement in HIV treatment, both retention and adherence, represents a persistent, complex health behavior problem in Africa where public health success over the long run demands innovative approaches to retain and virally suppress patients.

"Statin Use and Efficacy Among HIV-Infected Patients by Cholesterol Risk Category DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected patients are thought to be an at-risk group for elevated rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet it is not known whether traditional cardiovascular preventative guidelines are applicable to this group. Specifically, it has not been determined whether treatment with statins reduces risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for HIV-infected patients and whether criteria for statin use should be determined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia, which were developed for use in general populations. Data indicate that the mechanism of CVD in HIV populations may differ from the general population and may be driven in large part by HIV-associated inflammatory and immunologic changes, suggesting that strategies for cardiovascular prevention may differ as well. In the proposed study, we will assess the applicability of the NCEP ATPIII guidelines to HIV populations. Aim 1 will involve ascertaining whether statins are prescribed according to criteria for use, determining rates of statin use in HIV and matched control patients according to whether patients had attained their LDL goal prior to statin initiation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association o statin therapy with incident AMI among HIV-infected patients, answering the question of whether AMI risk reduction with statins differs based on whether patients had met criteria for statin use prior to drug initiation. The finding we anticipate - that statins reduce cardiovascular risk even n HIV-infected patients who do not meet conventional criteria for use - would indicate that HIV-infected patients merit different and tailored criteria for statin use. The research design will harness the power of a large health care system-based data registry with infrastructure already tailored to assess specific CVD-related and HIV-related variables in HIV and matched control patients, thereby offering an innovative and efficient approach to answer the research questions. Advanced analytic techniques, including natural language processing tools and propensity score analysis, will be employed to enable the most rigorous observational data study. Moreover, the anticipated update of the NCEP guidelines provides a potential opportunity to assess our study hypotheses using the most up-to date recommendations for the general population. The proposed study will leverage existing data to advance the field of cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention in an at-risk subgroup, answering the following key and previously unanswered question: Should HIV providers prescribe statins to patients using the same criteria as for the general population? As the first study assessing cardiovascular risk reduction with statins among HIV-infected patients, the data will fill a critical knowledge gap, providing knowledge on the applicability of standard cardiovascular preventative guidelines for HIV populations and impacting the development of HIV-specific criteria for statin use through clinical trials. The findings will have broad relevance to both HIV clinical care paradigms and to cardiovascular risk reduction for at-risk populations with novel risk factors for CVD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but optimal preventative strategies are unknown.

"Statin Use and Efficacy Among HIV-Infected Patients by Cholesterol Risk Category     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected patients are thought to be an at-risk group for elevated rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet it is not known whether traditional cardiovascular preventative guidelines are applicable to this group. Specifically, it has not been determined whether treatment with statins reduces risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for HIV-infected patients and whether criteria for statin use should be determined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia, which were developed for use in general populations. Data indicate that the mechanism of CVD in HIV populations may differ from the general population and may be driven in large part by HIV-associated inflammatory and immunologic changes, suggesting that strategies for cardiovascular prevention may differ as well. In the proposed study, we will assess the applicability of the NCEP ATPIII guidelines to HIV populations. Aim 1 will involve ascertaining whether statins are prescribed according to criteria for use, determining rates of statin use in HIV and matched control patients according to whether patients had attained their LDL goal prior to statin initiation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association o statin therapy with incident AMI among HIV-infected patients, answering the question of whether AMI risk reduction with statins differs based on whether patients had met criteria for statin use prior to drug initiation. The finding we anticipate - that statins reduce cardiovascular risk even n HIV-infected patients who do not meet conventional criteria for use - would indicate that HIV-infected patients merit different and tailored criteria for statin use. The research design will harness the power of a large health care system-based data registry with infrastructure already tailored to assess specific CVD-related and HIV-related variables in HIV and matched control patients, thereby offering an innovative and efficient approach to answer the research questions. Advanced analytic techniques, including natural language processing tools and propensity score analysis, will be employed to enable the most rigorous observational data study. Moreover, the anticipated update of the NCEP guidelines provides a potential opportunity to assess our study hypotheses using the most up-to date recommendations for the general population. The proposed study will leverage existing data to advance the field of cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention in an at-risk subgroup, answering the following key and previously unanswered question: Should HIV providers prescribe statins to patients using the same criteria as for the general population? As the first study assessing cardiovascular risk reduction with statins among HIV-infected patients, the data will fill a critical knowledge gap, providing knowledge on the applicability of standard cardiovascular preventative guidelines for HIV populations and impacting the development of HIV-specific criteria for statin use through clinical trials. The findings will have broad relevance to both HIV clinical care paradigms and to cardiovascular risk reduction for at-risk populations with novel risk factors for CVD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but optimal preventative strategies are unknown. Specifically, it is not known whether current guidelines used to the general population are applicable to HIV-infected patients with respect to criteria to use statins, widely used lipid-lowering medications which have been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease in the general population. The current study will determine rates of statin use and whether statin use is associated with a decreased risk of heart attack in an HIV patient group, according to whether patient met criteria for statin use.

"EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high, and uptake of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) low, in Black, Latino, and underinsured individuals in the U.S. Healthcare providers at safety net community health centers (CHCs) provide care to racially diverse populations with high rates of underinsurance. However, providers cite barriers to PrEP prescribing, including lack of tools to identify candidates for PrEP. Without practical tools to help providers identify patients at risk for HIV infection and prescribe PrEP when appropriate, the population-level benefits of PrEP are unlikely to be realized. Electronic clinical decision support using data embedded in patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to fulfill this need. EHRs contain rich data that can help identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition, including demographics, diagnoses, testing patterns, prescriptions, and social determinants of health. In our prior work, we developed and validated prediction models using EHR data from two large healthcare systems in Massachusetts and California, with patient populations of 1.1 and 4.3 million, to identify patients at high risk for incident HIV. These machine learning models had strong predictive performance, with C-statistics up to 0.91. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a clinical decision support tool that incorporates an HIV risk prediction model can help providers identify patients at high risk for HIV infection and improve PrEP prescribing. Our study setting is a national network of CHCs with 2.8 million patients (OCHIN). We will first tailor our HIV prediction models to this clinic network, and then conduct formative work with providers to inform our development of alerts and additional PrEP decision support tools that will be effective and welcomed. The study team includes experts in HIV, PrEP implementation, predictive analytics, and healthcare delivery in CHCs. Our specific aims are to 1) optimize prediction models that use EHR data to identify potential PrEP candidates in racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient populations; 2) explore providers’ perspectives on barriers to PrEP prescribing, and their preferences for PrEP decision support, to inform development of an EHR-based decision support tool for CHCs; and 3) conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an EHR-based clinical decision support intervention on PrEP-related care in CHCs. We will assess impact on metrics across the PrEP care continuum, including prescriptions, persistence, clinical monitoring, and tests and diagnoses of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This proposal is innovative in its use of predictive analytics and clinical decision support to optimize PrEP. The project is significant because our intervention will be scalable across CHCs nationally and to other healthcare systems with EHRs, and because it addresses the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic by scaling up PrEP in high- incidence settings. The expected outcome is the foundation for a cluster randomized trial to test whether EHR- based decision support for PrEP can prevent new HIV infections in a national network of CHCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scale-up of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy of the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic. However, healthcare providers lack tools to identify patients who are at increased risk for HIV infection and thus potential candidates for PrEP. This research will lay essential groundwork for a full-scale study to test whether integrating automated tools into electronic health records to help providers identify potential candidates for PrEP can improve PrEP prescribing and prevent new HIV infections in community health centers.",EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers,9926611,R34MH122291,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Community Health Networks', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Priorities', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Underinsured', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'anal pap smear', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'demographics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'safety net', 'scale up', 'side effect', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIMH,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R34,2020,280307,0.0971537811932099
"Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have modified Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection from a nearly universal fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition, yet associated symptoms like cognitive impairments (CI) persist at a higher rate than in comparable uninfected control populations. These impairments are heterogeneous in terms of presentation (e.g. cognitive domains) and trajectory. Given that domain-specific impairments are likely due to different pathological changes, studies that investigate CI based on a global metric of impairment are likely to miss this. The application of advanced analysis methods, including machine learning to interrogate complex diseases and biological processes, is beginning to transform our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to complex diseases, including CI in the setting of HIV infection. In order to identify and characterize factors that contribute to nonlinear patterns of cognitive change, we propose to capitalize on over 20 years of data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). MACS is one of the largest and longest running studies of men infected with HIV, that includes a substudy with biannual neurocognitive testing that began in 1988. A complete battery of longitudinal neurocognitive testing data is available to us through this cohort, as well as concurrent datasets that include demographic, clinical, psychiatric, lifestyle and biochemical data. The data set consists of over 3500 subjects with over 500,000 data points. In Aim 1, we propose to use data-driven methods (k-means clustering for joint longitudinal trajectories and dynamic time warping) to identify groups of individuals with distinct domain-specific patterns of cognitive change. In Aim 2, we will use the vast amount of data collected on these subjects to identify subtype-specific variables that contribute or predict group membership. By using advanced machine learning methods that are unconstrained by preset statistical or biological assumptions, we are uniquely positioned to identify factors that contribute to longitudinal patterns of change in specific cognitive functions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive changes in HIV can be indicative of varying neuropathological mechanisms of impairment. This project aims to shed light on those mechanisms by analyzing pre-existing data from the MACS cohort to identify groups of HIV infected men with similar cognitive trajectories and then mining the available data to identify risk factors and contributing variables to those trajectories. By using advanced machine-learning methods to analyze non-linear patterns we will provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of domain-specific cognitive declines and may create an iterative framework for precision-based medicine approaches to treat cognitive impairment.",Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals,10013477,R03MH123290,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Effect', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motor', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data reduction', 'executive function', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'precision medicine', 'secondary analysis']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,81875,0.08087709718029815
"Immune protection against HIV by induction of CD4+CTLs. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although CD8+ T cells are important in clearing viral infections, many subjects with CD8+ T cell immunodeficiencies have relatively mild disease. CD4+ cytolytic T cells have long been ignored and mistakenly viewed to be senescent cells. Recent studies in mice and humans have re- awakened interest in these cells and they are now recognized to have a distinct molecular developmental program and to be of relevance from a disease standpoint. Some data suggests that they cells may be potent at controlling HIV. Our goal in this application is understand the molecular basis for CD4+CTL induction especially in the context of HIV infection and its control. The long-term strategy is to rationally adjuvant HIV immunization soon after disease acquisition in order to effectively generate HIV-specific CD4+ CTLs that have the potential to clear the virus and/or prevent disease progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A previously poorly understood type of T cell may be an important contributor to protection against HIV.

"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to develop software to allow researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses. It also will provide data on the ethical issues associated with the increasing number of these “social data mining” approaches.

"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care.

Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program.

"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve.

"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings.

"The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic HIV is associated with increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Despite use of antiretroviral therapy, rates of even rare vascular complications such as pulmonary hypertension occur upwards of 25 times that in HIV- individuals. The cause for such a high rate of vascular complications in HIV is unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) is a critically important signaling molecule that is produced by the vascular endothelium and acts as a vasodilator and regulator of cardiovascular health. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. The enterosalivary NO pathway is an important component of nitric oxide generation as nitrate is converted to nitrite by a series of bacterial enzymes in the mouth, which is then swallowed and either directly converted to NO or absorbed into the bloodstream where it exerts systemic NO-like effects. The enterosalivary NO pathway depends on viable populations of oral bacteria and helps regulate blood pressure and mitigate vascular injury. However, little is known about the specific bacterial populations involved or the contribution to systemic NO availability and vascular injury and disease. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIV+ individuals have a different profile of oral commensal bacteria (oral microbiome) than HIV- individuals that involves key nitrate reduction pathways. This study proposes the novel hypothesis that the accelerated cardio- and pulmonary vascular disease seen in HIV is due in part to changes in the oral microbiome that favor a disruption of the enterosalivary NO pathway, reduced NO availability, and chronic vascular injury. To test this hypothesis, the oral microbiome of an established cohort of 315 HIV+ and HIV- participants will be characterized using culture-independent sequencing techniques in banked oral wash samples. Expression of specific bacterial nitrate-reducing enzymes will be measured, and results correlated with available serological markers of vascular damage, echocardiographic testing, and radiographic measures of vascular injury. Results will directly inform future clinical enrollment of a prospective trial examining real-time nitrate metabolism, systemic NO distribution, and associated physiological effects. These investigations will offer the first stepsin understanding a novel pathway of HIV-associated vascular disease and inform development of targeted therapies. Additionally, this NRSA award will provide the candidate, a pulmonary medicine fellow, the opportunity for further training in pulmonary vascular medicine and for developing skills in HIV/AIDS and microbiome research. The candidate will acquire extensive training in basic and advanced laboratory techniques, biostatistics, and clinical study design through labwork, conferences, and a master's degree in clinical/translational research. The resources and experience of mentors Dr. Morris, an expert in HIV-related lung disease and the microbiome, and Dr. Gladwin, an expert in NO and pulmonary vascular disease, combined with the expansive array of resources available at the University of Pittsburgh, will support the candidate's successful development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular diseases remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals in the current era of effective antiretroviral therapy. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. Normal populations of bacteria that live in the mouth are key in maintaining adequate levels of nitric oxide and thus important in vascular function, but these key bacteria may be altered in those with HIV and contribute to excess pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular risk.

"The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic HIV is associated with increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Despite use of antiretroviral therapy, rates of even rare vascular complications such as pulmonary hypertension occur upwards of 25 times that in HIV- individuals. The cause for such a high rate of vascular complications in HIV is unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) is a critically important signaling molecule that is produced by the vascular endothelium and acts as a vasodilator and regulator of cardiovascular health. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. The enterosalivary NO pathway is an important component of nitric oxide generation as nitrate is converted to nitrite by a series of bacterial enzymes in the mouth, which is then swallowed and either directly converted to NO or absorbed into the bloodstream where it exerts systemic NO-like effects. The enterosalivary NO pathway depends on viable populations of oral bacteria and helps regulate blood pressure and mitigate vascular injury. However, little is known about the specific bacterial populations involved or the contribution to systemic NO availability and vascular injury and disease. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIV+ individuals have a different profile of oral commensal bacteria (oral microbiome) than HIV- individuals that involves key nitrate reduction pathways. This study proposes the novel hypothesis that the accelerated cardio- and pulmonary vascular disease seen in HIV is due in part to changes in the oral microbiome that favor a disruption of the enterosalivary NO pathway, reduced NO availability, and chronic vascular injury. To test this hypothesis, the oral microbiome of an established cohort of 315 HIV+ and HIV- participants will be characterized using culture-independent sequencing techniques in banked oral wash samples. Expression of specific bacterial nitrate-reducing enzymes will be measured, and results correlated with available serological markers of vascular damage, echocardiographic testing, and radiographic measures of vascular injury. Results will directly inform future clinical enrollment of a prospective trial examining real-time nitrate metabolism, systemic NO distribution, and associated physiological effects. These investigations will offer the first stepsin understanding a novel pathway of HIV-associated vascular disease and inform development of targeted therapies. Additionally, this NRSA award will provide the candidate, a pulmonary medicine fellow, the opportunity for further training in pulmonary vascular medicine and for developing skills in HIV/AIDS and microbiome research. The candidate will acquire extensive training in basic and advanced laboratory techniques, biostatistics, and clinical study design through labwork, conferences, and a master's degree in clinical/translational research. The resources and experience of mentors Dr. Morris, an expert in HIV-related lung disease and the microbiome, and Dr. Gladwin, an expert in NO and pulmonary vascular disease, combined with the expansive array of resources available at the University of Pittsburgh, will support the candidate's successful development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular diseases remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals in the current era of effective antiretroviral therapy. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. Normal populations of bacteria that live in the mouth are key in maintaining adequate levels of nitric oxide and thus important in vascular function, but these key bacteria may be altered in those with HIV and contribute to excess pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular risk.

"Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning Project Summary Development of general and efficient methods for functionalization of alcohols is highly warranted due to the ubiquity and prominence of this functional group in natural products. Such methods would allow for late-stage diversification of complex molecules and, consequently, could have a broad impact in natural product synthesis and preparation of relevant pharmaceutical materials. However, owing to the chemical inertness of alcohols, most methods typically require installation of activating groups for functionalization, making them unattractive from an atom- and step-economical perspective. Nonetheless, many advances have been made. In particular, the Barton-McCombie reaction has become an indispensable tool for reductive functionalization of alcohols. Unfortunately, this transformation requires pre- functionalization of the alcohol substrate, employs highly toxic tin reagents, and invokes the use high reaction temperatures or harmful UV light for initiation of radical intermediates. Furthermore, the overall transformation is limited to H-atom incorporation or reductive coupling with alkenes. Lastly, only a few deoxygenation methods exist that are amenable for late-stage and site-selective deoxygenation in complex systems. Moreover, physical organic chemistry tools available to facilitate the selection of a set of conditions or parameters to afford site-selectivity are limited. In this proposal, we will develop a mild and practical photocatalytic deoxygenation of alcohols. Our strategy will focus on solving the inherent limitation of the Barton McCombie reaction by 1) avoiding the use of toxic tin reagents, 2) obviating the need for pre-functionalization of the alcohol substrate, and 3) allowing for modular coupling of formed alkyl radicals via Ni-catalysis. Specific aim 1 explores the development of a novel photoredox-catalyzed deoxygenation of alcohols. In addition, we outline a general protocol for deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols via inception of the alkyl radical intermediate, formed via β-scission, with various radical electrophiles. Moreover, we highlight an innovative method for the direct cross-coupling of alcohols via metallophotoredox catalysis in both racemic and enantioselective fashion. Specific aim 2 addresses the design strategy for implementing physical chemistry techniques such as Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space. Also, we outline applying this strategy to identify a set of optimal conditions to confer site-selective functionalization in complex polyols. Project Narrative Mild and site-controlled deoxygenation of alcohols could significantly accelerate the late-stage synthesis/diversification of important organic molecules; however, current methods often employ toxic tin reagents, harsh reaction conditions, and require prefunctionalization of the alcohols employed. The strategy proposed would allow for a mild photocatalytic deoxygenation, as well as deoxyfunctionalization, of alcohols that solves the aforementioned limitations of prior art. Moreover, the proposed strategy outlines implementation of physical organic chemistry tools Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space.",Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning,9759306,F32GM129910,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Alkenes', 'Arts', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Employment', 'Intercept', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Organic Synthesis', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phosphines', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Visible Radiation', 'alcohol involvement', 'catalyst', 'design', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'novel', 'polyol', 'predictive tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,0.11807561358477907
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research.

This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9644986,K24AI131928,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Botswana', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV prevention trial', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hypertension', 'IMPAACT', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Circumcision', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Students', 'Tenofovir', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'efavirenz', 'emtricitabine', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'perinatal HIV', 'point of care', 'population based', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'randomized trial', 'treatment program', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'virology']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2019,188858,0.2041691687058472
"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority for public health organizations. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to 1) develop software to allow (non- technical) researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses, and 2) interview participants to learn about the ethical issues that need to be addressed when building this software.

"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients. Aims 2 and 3 will implement machine learning methods within our longitudinal electronic medical record database to construct prediction models identifying HIV+ patients at greatest risk of developing HF, and to identify unique HIV-specific phenotypes of HFpEF and HFrEF. Prediction models developed in our clinical population (90% minority, 40% female) will be validated in a demographically complementary HIV+ cohort in Chicago (50% minority, 15% female) to evaluate the transportability of these models across patient populations. This award will provide ample training opportunities for the candidate to continue his progression to an independent academic research career with specialized experience at the intersection of HIV, cardiovascular disease, and medical informatics. Established institutional resources and a mentoring team with a proven record of success, as well as research conducted within a geographic area with endemic levels of HIV and heart disease, provide an ideal setting to successfully produce high quality research with major impact.

"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients.

"Evaluating predictors of HIV vaccine efficacy: Statistical methods for estimation, testing, and inference PROJECT SUMMARY We do not have a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV, a virus that causes approximately 2 million new infections each year. Current proof-of-concept studies using broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV aim to understand how prevention varies with genotypic characteristics of the virus. Since performing an exhaustive search over all genotypic characteristics results in low statistical power to detect effects after adjusting for multiple comparisons, researchers typically pre-specify a small number of features to focus on. There is growing interest in using machine learning-based methods to both corroborate prior understanding and suggest new important genotypic characteristics in predicting sensitivity of the HIV virus to bnAbs. While machine learning-based methods have the potential to yield valid predictive models, issues remain in using these methods for estimating importance. The proposed research will address three such issues: developing a model-free variable importance measure, incorporating information from complex sampling designs, and valid statistical inference both when a genotypic feature is truly important and when it is not. First, the main classical tool for evaluating the importance of characteristics is the ANOVA decomposition, which makes strong modeling assumptions. Machine learning-based methods use minimal assumptions; however, these methods do not generally admit valid statistical inference, and the importance estimates are intimately tied to the technique employed. We will employ an approach based on ideas from the theory of semiparametric estimation and inference to develop a model-free measure of variable importance with valid confidence intervals for the true importance. Second, many HIV vaccine trials incorporate a nested case-control study, where additional information is measured on a subset of the trial participants. Estimating importance only using the subset ignores information from the remaining participants, resulting in a loss of efficiency and potentially adding some bias in estimating variable importance. The proposed research will develop methods that properly account for the sampling design. Finally, to determine if a set of features can be excluded from further analyses, we need a procedure for testing if the feature set truly has no importance. Hypothesis testing using machine learning-based methods is challenging, but we will build on recent advances in semiparametric inference to develop valid procedures for hypothesis testing in the context of variable importance. By combining advances in machine learning technology with ideas from semiparametric estimation and inference, we will determine important feature sets in predicting sensitivity of the HIV virus to bnAbs. In addition to yielding a deeper understanding of HIV neutralization, this information will allow researchers to make the best possible use of data from current clinical trials. This, in turn, could lead to either a shorter time to an HIV vaccine or new bnAbs in the research pipeline that are more broadly efficacious or potent. Any of these outcomes will transform preventative care for patients at risk of HIV infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients living with HIV or AIDS usually require a combination of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and supportive care for life. Understanding how features of the HIV genotype explain the susceptibility of the HIV virus to neutralization by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV could lead to a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV infection, either by using a combination of bnAbs or by developing more potent or longer lasting bnAbs that target certain important regions of the HIV genotype.

"Personalized strategies for HIV treatment maintenance: an application of novel machine learning methods to HIV care in East Africa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Despite the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), public health efforts to treat persons living with HIV must address issues with patient retention in order to achieve lasting epidemic control. People living in African countries with high rates of HIV infection face different barriers to retention, including structural barriers (e.g. transport to clinic), psychosocial barriers (e.g., stigma), and others (e.g., long waiting times). This diversity of barriers contains a critical implication: no single behavioral intervention will help all patients remain in care. Given the absence of a “one-size-fits-all” solution to HIV treatment maintenance, Drs. Petersen and Geng (the current project's sponsors) co-lead a nearly completed NIH-funded trial (ADAPT-R; NCT02338739) that identifies adaptive strategies for patient retention. In ADAPT-R, HIV-positive patients initiating ART are randomized to a low-intensity intervention to prevent retention lapses. Patients are re-randomized to a high-intensity intervention to facilitate their return to care, only if initial retention is poor. By responding to a single aspect of individual patient behavior (days in treatment), this adaptive strategy is actually more efficient (patients succeeding avoid more costly interventions) and effective (patients not well-retained receive more intensive support) than intervention assignment strategies in traditional trials that assume “one size fits all.” Approach: The current proposal uses recent advances in statistics, machine learning, and causal inference to develop an analysis plan that not only leverages, but also innovates, the parent trial. This project proposes to use ADAPT-R data to design algorithms that assign each patient his/her personalized interventions based on patient characteristics measured at baseline (e.g., demographics, distance from clinic, stigma) and over time (e.g., lapses in care, updated clinical data measures, past interventions). By making optimal use of all patient characteristics measured in ADAPT-R (i.e., not just early lapses in care) to assign interventions, it is hypothesized that these algorithms will be most efficient and effective at retaining patients, compared to assignment methods used in ADAPT-R and “one-size- fits-all” traditional trials. Specific Aims: This F31 Diversity grant aims to: 1) design and test an algorithm that assigns each patient a personalized low-intensity intervention for remaining in HIV care; 2) design and test an algorithm that assigns each patient a personalized low- and high-intensity intervention, in sequence, for remaining in HIV care.

"Quantitative diagnosis of TB/HIV co-infection using pathogen-specific exosomes in blood ABSTRACT Patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) exhibit accelerated progression of both diseases. A missed TB diagnosis in a HIV-positive patient, and vice versa, can have severe consequences, since mortality rates are very high in HIV/TB co-infected patients. The World Health Organization thus recommends HIV testing for TB patients and TB screening for HIV-affected patients. Early diagnosis of HIV/TB co-infections and appropriately timed interventions can improve health outcomes by slowing disease progression and reducing mortality and the spread of these infections. Given this urgent need for early diagnosis of HIV and TB, we propose to develop and validate a novel assay that rapidly and directly diagnoses both HIV and TB infections, using a sensitive nanoplasmon-enhanced scattering (nPES) platform to detect pathogen-specific (Ps) exosomes (PsExo) that carry TB- and/or HIV-derived antigens in patient serum samples. Ps antigens are often difficult to detect in circulation, due to low concentrations and potential masking by non-specific protein interactions or degradative enzymes, especially early in infection when antigen concentrations are low. Body fluids are rich in exosomes, and exosomes are rich sources of multiple Ps-antigens. Exosome enrichment effectively concentrates Ps- antigens and protects them from circulating hydrolases, thereby enhancing and improving detection. While use of PsExo as biomarkers for diagnosing specific infectious diseases is new and shows great promise, significant technical challenges, including the current lack of validated PxExo markers for specific diseases and simple and rapid assays for PsExo analysis, exist. We have recently demonstrated that we can use our nPES assay platform to quantify cancer-derived exosomes and diagnose early-stage pancreatic tumors from disease controls. We will adapt this approach to detect HIV and TB PsExo in this proposal. Aim 1 will address the first issue by identifying pathogenic proteins specifically or predominantly expressed on exosomes of infected cells and evaluating PsExo candidates by quantitative proteomics analysis of infected patients from Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) sample bank. Aim 2 will establish an optimized nPES array using Aim 1 PsExo biomarkers, apply machine learning to develop an nPES array that can effectively diagnose HIV, TB and HIV/TB patients based on nPES results, and validate these findings in an independent FIND cohort. This approach does not require a separate exosome isolation step and uses only microsample serum volumes. The proposed assay will benefit co-infected patients who are unable to produce sputum, extrapulmonary TB patients who often require invasive biopsies for diagnosis, and patients with acute HIV infections who are still HIV antibody negative. Project Narrative Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of HIV-related mortality, accounting for one in three HIV deaths, while HIV infection has contributed to a significant increase in the worldwide incidence of TB. Successful development and validation of PsExo-nPES arrays described in this proposal will improve diagnosis of HIV and TB co-infections in vulnerable and diagnostically challenging populations. This earlier and more accurate HIV and TB diagnosis will permit earlier intervention to prevent disease spread and improve patient outcomes.",Quantitative diagnosis of TB/HIV co-infection using pathogen-specific exosomes in blood,9623753,R03AI140977,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Automation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Fluids', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Endosomes', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Antibodies', 'HIV Antigens', 'HIV Core Protein p24', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hydrolase', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Sputum', 'Supervision', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic assay', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'screening']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R03,2018,78208,0.11793198473391653
"Novel Statistical Methods for Cluster-Randomized HIV Prevention Trials Project Summary/Abstract HIV remains prevalent among underserved populations in the United States and large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, prompting a strong public health focus on combination HIV prevention practices and pre-exposure pro- phylaxis (PrEP). Cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) are integral to the study of these HIV prevention methods. By collectively randomizing groups of individuals to the same treatment assignment, cluster-randomized designs minimize contamination between trial arms and make feasible the study of community-level prevention efforts. Stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trials (SW-CRTs) are a recent modiﬁcation of this design involving unidi- rectional crossover from standard-of-care to intervention.

While interim monitoring methods exist for clustered data and for time-to-event data separately, no methods currently handle both clustered and interval- censored observations.

Aim 2 develops sample size and power formulae for SW-CRTs with hierarchical clustering and longitudinal follow-up.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Cluster-Randomized HIV Prevention Trials Project Summary/Abstract HIV remains prevalent among underserved populations in the United States and large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, prompting a strong public health focus on combination HIV prevention practices and pre-exposure pro- phylaxis (PrEP).

"Long Acting Film Technology for Contraception and HIV Prevention (LATCH) PROJECT ABSTRACT Several studies (ASPIRE, VOICE) have shown that adherence is paramount to the success of HIV prevention methods in women. Providing women with options through alternative drug delivery technologies can positively impact adherence. A compelling strategy includes co-delivery of an anti-HIV agent with a contraceptive agent to prevent pregnancy. This proposal plans to develop a next generation multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) film platform for once a month intravaginal administration of the 4'-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) prodrug (EFdA-P) and a progestin (levonorgestrel (LNG) or etonogestrel (ENG)) to achieve the dual goal of preventing HIV infection and pregnancy. EFdA-P showed increased bioavailability and tissue permeability compared to the parent EFdA, a highly potent exciting new antiviral drug. This versatile extended release MPT film platform is intended to provide a discrete, low cost and convenient alternative to women at high risk of HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. Recent data from our lab shows that films can deliver an anti-HIV agent in the vagina for up to 1 month even in the context of menses and sexual intercourse. Using this knowledge and our expertise in the development of intravaginal films, this proposal will develop a film platform for co-delivery of a progestin (licensed contraceptive agent) and EFdA-P at a predetermined rate for at least 1 month. MPT films containing EFdA will also be generated for comparison. The R61 phase of this milestone driven proposal will generate critical preformulation data for EFdA/EFdA-P and LNG/ENG drug combinations and optimize the MPT film formulation to achieve one- month delivery of both drugs with desired short-term stability. This phase will also establish the compatibility of film prototype with vaginal tissue and microbial flora in vitro followed by vaginal retention studies in the non- human primate (NHP) model. The R61 phase will demonstrate the ability of the MPT film prototype to attain desired release profiles of both drugs in vivo (NHP model). Using a clearly defined go / no go criteria, a lead MPT film will be transitioned to the R33 phase. The R33 phase will involve IND-enabling activities including drug- drug interaction, in vitro transporter and metabolism studies, manufacturing scale up and establishing long-term stability of the lead MPT film. It will also demonstrate the safety (rat, rabbit, and NHP) and efficacy of the lead MPT film against SHIV infection in NHP model. It will also confirm the ability of the film to function in the context of sexual activity and its ability to deliver contraceptive levels of progestin in the NHP model. The successful completion of proposed work will generate a novel extended release MPT film platform that can be applied to other drug combinations.

"Statistical Methods for Evaluating and Guiding Implementation of New HIV Prevention Strategies PROJECT SUMMARY The HIV prevention ﬁeld has advanced dramatically in recent years through the development of antiretroviral- based prevention strategies such as Treatment-as-Prevention and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Numer- ous challenges remain that impede the implementation of these interventions and HIV remains a major global health problem. We need new preventive interventions to combat the pandemic. The rapid advancements in the ﬁeld have complicated the statistical design of efﬁcacy trials of new interventions. For instance, oral PrEP is now part of the standard HIV prevention package offered to trial participants, which poses challenges in ensur- ing adequate statistical power. Currently, available statistical methods for guiding the implementation of effective interventions are inadequate. Considering this complex HIV prevention context, our goal in Aim 1 is to iden- tify suitable efﬁcacy trial designs for evaluating the next generation of HIV prevention tools. We will consider crossover designs, sequential randomization designs, active-arm only designs, and non-inferiority designs with adaptive margins; each of these approaches addresses a key limitation of the prototypical phase 2b/3 trial de- sign currently in use. Through simulation studies and application to candidate interventions, we will investigate the relative statistical performance of the designs. We will also work with leaders in the HIV prevention ﬁeld, to identify the clinical, ethical, logistical issues and other critical factors that must be considered. We will use these factors to reﬁne our design comparisons and to identify the trial design that is most appropriate for each setting. Under Aim 2, we will address speciﬁc implementation questions in HIV prevention, through the development of improved statistical analysis methods. We will develop methods for evaluating sub-population-speciﬁc HIV risk and prevention efﬁcacy, to identify strategies for implementing interventions, and for bridging HIV incidence and prevention efﬁcacy to new settings or populations. Our approach will rely on fewer assumptions than existing methods, use a framework that leverages statistical learning to extract information from multiple predictors of risk and efﬁcacy, and accommodate data from multiple sources. We will use important and relevant datasets in HIV prevention and simulation studies designed to mimic their structure and content to gauge the performance of the approaches. Our team members include lead statistical investigators in the major HIV prevention trial networks, with considerable expertise in statistical methods development and clinical trial design, and established collabo- rations with other leaders in the clinical and laboratory science of HIV prevention. Our positions and connections make us uniquely poised to translate the novel methods into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current drugs and other preventive interventions have made important contributions to the ﬁght against HIV/AIDS. However, we will need a larger tool-box of drugs, vaccines, and other interventions to end the HIV pandemic. This project will develop and assess speciﬁc research study designs to evaluate new interventions in the presence of existing interventions, as well as provide statistical analysis methods for guiding the implementation of those that prove effective.",Statistical Methods for Evaluating and Guiding Implementation of New HIV Prevention Strategies,9971891,R56AI143418,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Economic Factors', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV prevention trials network', 'HIV risk', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injectable', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health Practice', 'Randomized', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Translating', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'cost', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'fight against', 'global health', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'member', 'method development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R56,2019,815924,0.17470323353459627
"Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework SUMMARY Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy, the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention and intervention strategies designed to reduce significantly both prevalence and incidence worldwide. In order to achieve the 2020 UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal (90% of people living with HIV diagnosed, 90% of people diagnosed to be on sustained antiretroviral treatment, and 90% of people on treatment to maintain viral suppression), it is necessary to develop innovative tools that can be used for predicting the growth and trajectory of localized sub-epidemics driven by specific transmission clusters. Phylodynamic analysis has extensively been used in the HIV field to track the origin and reconstruct the virus demographic history both at local, regional and global level. However, such studies have been so far only retrospective, with little or no power to make predictions about future epidemic trends. The overarching goal of the prosed project is to develop an innovative computational framework coupling phylodynamic inference and behavioral network data with artificial intelligence algorithms capable of predicting HIV transmission clusters future trajectory, and informing on key determinants of new infections. We propose to achieve this goal by carrying out three specific aims: 1. Develop a phylodynamic-based PRIDE module to forecast HIV infection hotspots [the infected]; 2. Develop a behavioral network-based PRIDE module for risk of HIV infection [the uninfected], and 3. Carry out focus groups for deploying the new PRIDE forecasting technology into public health, and implement prevention through the peer change agent model. In particular, through a close partnership with the Florida Department of Health (FLDoH), we will analyze existing databases that the FLDoH has assembled over the past twelve years including extensive HIV molecular sequence, clinical and behavioral network data. Florida had an HIV case rate of 24.0 per 100,000 people in 2016, and it is currently the third state in the USA in terms of yearly incidence. Our partnership with the FLDoH will ensure that the results of the proposed research will be used to curtail the HIV epidemic by optimizing public health based surveillance programs, informing targeted intervention strategies, and implementing more effective prevention measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention strategies designed to reduce significantly incidence worldwide. Integrated statewide surveillance programs have been generating and linking big amasses of molecular, demographic, and clinical data. Advanced artificial intelligence algorithms coupled with molecular epidemiology tools can exploit these complex data to generate accurate predictions on epidemic spread that can be used to identify actionable sociodemographic factors guiding precision public health intervention.",Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework,9927071,R01AI145552,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation Reports', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'complex data ', 'computer framework', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'migration', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'working group']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,705136,0.14533810138980607
"The science for the last mile: Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance to accelerate HIV elimination PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cities account for a large proportion of the global population of people living with HIV. As a result, Cities have become the focus of UNAIDS's “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic through targeted scale-up of prevention and testing services. In the United States, HIV surveillance data indicates a shifting composition of the population of people newly infected with HIV, with females and minority populations accounting for disproportionate rates of infection. These emerging health disparities in HIV incidence suggest that the largely successful “Getting to Zero” public health initiatives (e.g. rapid expansion of pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], needle exchange and safe injecting sites, etc.) are not reaching the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging routinely collected surveillance data paired with primary data collection, the major goal of this research is to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection in Fast Track cities, using San Francisco as a test case. This proposal seeks to provide multidisciplinary methodological and theoretical training to investigate the scientific knowledge gap of ongoing HIV transmission in the era of “Getting to Zero.” The proposed training areas are: (1) semi-parametric statistical modeling and machine learning in order to improve the accuracy and precision of population size estimation methods; (2) molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic techniques to assess the relatedness of HIV viral sequences between individuals, inferring a shared source of infection; and (3) minority stress theory to measure the (socio-structural) characteristics of the environment and relate these structural exposures to disparities in HIV infection. Aligned with the training components, the research goals of this study are to: (a) estimate how many people are living with HIV in San Francisco and quantify the magnitude of disparities in infection rates and access to health care services; (b) identify the sociodemographic correlates of membership to a transmission cluster; and (c) identify the socio-structural facilitators of recent HIV infections, particularly among minority populations, using a case-control study design. The evidence generated from this work could have a direct impact on San Francisco's Getting to Zero campaign and inform novel intervention targets for other Fast Track cities. Additionally, the exceptional methodological and practical experience gained from this project will position the candidate for an impactful career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cities account for a large proportion of HIV prevalence and incidence, and therefore are the focus of UNAIDS' “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic. Several “Fast Track Cities”, including San Francisco, CA, have achieved significant reductions in new HIV infections, and yet despite this success racial/ethnic and gender disparities in new infections are emerging. The proposed study will use semi-parametric statistical modeling and HIV phylogenetics applied to routinely collected public health surveillance data, paired with primary data collection informed by a minority stress theoretical framework, to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection and offer novel targets for intervention to achieve zero new infections.",The science for the last mile: Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance to accelerate HIV elimination,9926504,K01AI145572,"['Accounting', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'African American', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Antibodies', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infection', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Needle Sharing', 'Needle-Exchange Programs', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sizes', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universal Coverage', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'diverse data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender disparity', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'housing instability', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevention service', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'scale up', 'semiparametric', 'sex', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social epidemiology', 'social stigma', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'surveillance data', 'testing services', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2020,135824,0.08963442762778424
"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,9903475,U01HL146201,"['Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Baltimore', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'District of Columbia', 'Echocardiography', 'Endocrine', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver diseases', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Time', 'Viral load measurement', 'Walkers', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women’s Interagency HIV Study', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'adjudication', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data management', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'men&apos', 's group', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'synergism']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,158121,0.1451622351902131

The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately.

"Using big data and deep learning on predicting HIV transmission risk in MSM population Project Summary An important global public health priority is to develop new methods for identifying populations at greatest HIV risk, understanding HIV transmission network patterns, and intervening to reduce network risk. HIV testing is important to effect positive sexual behavior changes, and is an entry point to treatment, care, and psychosocial support. At the end of 2016, an estimated 1.1 million persons aged 13 and older were living with HIV infection in the United States, including an estimated 162,500 (14%) persons whose infections had not been diagnosed. In addition, many persons with HIV are tested late in the course of infection. Late testing results in missed opportunities for prevention and treatment of HIV, and increased risk for transmission to their partners. Current status – A number of epidemiological studies have employed social network theory/concepts and applied network analytical techniques to examine the structural characteristics of HIV transmission networks through phylogenetic link (HIV-1 pol sequences) and/or sexual/social/drug-using contacts among MSM. These studies, however, usually reduce the network information to summary information, consider only a subset of network variables, and/or use one layer of multi-dimension networks determining transmission paths such as only the social, sexual, contact, and venue perspectives. Challenges: The complexity of data that is important for HIV infection risk analysis makes it challenging to conduct risk and transmission prediction. More specifically, we are facing two challenges: (1) How to develop a mechanism to faithfully and flexibly represent the multi-dimensional network data collected from different sources at different time periods; (2) Once the data has been integrated, how to fully leverage the data to develop a risk prediction algorithm that considers the multi-dimensional networks with substantially interrelated factors in a comprehensive manner. Goals - We hypothesize that deep learning-based informatics approaches can provide a novel way for HIV infection risk prediction. In close collaboration with the public health department, we will construct a comprehensive framework that combines population-based molecular, behavior, and contact/partner tracing information including venue affiliation data and individual sex and drug-using behaviors, as well as existing locally collected cohort data. Using this dynamically collected data we will then develop practical deep-learning algorithms that leverage the comprehensive framework for cluster growth and identifying newly infected population. This proposal focuses specifically on ongoing epidemic growth among populations most at risk, including young men who have sex with men (MSM), which remain highly vulnerable to HIV in the U.S. Project Narrative A global public health priority is to develop new methods of understanding HIV transmission patterns, identifying and reaching community members at high risk for HIV infection, and intervening to reduce their infection risk. In close collaboration with the health departments of Houston and Chicago, we will construct a comprehensive framework that combines population-based molecular, behavior, and contact/partner tracing information including venue affiliation data and individual sex and drug-using behaviors, as well as existing locally collected cohort data.

"Harnessing Bioinformatics for HIV Prevention: Understanding Persistence in Comprehensive HIV Prevention Services Project Summary/Abstract: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at reducing the acquisition of HIV; however, achieving the full impact of this intervention is contingent on maintaining engagement in care throughout periods of high and low risk. Currently, in the United States, only 270,000 out of 1.2 million individuals with indications for PrEP receive it. Additionally, even for those who start PrEP, adherence, and persistence in comprehensive HIV prevention care is poor, characterized by multiple discontinuations and restarts. Furthermore, HIV risk changes over time and individual-level reasons for engagement, very early disengagement (<2 visits after initiation), early disengagement (2-4 visits after initiation), and late disengagement (>4 visits after initiation) are not well described; social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) like insurance, housing status, substance use, and mental health, are increasingly recognized as key factors. As PrEP programs expand to meet the projected need, the cost of providing support services will be substantial and thus identifying patients at highest risk of loss-to-follow-up and selecting optimal services to support persistence in care and PrEP adherence is essential. Furthermore, many individuals receiving HIV prevention services are known to receive highly fragmented care typified by multiple providers and institutions, thereby creating a challenge to accurately characterize persistence in care. Guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, we propose to address this critical area of research by focusing on factors that are associated with very early, early, and late disengagement from HIV prevention care. We will identify baseline factors through a comprehensive questionnaire conducted at the time of enrollment into comprehensive HIV prevention care. We will layer onto that longitudinal factors, such as social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH), which can vary over time, to get a more comprehensive and precise picture of factors affecting persistence in prevention care. To address the issue of fragmented care and better characterize persistence in care, we will utilize information contained in a large Health Information Exchange (HIE), Healthix, to capture all health care visits in New York. We propose to use machine-learning methods to design predictive models of disengagement from HIV prevention care. This comprehensive assessment of persistence in HIV prevention care will inform the development of high quality, scalable models of HIV prevention care, making it possible to target limited resources towards individuals at the highest risk of disengagement. Project Narrative: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at reducing the acquisition of HIV; however, achieving the full impact of this intervention is contingent on keeping patients engaged in care throughout periods of high and low risk. HIV risk changes over time and a person’s reasons for engagement, disengagement, and re- engagement in care are not well understood, but likely change over time. In this project, we propose to utilize self-reported and clinical data to elucidate reasons for very early disengagement (<2 visits after initiation), early disengagement (2-4 visits after initiation), and late disengagement (>4 visits after initiation) and use machine learning methods to design predictive models for disengagement from HIV prevention care.",Harnessing Bioinformatics for HIV Prevention: Understanding Persistence in Comprehensive HIV Prevention Services,10083011,K23AI150378,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Female', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information organization', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'men who have sex with men', 'modifiable risk', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention service', 'programs', 'prospective', 'skills', 'social', 'transgender']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K23,2020,191976,0.1850351914840242
"Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Title Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Abstract (30 Lines)  HIV testing jumpstarts the HIV prevention and treatment care continuum. HIV testing levels in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in diverse settings like Malaysia are especially low. MSM increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM has soared to 21.6% in Malaysia, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that lifetime HIV testing is 70.3%, past-year testing is 40.9% and only 9.5% were tested more than once-yearly despite extraordinary levels of self-reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in these settings are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model of behavioral change is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given the many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality and providing real-time information, motivation and behavioral skills to overcome barriers. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using smartphone apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence using machine learning (AI/ML) may overcome such limitations, but have yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test to assess acceptability and feasibility of an AI/ML-Chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual (control). Findings from this exploratory pilot study will inform a future prospective Type 1 Hybrid implementation science trial. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that adapts using machine learning and artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (TestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create a mHealth intervention for MSM to promote real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. TestBot will provide culturally-tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain the intervention.",Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing,10082768,R21AI152927,"['AIDS prevention', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Community Networks', 'Computer Systems', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemic', 'Facebook', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hybrids', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysia', 'Malaysian', 'Manuals', 'Massage', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Peru', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Same-sex', 'Sauna', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Sexual Transmission', 'Social Network', 'South Africa', 'Stigmatization', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'chatbot', 'clinical care', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'criminal behavior', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'health management', 'high risk men', 'humiliation', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'next generation', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prospective', 'response', 'same sex behavior', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social stigma', 'sodomy', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,248218,0.19801933452092402
"Mapping and dissecting the role of antibodies in Mtb control While a quarter of the world carries the burden of tuberculosis, emerging data suggests that those coinfected with HIV are at an elevated risk of reactivating the disease. However, the specific immunological perturbations that lead to loss of Tb control are poorly understood. One critical risk factor associated with HIV coinfection is the depletion of CD4 T cells, which has been linked to increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) uptake into macrophages and diminished granuloma integrity. However, even with the restoration of CD4 T cells with HAART, Mtb/HIV co-infected individuals continue to exhibit a higher risk of Mtb reactivation. However, CD4+ T cell loss/perturbations may also contribute to loss of Mtb containment through indirect mechanisms such as the loss of the requisite help to B cells required for the production of highly functional antibodies. Along these lines, mounting data point to an enrichment of anti-microbial antibody responses among latently infected individuals, able to contain bacterial growth in vitro and even control bacteria in vivo when transferred to mice prior to challenge. Thus, given our emerging appreciation for a role for antibodies in Mtb-control/killing, here we propose to use a systems serology profiling approach, to begin to define the specificities and functions of antibodies that contribute to longitudinal control of Mtb in both HIV uninfected and infected populations. Moreover, linked to B cell cloning, Fc-engineering, and in vitro/in vivo models, we also seek to divorce humoral biomarkers of Mtb control from mechanistic roles of antibodies in preventing progression to TB.

"Improved analysis of experiments and observational studies in HIV ABSTRACT More robust and accurate health knowledge is a cornerstone of better health policy and action. There are tough questions in HIV that can be addressed better with new quantitative tools. Results from experimental and observational HIV studies can be made better and more policy-relevant through development and use of new methods at the interface of statistics, epidemiology, causal inference, and artificial intelligence. An innovative combination of semiparametric statistical theory, causal models, and ensemble machine learning provides a unique opportunity for better results from HIV studies. In this work, we propose new estimators of the risk (or survival) function. These new estimators improve accuracy, accommodate competing events, allow effects to be generalized to specific populations of interest, incorporate machine learning of nuisance functions to relax assumptions about model form, and allow sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact of uncontrolled biases. The specific aims are vehicles to develop, test, and disseminate these new estimators. These aims are to 1) estimate the long-term treated history of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in this large US cohort of women with HIV; 2) estimate the observational analog of the per-protocol parameter using a treatment decision design to compare composite endpoints under an integrase-inhibitor-based treatment compared to an efavirenz-based treatment in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design; 3) estimate the per-protocol parameter for TDF-FTC versus ABC-3TC arms; and 4) estimate the per- protocol parameter for 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate versus masked placebo on risk of preterm birth in Zambian HIV+ pregnant women. The assembled team features field-leading expertise in epidemiology, statistics, and HIV medicine. Scientific products will include publications and workshop presentations describing new methodological approaches and new substantive findings that emerge after applying the proposed methods to each of the problems identified in the specific aims. We will also produce publicly available R packages and SAS macros to implement the proposed estimators.

"Role of anal microbiota, local cytokines and HIV in persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus While uncommon in the general population, there is a marked (60-130 fold) increased risk of anal cancer in HIV-infected individuals, especially men who have sex with men (MSM). Anal cancer is caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) that persists in the anal epithelium. It is currently not known whether HIV infection alters the anal micro environment, specifically the microbiota and cytokines, to increase persistence and eventually promote frank malignancy. The goals of the K07 are to undertake formal training and mentoring in microbiota, mucosal immunity, and molecular biology of carcinogenesis and to learn how to rigorously integrate these components analytically to identify cancer prevention markers. Therefore, our aims are to: 1) characterize the composition of the anal microbiota using hierarchical clustering and assess cluster membership with a persistently detected HR-HPV a year later for HIV- negative and HIV-positive men; 2) determine local cytokine profiles from anal swabs and assess their independent and mediating associations with persistent and non-persistent HR-HPV for those with and without HIV; and 3) describe the stability of cluster membership over time and whether that distinguishes persistence among HIV-negative and HIV-positive men. To achieve these aims, we propose to evaluate prospectively these mucosal interactions using archived anal swab samples from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected MSM in an ongoing well characterized cohort, the TRUST/RV368 study in Nigeria (R01AI20913-01). Dr. Rebecca Nowak is an exceptional candidate whose research focuses on the mechanisms of HPV transformation during HIV infection. Much of her research has originated in Uganda, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria which has resulted in her focus on global cancer research, one of the priorities for the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Nowak has strong institutional support from the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. She will have guaranteed protected research time and access to a wealth of resources that will ensure a successful transition to an independently funded investigator. Her robust training plan includes: 1) high quality mentorship from her primary mentor, Dr. Kevin Cullen, as well as co-mentors in the field of microbiome (Dr. Jacque Ravel), biostatistics (Dr. Soren Bentzen), mucosal immunology (Dr. Raina Fichorova); 2) coursework in fundamental immunology with a focus on the mucosa; 3) training in bioinformatics; and 4) experience in multidisciplinary team science. With the training and experience, Dr. Nowak will be prepared to seek R01 funding to establish a multidisciplinary research program in carcinogenic viruses during HIV infection. Public Health Narrative: Anal cancer risk is increasing in men who have sex with men, dually infected with HIV and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV). Given their history of sexual intercourse, many of these men are ineligible for the HPV vaccines. The proposed study assesses the role of microbiota and cytokines in the anal mucosa on persistence of HR-HPV to identify immune pathways that may increase regression of precancerous lesions to prevent anal cancer.","Role of anal microbiota, local cytokines and HIV in persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus",9748468,K07CA225403,"['Age', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anal canal', 'Anus', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Cell physiology', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Coitus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epithelium', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV risk', 'HIV therapy', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Human', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Human papillomavirus 16', 'Immune', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Maryland', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nigeria', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Squamous intraepithelial lesion', 'Swab', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Uterine Lesion', 'Virus', 'Woman', 'Zimbabwe', 'anticancer research', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cohort', 'commensal bacteria', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'vaginal microbiome', 'virology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K07,2019,135432,0.09591120794655998

"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health.

This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9503952,R01CA225845,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alcohols', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Influenza', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Stream', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Surveillance', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'computer cluster', 'computerized', 'drinking', 'early onset', 'handheld mobile device', 'innovation', 'movie', 'movie exposure', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco exposure', 'translational medicine']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,627735,0.07564323528645792
"A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Effectiveness of Ablative Treatments for Cervical-Cancer Risk Reduction in HIV+ Women living in Mozambique Invasive cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience almost 90% of the global cervical-cancer burden, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiencing the highest rates of cervical cancer. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which also disproportionately affects SSA, greatly increases the risk of cervical cancer. The World Health Organization now has a call-to-action for the elimination of cervical cancer, which includes vaccination young adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV), the obligate viral cause of cervical cancer, and screening mid-adult women for the early detection and treatment of cervical abnormalities before becoming cancerous. However, both the best strategy for treating cervical abnormalities in women living with HIV (WLWH) from SSA and how to mitigate treatment failures are unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose a randomized clinical trial to assess the treatment effectiveness of two ablative methods of treatment, gas-based cryotherapy and thermocoagulation, for treatment of CIN2/3 and high-risk HPV in WLWH women. Eligible, confirmed WLWH women (n=5,014), ages 25-49 years, and living in Maputo, Mozambique, in conjunction with the local PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) program, will be recruited to participate in this trial when attending their routine HIV-care visit. Consenting WLWH will be screened by rapid, point-of-care hrHPV DNA testing, unaided visual inspection after acetic acid (VIA), and “deep learning”-derived, automated visual evaluation (AVE) algorithm applied to a digital image captured on a cell phone, thereby ensuring that most CIN2/3 in the population is identified and treated. Screen-positive (HPV, VIA, 6-mo AVE positive) women will be 1) randomly assigned to either the GBC or thermocoagulation, 2) undergo a rigorous colposcopic evaluation and biopsies to determine the (post-hoc) diagnosis of the cervical abnormality, and 3) undergo their assigned treatment if ablation eligibility or LEEP if ineligible based on WHO guidelines8. Adverse events and pain data will be collected systematically during the treatment visit and during an at-home, one month post-treatment visit by community health workers. Six- and 18-month follow-up visits will be used to assess effectiveness of these treatments against CIN2/3 and hrHPV. Nested studies will evaluate whether 1) specific HPV genotypes, CD4 and HIV viral load, and/or lesion size, location, and severity (i.e. imperfect adherence to WHO guidelines), are risk factors for treatment failures by each method and 2) deep-learning algorithms applied to digital images can predict ablative treatment failures and thereby used in the future to triage screen-positive women to LEEP instead of ablation and thereby potentially be avoided those treatment failures. Secondary analyses will assess the effectiveness of 12 different S&T strategies based on different combinations of 6 screening methods (hrHPV with no triage, hrHPV with triage using HPV genotype groups, hrHPV with VIA triage, hrHPV with AVE triage, VIA alone, or AVE alone) and two ablative methods. Project Narrative Women living in sub-Saharan Africa with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at the greatest risk of getting and dying from cervical cancer. The proposed study will compare two methods of treating cervical abnormalities for the prevention of cervical cancer in Mozambican women living with HIV. Goals of the study are to identify the best treatment and reduce treatment failures in these women.",A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Effectiveness of Ablative Treatments for Cervical-Cancer Risk Reduction in HIV+ Women living in Mozambique,9927140,R01CA239921,"['Ablation', 'Acetic Acids', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Cervical dysplasia', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Cold Therapy', 'Community Health Aides', 'Consent', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electricity', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Generations', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Hand', 'Health Priorities', 'Home environment', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Local anesthesia', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mozambique', 'Necrosis', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Pain', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Safety', 'Screening Result', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Speculums', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Topical application', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Triage', 'Vaccination', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'alternative treatment', 'automated visual evaluation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'global health', 'health training', 'light weight', 'loop electrosurgical excision procedure', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mortality', 'point of care', 'portability', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'treatment comparison', 'virtual']",NCI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,151082,0.039417545443366404
"Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening Project Abstract/Summary: Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI- supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen- and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening. Project Narrative We propose to investigate the accuracy and implementation potential of a new technology that provides an automated and almost instant classification of cervical cancer precursor lesions based on a cloud-based, machine-learning algorithm of an image of the cervix. We will investigate the clinical utility of this new technology for integrating into screen-and-treat programs for women living with and without HIV in South Africa.",Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening,10082877,R01CA254576,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Cytology', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'FDA approved', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'Health Services', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Primary Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'automated visual evaluation', 'base', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk population', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening program', 'success', 'viral DNA']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,555125,0.02748937966173433

"SERVICES FOR SYNTHESIZING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT TREATMENTS FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER In response to PHS 2020-1,Topic 019 entitled, “Data Science Tools for Accelerating Alcohol Research”, Netrias and the Waggoner Center for Alcohol and Addiction Research (WCAAR) propose to develop ASSIST, a data science platform that will use deep learning to aid alcohol researchers in the discovery of drug targets clinically linked to Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). ASSIST introduces a novel deep learning algorithm, the Deep Response Model, which is a data-driven approach to discover multi-target transcriptomic profiles clinically linked to AUD. These targets can then be used to identify new treatments that have the potential to reduce addiction to alcohol and prevent relapse. State-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques rely on enrichment analysis tools that utilize imprecise knowledgebases, curated from unrelated diseases and model systems, and only cover a fraction of genes for which annotation exists. This leads to a low success rate in the identification of targets clinically linked to AUD. Instead, ASSIST will take a data-driven approach to learn higher level mappings between genes and their impact on disease state directly from transcriptomic data. Netrias will develop computational tests that will measure the accuracy, robustness, and specificity of the discovered targets to AUD. ASSIST will then integrate with drug databases to identify treatments that will reverse the expression profiles of the discovered set of targets. n/a",SERVICES FOR SYNTHESIZING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT TREATMENTS FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER,10272788,5N94020C00002,"['Alcohols', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"NETRIAS, LLC",N43,2020,224865,0.11006630486502124
