"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals. PROJECT NARRATIVE People vary considerably not just in how much they sleep, but also in the types of sleep they typically have. Standard approaches to describing sleep, primarily developed in the 1960s, only partially capture this variability: we propose to use a range of measures, including brain activity, on over ten thousand sleeping individuals to generate more accurate, data-driven, personalized profiles of how a person's sleep varies over a night. Sleep factors are associated with multiple physical and neuropsychiatric illnesses, and so better measurement of the underlying processes will be critical for future genetic and biomarker studies aimed at understanding the links between sleep, health and disease.",Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling,10084929,R01HL146339,"['Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Label', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mythology', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stage I Sleep', 'Stage II Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stretching', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'heuristics', 'implicit bias', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular scale', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'sleep health', 'sleep onset', 'tool', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,444813
"Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots PROJECT SUMMARY When Confucius said, “Tell me who are your friends, and I’ll tell you who you are,” he was noticing that how we behave and communicate is shaped by who we choose to hang out with every day. We constantly mimic the mannerisms and behaviors of friends and loved ones. Yet the neural basis of how we imitate, and more importantly who we choose to emulate and why, is largely unknown. Parrots provide a powerful yet untapped model system for social learning. Parrots, like humans and non-human primates, live in a specific type of ‘fission- fusion’ social network in which making and maintaining friendships is the key to fitness. Like humans, they selectively imitate and learn the names of their carefully selected companions. Here we aim to launch parrots as a new animal model in systems neuroscience. In aims 1, we will record neural activity in the vocal motor cortical output of the song system (nucleus AAC) in pairs of budgerigars engaged in courtship interactions. In these first- ever neural recordings form awake, behaving parrots, we are finding that AAC neurons exhibit premotor signals for vocalizations (as expected) and for expressive gestures such as silent kissing, head-bobbing and allogrooming. This joint vocal and gestural neural control, observed in human Broca’s area but not in songbirds – means that what was thought to be a songbird-like ‘song system’ is actually a more general system for social interaction. We next test the causal relationship between song system activity and social behavior. Inactivating AAC during courtship interactions will test if/how vocalizations and gestures degrade or lose their coordination (Aim 2.1). Inactivating frontal or posterior cortical inputs to AAC in bonded pairs will test the songbird-inspired idea that variability and order depend on distinct cortical pathways (Aim 2.2). For each inactivation experiment, a pair of interacting birds is conceptualized as a single dynamical system – and we will use machine learning guided behavioral analysis to quantify how vocalizations and gestures change (or do not) in both the inactivated and non-inactivated partner. Finally, in Aim 3 we will image dopamine (DA) release using fiber photometry and genetically encoded DA sensors. Pilot data demonstrate feasibility of DA imaging in singing birds. These experiments will test for the first time if DA signals, known to evaluate the quality of reward outcomes, similarly evaluate social outcomes. Courtship dynamics are perfect because gestural ‘requests’ to allogroom or ‘kiss’ are rejected or accepted with visually and acoustically obvious ‘consent’ or ‘deny’ signals. Males make hundreds of advances per day and use female feedback to learn – providing natural trial structure, within-session learning, and ‘events’ to which we can align simultaneously recorded male and female DA signals – which may or may not come into alignment as a pair ‘decides’ to bond or not. Budgerigar interactions resemble human conversations – a back-and-forth of vocalizations and gestures that both communicate agonistic or affiliative signals and control vocal learning and partner selection. Together, these experiments will help establish parrots as a new model system in social neuroscience and will ready us for a follow-up R01 submission in two years. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Humans thrive or suffer on the basis of social acceptance and rejection, but little is known about what goes on in the brain during high-stakes social interactions. Here, we will perform the first-ever neural recordings from socializing parrots to test how vocalizations and communicative gestures are coordinated during courtship and how the outcomes of romantic advances are encoded in the dopamine system.",Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots,10207958,R34NS121898,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Active Learning', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Back', 'Beak', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Broca&apos', 's area', 'Cannulas', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Consent', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Courtship', 'Data', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Generations', 'Gestures', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Melopsittacus', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Names', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pair Bond', 'Parakeets', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photometry', 'Primates', 'Psittacidae', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'awake', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'court', 'dopamine system', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microphone', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social', 'social communication', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'sound', 'stereotypy', 'vocal control', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,689222
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,10183334,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translational Research', 'Wireless Technology', 'affiliative behavior', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mature animal', 'microphone', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound', 'source localization', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2021,618061
"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults. This proposal promises to identify new treatment targets for the prevention of stress-related psychopathology.",ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES,10256803,R01MH121735,"['5 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brothers', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Heritability', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Inherited', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Primates', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Puberty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxiety-like behavior', 'anxious temperament', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'brain circuitry', 'child depression', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'emerging adult', 'emotional behavior', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genetic pedigree', 'girls', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'mature animal', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'preadolescence', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,743109
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240
"A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis Project Summary/Abstract: The research and training plan for this Fellowship will provide the applicant with significant and foundational training in cognitive neuroscience, advanced computational approaches and neuroimaging analysis to support her long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher dedicated to enhancing functional recovery in schizophrenia. A core feature of schizophrenia is severe disability in social functioning, which places a high burden on individuals and society. Effective treatment development for social functioning deficits is hindered by the lack of well-defined neural and cognitive treatment targets. Recent advances suggest cortical loss in prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be linked to poor functioning in chronic schizophrenia, however the relationship between specific neural targets and social functioning in first episode psychosis (FEP), when individuals may have greater ability to engage in substantial recovery, is largely unknown. Further, social cognition deficits are strongly linked to poor functioning, but the relationship between cortical loss in social cognitive brain regions and social functioning remains to be established. The purpose of this study is to employ data-driven approaches to identify neural and social cognitive markers of social functioning in health and FEP to inform treatment target identification. This cross-sectional, secondary analysis leverages two unique datasets – a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=1113), and a sample of FEP participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Minnesota (n=40). Specific Aim 1 - examine the relationships between gray matter volume and cortical thickness, social cognition and social functioning in healthy young adults using data driven approaches - will answer two research questions: 1a) what brain regions estimate better social functioning in healthy young adults, using regression-based machine learning analysis? and 1b) Is the relationship between social functioning and measures of gray matter volume and cortical thickness mediated by social cognition? We will then translate these findings to an FEP sample in Aim 2 - characterize the relationship between gray matter volume and cortical thickness and social functioning in FEP. This research will be supported by the applicant’s comprehensive training plan, her interdisciplinary mentoring team, and an ideal training environment due to its sophisticated neuroimaging and health informatics resources. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between the brain, social cognition and social functioning, which could lead to more targeted interventions for functional deficits in schizophrenia, alleviating suffering and addressing a critical public health need. The training will position the applicant to continue her trajectory to an independent career in translational cognitive neuroscience to enhance functional recovery through the development of neuroscience-informed interventions. Project Narrative: This research will identify relationships between neural substrate, social cognition and social functioning in healthy and first episode psychosis samples in order to identify the bio-behavioral processes that support social functioning and to identify potential neural treatment targets for improving social functioning deficits in psychotic disorders. This research aligns with the National Institute of Mental Health priority of elucidating the neural processes of complex behaviors to inform novel treatments. Identification of treatment biomarkers for social functioning is critical in order to advance treatment development and optimization for functional deficits in psychosis that will result in significant public health impact by reducing disability and promoting quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis,10153037,F31MH124278,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Development', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'aged', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'connectome', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'first episode psychosis', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social relationships', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'treatment optimization', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2021,41879
"Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a peak onset during adolescence. While interventions are moderately effective for many adolescents, 40 to 70% will relapse within 5 years. Further, MDD relapse predicts academic difficulties, risky behaviors, and suicide. Thus, identifying mechanisms of MDD relapse is critical to clarify intervention targets for this significant public health problem.  During adolescence, social processes and dynamics (especially with peers) are particularly significant, although it is unclear which social processes are most critical to MDD relapse. The present study focuses on the role of social communication, a set of mechanisms involving the receiving and delivery of socially relevant information. Social communication is especially significant to adolescents, as maladaptive social communication can negatively impact the establishment and maintenance of relationships, thus increasing risk for MDD relapse.  For the proposed study, we will employ an NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) lens and use multiple measures (behavior, event-related potentials [ERPs], eye tracking) to compare adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with remitted depression (remMDD; N=200) to healthy controls (HC; N=100) on deficits in several aspects of social communication, including: (i) processing of nonverbal social information, (ii) processing of socioemotional feedback, and (iii) digital communication. First, Aim 1 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process two types of nonverbal social information—facial expressions (as indexed by reduced accuracy and abnormal ERPs [i.e., the N170]) and hand gesturing behaviors (assessed via eye-tracking). Second, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process socioemotional feedback (being accepted versus rejected by same-aged peers), a well-established trigger of adolescent MDD. Specifically, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit a reduced Late Positive Potential [LPP]), an ERP indexing emotional encoding, following positive social feedback from faux peers during a peer evaluation task. Third, using an innovative smartphone app, Aim 3 will collect multiple indicators of digital communication regarding the structure of adolescents’ digital social network (i.e., size of the network; frequency of communication) and sentiment of the communication with their digital social network (i.e., coding sentiment from their texts, social media posts); allowing us to test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit abnormal digital communication. Last, we will follow adolescents for 1-year to determine whether processing of nonverbal information, social feedback, and digital communication predict the escalation of depression symptoms and MDD relapse. Further, supervised machine learning will explore which social communication deficit(s) predict symptoms or MDD relapse, and whether these social processes predict outcomes independent of (or interaction with) other established predictors of relapse (e.g., stressful life events). In summary, the project has the promise to identify social process that contribute to recurrent depression, which, ultimately, will lead to innovative treatment approaches. Project Narrative Depression in adolescence is common and recurrent. While social processes and dynamics are particularly significant in adolescence, it is unclear which social processes are most critical to depression relapse. The present study uses an RDoC “lens” to examine the role of multiple aspects of social communication to determine which social communication deficit predicts the escalation of depression symptoms and relapse during a 1-year follow-up period.",Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression,10064641,R01MH119771,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Social Network', 'Social Processes', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Youth', 'aged', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'negative affect', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'recurrent depression', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'showing emotion', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,720319
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.  REL EVAN CE (Se e in stru cti ons): The proposed research will develop and field test an innovative computationally-enabled personalized behavior change model that will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and is designed to be integrated into clinical practice.

"The Pathophysiological Role of Cerebellar Glia in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rett  syndrome  (RTT)  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  intellectual  disability  in  girls  and  women.  Individuals  with  RTT  develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  and  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2  (MECP2)  occur  in  >95%  of  RTT  cases.  Initially,  researchers  regarded  MeCP2  deficiency  in  neurons  as  the  exclusive  cause  of  RTT.  However,  recent  studies  have  revealed  that  glia  have  a  pathological  role  in  RTT  etiology. Studies have not yet uncovered the underlying cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction in Mecp2  rodent  models  or  the  impact  of  this  dysfunction  on  brain  function.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution  of  a  specific  glial  subtype,  Bergmann  glia  cells  (BGs)  in  the  cerebellum,  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT.  We  will  focus  on  BGs  because  (1)  cerebellar  disruption  likely  contributes  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT  and  (2)  BGs  are  the  major  glial  subtype  in  the  cerebellum.  We  propose  to  characterize  cerebellar  function  in  conditional  knockout  (cKO)  mice  that  lack  Mecp2  in  BGs  using  a  repertoire  of  approaches,  including  intracellular  whole-­cell  recordings,  in  vivo  recordings  of  single  units  and  local  field  potentials,  in  vivo  and  ex  vivo  imaging  of  genetically-­encoded  Ca2+,  glutamate,  and  dopamine  (DA)  sensors  (GCaMP7,  iGluSnFr,  and  dLight1.1,  respectively),  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  near  super-­resolution  confocal  microscopy,  and  behavioral  assessments  using  unbiased  machine-­learning  approaches.  Our  preliminary results indicate deficits in BGs from Mecp2-­deficient mice, including higher expression levels of the  GluA1  subunit  of  AMPA  receptors  (AMPARs),  and  depolarized  membrane  potentials.  In  addition,  we  have  preliminary evidence of DAergic modulation of BGs through the activation of D1 receptors (D1Rs) activated by  either electrical or optogenetic stimulation of DAergic inputs to the cerebellum. Of high relevance to motor and  social symptoms in RTT, the expression levels of D1Rs, which modulate GluA1 surface insertion, are higher in  Mecp2  KO  mice.  We  hypothesize  that  BGs  in  the  cerebellum  have  a  pathophysiological  role  in  motor  and  social  deficits  in  Mecp2-­deficient  mice.  We  propose  two  Aims:  (1)  Define  cerebellar  BG  dysfunction  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice;;  (2)  Characterize  DAergic  modulation  of  cerebellar  BGs  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice.  The  proposed  studies  will elucidate the consequences of impaired DAergic modulation of astrocyte function on cerebellar-­dependent  behaviors,  which  will  have  broad  implications  not  only  for  RTT  but  also  for  other  brain  disorders  associated  with cerebellar dysfunction.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by MECP2 mutations, presents with stereotypic hand movements, ambulatory difficulties, and social impairments.

"Robust Characterization of Brain-Heart Coupling Across Development and Modulations by Disordered Sleep ABSTRACT Balanced communication between the brain and heart is critical to both cardiovascular and cognitive health. Although the anatomical pathways facilitating this communication have been well characterized, the electrodynamic coupling between the two systems remains elusive, particularly during development. A distributed network of brain structures that regulates cardiac function undergoes profound changes and reorganization during the first two decades of life. The impact of these anatomical changes and postnatal heart maturation on cerebro-cardiovascular coupling is poorly understood. Yet, this is a fundamental mechanism that, if impaired, may lead to significant deficits in both systems. At the macroscale of the intact human brain and heart, simultaneously acquired electrophysiological data may provide transformative new insights into both electrodynamic system coupling and its modulation by disorders and stressors. To date, the adverse effects of such stressors, particularly unhealthy sleep associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a disorder that affects up to 10% of children in the US, on this electrodynamic coupling during wakefulness and sleep remain poorly understood. This project aims to significantly improve the field’s knowledge through two potentially transformative contributions. Aim 1 will develop a blueprint of normal electrodynamic interaction between the developing brain and heart, during wakefulness and sleep, by leveraging the large volume of existing data from clinical physiological studies (which include both EEG and ECG) from patients with no evidence of underlying disease. A total of n ~= 1400 patients, with simultaneous EEG and ECG, spanning in age infancy to young adulthood will be analyzed using cutting-edge signal and machine learning tools and models, to establish a typical developmental trajectory of the electrodynamic interaction between the brain and heart. Aim 2 will use this blueprint to systematically investigate the adverse impact of disordered sleep on cerebro-cardiovascular coupling in 453 children with OSA (ages 5-10 years) and ~400 children with snoring (who did not meet criteria for OSA), using publicly available polysomnography data from the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). Dynamic EEG-ECG interactions at baseline and follow up will be compared to normal system coupling in the same age range, estimated in Aim 1. Deviations from normative coupling will be investigated as a function of cognitive outcomes. Clinical physiology/polysomnography studies contain a wealth of valuable information but remain severely underutilized. This project will leverage these Big Data to robustly characterize a fundamental yet currently elusive mechanism that may affect both cognitive and cardiovascular health across the lifespan. In addition, the establishment of a normative developmental trajectory of cerebro-cardiovascular coupling may become a significant research resource for future studies. Findings may provide transformative insights into the communication between the two organs, necessary to maintain their respective long-term health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using novel signal processing and machine learning tools and Big Physiological Data from existing clinical studies and the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT), this project aims to first develop a blueprint of electrodynamic cardiovascular-neural coupling during wakefulness and sleep and robustly characterize its developmental trajectory. This blueprint of the two systems’ electrodynamic interaction will then be used to elucidate the adverse impact of disordered sleep (as a result of Obstructive Sleep Apnea), in children age 5-10 years. Findings from this project may have a transformative impact on the field’s understanding of the dynamic communication between the brain and heart and its modulation by unhealthy/insufficient sleep, a significant problem in children with potentially profound implications for cognitive and cardiovascular health across the lifespan.",Robust Characterization of Brain-Heart Coupling Across Development and Modulations by Disordered Sleep,10293076,R21HL156186,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Snoring', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Wakefulness', 'arm', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical database', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'critical period', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'heart function', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'sleep quality', 'stressor', 'tool', 'young adult']",NHLBI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,132750
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,10079453,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'diarrheal disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health', 'urban setting']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2021,127872
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,10102645,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'community partnership', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'perceived stress', 'pressure', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep difficulty', 'sleep health', 'social', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,855472
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,10164863,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2021,694636
"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury. It will provide multi-level evidence on the impact of the psychosocial and environmental factors on insufficient sleep among blacks.

"Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups Abstract A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research. The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time- consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies. Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression. Narrative The primary goal of this project is to use network analyses to construct a Feeding Interaction Network using automated feeding data collected from animals living in large breeding groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. If successful, these models will identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of fighting and injury. The application of automated feeding data in the social management of captive colonies of rhesus macaques represents a paradigm shift from more conventional practices.",Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups,10090122,R24OD030035,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Breeding', 'Case Study', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Ovulation', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primates', 'Progesterone', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'affiliative behavior', 'animal resource', 'behavior observation', 'cohesion', 'feeding', 'fighting', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'network models', 'pregnant', 'reproductive', 'season of birth', 'social', 'social attachment', 'social relationships', 'social unrest', 'wound']",OD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2021,802738
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,10199050,R01LM012974,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Semantics', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'behavior change', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'digital', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'network models', 'nicotine patch', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'supervised learning', 'virtual coach']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,343235
"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep. In the third specific aim, we will probe the essence of sleep replay further, by exposing animals to multiple novel and familiar maze environments prior to long durations of sleep. In the fourth specific aim, we will perform closed-loop disruption of neuronal population patterns to  examine the causal interplay and reverberation of these patterns from early to late sleep. In summary, our  proposal is designed to provide strongest characterization to date of the structure of ""noise"" in replay events. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This study will provide an opening to evaluate the role of sleep in reorganizing information in the brain and  help to identify critical time windows and neuronal activities during sleep which are particularly important  for information storage and stabilization. Our assumptions and deductions about the nature and purpose  of sleep implicitly inform all manner of public policy, from the durations of shifts for hospital and relief  workers, to morning start times of public schools.

"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,10162319,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,71390
"Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American ABSTRACT  Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity. Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.  We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin” and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.  The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health problems. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study will provide new information about how social stressors contribute to obesity among Mexican and Filipino American women. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that stressors lead to eating behaviors and dietary changes and that alter the brain-gut-microbiome axis. A better understanding of the role of how stress “gets under the skin” to contribute to alterations in the brain and gut microbial metabolites in obesity, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies tailored to treat altered ingestive behaviors and obesity.",Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American,10129475,R01MD015904,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Aromatic Amino Acids', 'Asians', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calories', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Fibrinogen', 'Filipino American', 'Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratio', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Neurologic', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Social Discrimination', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tryptophan', 'Woman', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'craving', 'dietary', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'food consumption', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'immune activation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'social culture', 'social stressor', 'stool sample', 'stressor', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning', 'waist circumference']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,779086
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY – Parent U01  Emerging adulthood (ages 18-29 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance; therefore, to ad- dress this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, re- active processes are difficult to measure because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect inten- sive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. Data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within- days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learn- ing to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and meth- ods will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Network’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE - Parent U01 Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults.

"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games.

"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10420051,F32NS114034,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Board Certification', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetative States', 'Wakefulness', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'life-sustaining therapy', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'stimulus processing', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2021,32997
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,10067382,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,680832
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,10150095,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,660945
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,10119327,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,641065
"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram.

"Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel, computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2) the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and “pose” estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective, we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models (Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new methods to investigate the neural circuits governing naturalistic social behaviors in animal models, and such behaviors are often disrupted in human psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. Our objective is to use computer vision and machine learning algorithms (AI) to produce detailed and reproducible measurements capturing the richness of social behaviors, and to correlate those behaviors with simultaneously recorded neural activity in freely interacting animals. We apply these techniques in established and novel social behavior assays to test hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying social behavioral decision-making.","Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice",10226273,R01MH123612,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Reciprocal Social Interaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Identification', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'body position', 'collaborative approach', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social defeat', 'social structure', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,416250
"Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships Project Summary Infants communicate to their caregivers that they need food by crying. This represents our very first social interaction that lays the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing a strong social bond with caregivers. Infants that cannot regulate their nutrition are at risk for malnourishment or obesity, whose deleterious effects will negatively impact the wellness of these individuals for their lifetime. Abnormalities in social recognition and communication, like those found in autism spectrum disorders, also become apparent during infancy. Despite the critical importance of infants communicating nutritional need to caregivers, the neuronal basis remains unknown. To address this deficit, I propose to study social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing. Tadpoles use this begging display to encode nutritional state, enabling us to quantify hunger- based communication. These tadpoles are translucent, allowing us to visualize the development and activity of neurons in the brain. I am combining this novel model system and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to interrogate the neuronal substrates of hunger-based communication. I will examine whether nutritional quality influences the development of neurons that regulating feeding and communication with in vivo brain imaging. I will also test for a functional role of these neuronal cell-types in begging behavior using a high throughput behavior assay, whole brain clearing and immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific manipulations of neuronal activity. As social recognition is important for establishing parent-offspring bonds, I will then use in vivo neural activity imaging to determine how tadpoles recognize their parents using multi-modal sensory integration. Completion of these experiments will transform our understanding of a social behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing. There is a pressing need for this research because there are currently no established models for studying the neural mechanisms of infant communication of hunger. This work is important to public health because some of the most prevalent disorders afflicting children in the United States are eating related disorders and conditions involving abnormalities in social recognition and communication, such as autism spectrum disorders. More research on infant feeding and communication is needed to better understand these pathologies in the youngest members of our society. Narrative Communication of nutritional need during infancy is our very first social interaction, laying the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing strong social bonds with caregivers. The proposed work uses a unique biological model – social tadpoles that communicate nutritional need to their caregivers – to uncover how infants evaluate their nutritional state, recognize their caregivers, and communicate that they need food. These studies have implications for informing preventative strategies and treatments for childhood obesity and autism spectrum disorders, two of the most prevalent diseases afflicting the youngest members of our society.",Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships,10263607,DP2HD102042,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Critical Thinking', 'Crying', 'Dancing', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Eating', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Life', 'Methodology', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Study models', 'Tadpoles', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'member', 'multimodality', 'neurogenetics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity in children', 'offspring', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social attachment', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,86547
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743
"An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support ABSTRACT Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes, clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources. We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in 44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006- 2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR- SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis, informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2). We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR- based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support- cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities.

"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10167793,K99MH124435,"['Affect', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'mind control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'recruit', 'redshift', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'social competition', 'social deficits', 'social interventions', 'social neuroscience', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,123390
"Sleep Based Memory Consolidation in Juvenile Zebra Finch Project Summary Sleep is thought to play a significant contribution in the consolidation of multiple forms of memories during development. Transient disruptions of sleep often lead to delays and losses in learned skilled behaviors. While research has made great progress in understanding the role of sleep in the hippocampal dependent learning of explicit memories, how sleep influences the synaptic circuits involved in learning perceptual and procedural memories is still poorly understood. Songbirds provide an unmatched opportunity to study sleep based consolidation of skilled motor behaviors. Juvenile songbirds learn their courtship song through extensive daily practice, producing tens of thousands of renditions by adulthood. Daily, auditory-feedback guided improvements in song are hypothesized to be consolidated nightly during sleep, enabling renewed vocal exploration and continued refinement of song performances through development. My predoctoral research seeks to identify the synaptic circuits involved in sleep-based consolidation of song and the long-term impact of transient disruptions in these circuits during song development. By combining in vivo pharmacological manipulations with machine learning-based approaches for segregating and analyzing changes in singing behavior, I have identified at least one nuclei governing the sleep-based consolidation of complex motor behaviors. Remaining work to be done during the F99 phase will focus on the specific contributions of individual premotor synaptic circuits using synapse-specific pharmacology in conjunction with pathway specific chemogenetics. Also during the F99 phase, I will follow up on unexpected findings to determine the evolutionary relevance of song diversity in mate choice. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide a specific plan to find an ideal mentor and research environment for enhancing my knowledge and technical skills of neuroinvasion and propagation of viruses leading to generation of novel viral vectors for the effective dissection of neural circuits. Together, the research and training detailed in the two phases of this proposal will allow me to achieve my long-term goal of engineering sophisticated tools to understand the molecular, cellular, and synaptic basis of learned complex motor behaviors as a tenured principal investigator. Project Narrative Although the role of sleep has been studied in many different contexts, little effort has been dedicated to understanding the role of sleep in the acquisition of communicativebehaviors. With a well-defined neural circuitry underlying a robust and stereotyped learned behavior, along with evidence pointing to changes in song structure during sleep, the songbird is exceptionally suited for examining sleep-based learning mechanisms. Byidentifying circuits mechanisms involved in memory consolidation we will stand better equipped to help those affected by sleep disturbances.",Sleep Based Memory Consolidation in Juvenile Zebra Finch,10319443,F99NS124172,"['Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Complex', 'Courtship', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Female', 'Gene Delivery', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mate Selections', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Tropism', 'Uncertainty', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Virus', 'Work', 'auditory feedback', 'base', 'bird song', 'deep learning', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'innovation', 'learned behavior', 'male', 'memory consolidation', 'motor behavior', 'neural circuit', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pathogenic virus', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'preference', 'pressure', 'procedural memory', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tutoring', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F99,2021,37499
"Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder Project Summary Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms, combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically, we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD, using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions, providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient- psychotherapist interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both borderline and avoidant personality disorders are marked by profound impairments in interpersonal functioning. However, the brain mechanisms underlying these social deficits are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better elucidate how the brain is involved in complex social interactions and the clinical relevance of these processes for personality disorders.","Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder",10234509,R01MH123069,"['Assertiveness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer framework', 'geometric structure', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,648979
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit.

Understanding youth appeal of e- cigarettes and marketing strategies targeting youth is critical to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s goal to prevent youth e-cigarette use. A significant youth appeal is the ability to modify e-cigarettes or to “hack” the devices or e-liquid constituents for unintended purposes (e.g., using at higher temperatures or for a longer period of time, adding their own e-liquids made with nicotine or THC oil). However, it is largely unknown how youth modify e-cigarette devices or their components, their perceptions of these behaviors, and marketing strategies used to endorse these behaviors. YouTube, a popular social media, can be examined to understand modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing associated with these behaviors. The overall goal of this study is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or “hack” the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim. The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified, restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on YouTube, and develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of engaging in these behaviors.",Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube,10170329,R01DA049878,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine', 'Oils', 'Perception', 'Plug-in', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Toxicology', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'demographics', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic liquid', 'experience', 'male', 'marijuana vaping', 'novel', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'sex', 'social', 'social media', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco regulatory science', 'vaping', 'web site']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,444903
"Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning PROJECT SUMMARY Expressive social behaviors, including speech and music, are culturally transmitted from a tutor to a pupil. Such learning depends on a pupil’s ability to integrate social and sensory cues provided by a tutor performing the relevant behavior. Once learned, the underlying motor program must be coordinated with a range of innate motor programs to generate holistic behaviors necessary to effective social signaling. The central hypothesis that this proposal seeks to test is that the same brain circuitry that enables the pupil to integrate social and sensory cues from an adult tutor also function in the adult to enable integration of the learned and innate programs necessary to effective social signaling. In the past cycle, we discovered where neural signals encoding social and sensory cues provided by a tutor are integrated in the pupil’s brain. Specifically, we showed that neurons in a midbrain dopamine cell group (A11) in a juvenile songbird are selectively excited during interactions with a singing adult male tutor, and that pairing song playback with the optogenetically- triggered release of dopamine from A11 terminals in a sensorimotor cortical analogue (HVC) is sufficient to drive song copying. Despite these important insights, exactly when and how tutor experience transforms auditory and motor coding in HVC to facilitate vocal learning remains unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will use multiphoton (2p) longitudinal imaging, fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that tutor experience rapidly strengthens the auditory and motor network in the pupil’s HVC. We will also use novel machine learning tools for vocal analysis and optogenetic methods to test the idea that these sensorimotor changes enable HVC to enhance the acoustic complexity of the pupil’s song, a first step in vocal copying. Our prior studies support the idea that social and auditory cues provided by the tutor drive coincident DA release and auditory synaptic activity in the pupil’s HVC, rapidly potentiating sensorimotor synapses in this region. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will use ex vivo channelrhodopsin circuit-mapping to test the hypothesis that coincident DA release and auditory synaptic actvity rapidly potentiates auditory synapses onto HVC interneurons, and that these effects are strongest during juvenile sensitive periods for learning. Notably, the courtship display of the adult songbird includes a learned song that is seamlessly coordinated with a variety of innate behaviors, including female- directed calling, orientation, and pursuit. In Preliminary Studies, we found that lesions of A11’s axon terminals in HVC of the adult male finch abolish female-directed singing without affecting his innate courtship behaviors. In contrast, selectively ablating A11 cell bodies abolished all of the male’s courtship behaviors. In Aim 3, we will map, monitor and manipulate A11’s projections to HVC and other motor centers to test the idea that A11 acts as a central hub to enable the seamless and rapid coordination of learned and innate motor programs in response to social cues provided by a nearby female. PROJECT NARRATIVE Social learning is the foundation for speech, music and athletics but full mastery of these complex behaviors requires the fluent coordination of learned and innate motor programs. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a neural circuit comprising a midbrain dopamine cell group and its cortical and subcortical projections is crucial to social learning and the coordination of learned and innate motor programs.",Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning,10305438,R01NS099288,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Auditory', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Courtship', 'Cues', 'Dopamine', 'Emotional', 'Facial Expression', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Finches', 'Foundations', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Instinct', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Music', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Photometry', 'Preparation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Pupil', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'analog', 'brain circuitry', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'insight', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'molecular phenotype', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tutoring', 'vocal learning', 'zebra finch']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354988
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,10153459,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'efficacious treatment', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,692058
"Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks Project Summary Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup, comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental (household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks. Project Narrative Despite the high risk for sleep-related morbidity, there is a paucity of data on sleep-disrupting psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with sleep deficiency (poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment) among older blacks. Our multi-disciplinary team will use novel mHealth devices recording sleep/activity cycles, light, noise, air quality, temperature, and greenspace exposure; novel brain biomarkers; and geospatial analytics to assess effects on sleep deficiency and delineate their role in explaining disparities in the brain and cognitive health of older blacks.",Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks,10149911,R01AG067523,"['Activity Cycles', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aphorisms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shoulder', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'TNF gene', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Trail Making Test', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'age related', 'base', 'brain health', 'built environment', 'career', 'circadian', 'cognitive function', 'density', 'digital', 'disparity reduction', 'dynamic system', 'environmental change', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic minority population', 'executive function', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'poor sleep', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'psychosocial stressors', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social capital', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'translational study', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,824854
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms Mediating TMS and Oxytocin Effects on Social Cognition We are requesting an increase in the yearly direct costs to support the aims of the MERIT renewal. What we propose is a dramatic leap into the future of social neuroscience and lies at the bleeding edge of current technology. The proposed research is innovative, ambitious, and necessary for understanding how primate, and by extension human, brains enable appropriate social behavior in the real world. Our proposal advances understanding of how primate brains generate appropriate social behavior through a tightly-integrated, ambitious set of 4 specific aims combining simultaneous wireless neurophysiological recordings in multiple freely-moving monkeys interacting naturally in varied social contexts, semi-to-fully-automated quantification of social behavior using computer vision, pharmacological manipulations, and reversible perturbations of neural activity. To our knowledge, none of these experiments has ever been attempted in macaques.
