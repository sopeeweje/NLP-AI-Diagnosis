"Analysis and Prediction of Molecular Interactions Abstract Our research focuses on molecular recognition, with the goal of providing methods and software for solving biomedical problems. The primary areas of interest are protein-protein interactions and the ligand binding properties of proteins. We believe that predictive methods will be substantially improved during the next five years due to the increasing amount of information on sequences, structures, and interactions of molecules in the cell, and the unprecedented availability of computing power. To take advantage of these opportunities we will integrate the use of structural templates, co-evolutionary information, and machine learning into classical biophysical methods. Our rigid body protein docking server ClusPro, which has over 15,000 users, will be combined with our new template based server ClusPro TBM. We also add elements of flexible docking, either by remodeling the regions that cause steric conflicts, or by using a neural net for calculating post-minimization energy values without performing the actual minimization. Several tools will be combined for the structural analysis of protein interaction networks, including a novel method of constructing multi-protein complexes based on pre-calculated tables of interaction energies between pairs of proteins. Examples of applications include the design of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) for modulating a target protein by degradation, the prediction of antibody epitopes, and searching for epitope-specific antibodies. To study the ligand binding properties of proteins we focus on binding hot spots, regions of proteins that are major contributors to the binding free energy. Our FTMap server globally samples the surface of target proteins using fragment sized molecular probes and provides reliable hot spot and pharmacophore information. We will improve the scoring function using neural nets, and expand the set of probes to obtain generalized pharmacophores that identify regions in the protein binding site with preferences for specific functional groups and a number of bound fragments. Since this information can be used to find larger ligands, the goal is to convert FTMap into a fragment based ligand discovery platform. We will also improve our template-based server LigTBM, which docks small molecules to proteins, and will integrate template-based modeling with FTMap. In a collaborative application we will analyze metabolite-protein interaction data obtained by precision mass spectrometry in E. coli and human protein pull-down experiments. FTMap will be used to test whether a target protein has a suitable binding hot spot, and LigTBM will place the metabolite. We are particularly interested in finding metabolites that bind at novel allosteric regulatory sites. A related application will be to study ensembles of structures obtained by dynamic simulations to find potential correlations between FTMap derived binding properties at different regions of proteins, thus exploring potential allosteric communication. Narrative Our research focuses on molecular interactions, and we develop methods for protein-protein docking and the characterization of ligand binding properties of proteins. Predictive tools for these applications will be substantially improved by integrating classical biophysical approaches with sequence, structure, and interaction information on biological macromolecules, and by utilizing the unprecedented availability of computer power. The methods will be implemented as web-based servers for use by the biomedical research community.",Analysis and Prediction of Molecular Interactions,10175504,R35GM118078,"['Antibodies', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Docking', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Online Systems', 'Property', 'Protac', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'improved', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular recognition', 'molecular size', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'protein degradation', 'protein metabolite', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,576150
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Structural Mechanisms of Cytoskeletal Force-Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY  Cells in the body perceive cues from their local environment, which control cellular behavior through a coordinated series of molecular events known as signaling. Signaling is critically important for telling a cell if it should grow and divide, migrate to a different part of the body, or commit suicide if it has completed its function or been irreparably damaged. Frequently, signaling processes are found to be working incorrectly in diseased cells. For instance, cancer cells divide and migrate out of control and ignore cues which should keep them in check. Signals come in multiple forms. Specific molecules bind and activate cognate receptor proteins in the cell, known as “chemical signaling”, which is broadly well-understood. Physical forces and the rigidity of a cell’s environment also elicit specific cell behaviors, but we have a comparatively poor understanding of how proteins transmit these “mechanical signals”. A significant fraction of successful drugs target protein molecules which operate in chemical signaling. The development of many such treatments was stimulated by determining the detailed three-dimensional chemical structures of the interactions between receptor proteins and the molecules which activate them, facilitating the design of drugs which precisely intervene in these processes. Despite its importance, efforts to therapeutically target mechanical signaling have been limited. The long-term goal of this research project is to visualize how forces modulate the three-dimensional structure of mechanical signaling proteins to activate them, in order to facilitate the development of drugs that block these changes.  This proposal is specifically focused on understanding how cellular polymers (“filaments”) composed of the protein actin coordinate mechanical signaling. The cell contains many networks composed of actin filaments, myosin molecular motor proteins, and hundreds of other binding partners, which collectively generate and transmit diverse forces. We hypothesize that specific types of forces cause distinct physical rearrangements in actin filaments, which can be detected by other proteins in the cell through direct binding interactions. We will identify proteins which bind actin in a force-sensitive manner (Aim 1), focusing specifically on delineating the precise regions of the proteins which confer force-sensitivity. We will next visualize how side-wise bending forces (Aim 2) and length-wise tensile and compressive forces generated by myosin motor proteins (Aim 3) impact actin filament structure, hypothesizing these force regimes produce distinct rearrangements which can be discriminated by binding partners. In pursuit of these Aims, we are developing sample preparation and computational image analysis approaches to visualize the three-dimensional structure of actin polymers in the presence of mechanical forces with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In addition to providing basic insights into how forces are perceived by cells through changes in protein structure, our studies will guide the development of precise molecular interventions into mechanical signaling processes governed by actin. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Mechanical signaling is critical in development and immune function, and its dysfunction has been implicated in numerous malignancies, including cancer and cardiomyopathies. This project aims to reveal how forces alter the structure of actin filaments, the major load-bearing element of the cell. Our studies will establish basic principles of how forces alter protein structure to transmit mechanical signals, which in the long-term will guide the development of therapeutics targeting these processes.",Structural Mechanisms of Cytoskeletal Force-Sensing,10178249,R01GM141044,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actin-Binding Protein', 'Actins', 'Adhesions', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Body part', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Mechanotransduction', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Cryo-electron tomography', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cues', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'F-Actin', 'F-actin-binding proteins', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image Analysis', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Microfilaments', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vinculin', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'alpha catenin', 'base', 'calponin', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cofilin', 'comparative', 'completed suicide', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'fluid flow', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'macromolecular assembly', 'mechanical force', 'mechanotransduction', 'mutant', 'network architecture', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'receptor', 'reconstitution', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,339000

"Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Although the past two decades witnessed the large-scale analyses of cellular components, e.g. exomes, their impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. For example, 6/7 drug candidates failed safety and 3/4 failed efficacy in recent FDA clinical trials. These unsolved, but related issues, safety and efficacy, reflect significant gaps in understanding of the triangular interrelationship between diseases, molecular function, and drug treatments. A key conceptual limitation of contemporary drug discovery is the often implicitly assumed single drug for a single protein target disease model. In reality, most diseases are caused by multiple malfunctioning molecules. Whether it be disease treatment or precision medicine diagnostics, there is often an inability to identify disease-associated mode of action (MOA) proteins. To begin to address these issues, in the current MIRA proposal, we developed a promising protein structure and network-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, MEDICASCY, to predict disease-associated MOA proteins, drug indications, side effects and efficacy; however, much more needs to be done. Here, we propose to build on our successes and develop an integrated AI-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that addresses the following: The first step in determining a drug’s MOA and off-target interactions is to identity its protein targets. This requires the structures of all human proteins and their complexes. While we predicted suitable models for at least one domain in 97% of human proteins, using deep learning, we will predict the structures of the missing domains, domain-domain orientations and protein- protein complexes. We will extend small molecule virtual ligand screening (VLS) to predict binding affinities based on the insight that interacting ring-protein subpocket geometries and chemistry are conserved across protein families, are often privileged chemical structures and are likely low free energy complexes. Cryptic protein pockets, recently recognized as important drug targets, will be predicted and included in our VLS approach. Antibody-based immunotherapies are powerful but have similar safety and efficacy issues as small-molecules; thus, their safety and efficacy will be predicted by MEDICASCY-X. While MEDICASCY works on an “averaged human”, MEDICASCY-X will consider individual genetic and epigenetic profiles to make it a true precision medicine tool. We will predict which MOA proteins should be targeted and if a protein’s MOA is due to a loss or gain of function. The same framework will predict synergistic drug-drug interactions. Another way to prioritize MOA proteins is by disease comorbidity: proteins occurring in multiple diseases are likely important. If disease comorbidity can be predicted, we will construct the “Phylogenetic” Tree(s) of Diseases that would facilitate a deeper understanding of disease interrelationships. As proof of principle of the effectiveness of the algorithms being developed, novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases will be developed. Thus, this project could enhance the success rates of drug discovery and precision medicine while reducing time and cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the explosion of biological knowledge that has occurred since the turn of the century, the impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. To address the key issues limiting this success, this project will develop an AI-driven, integrated protein structure and interaction network-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that will predict disease associated proteins, identify the most effective protein targets to treat the disease and suggest effective, de-risked therapeutic strategies. MEDICASCY-X will be applied to improve drug discovery and precision medicine and will be validated by developing novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases.",Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis,10149528,R35GM118039,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Free Energy', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'cryptic protein', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'exome', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,490958
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10259801,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,399375
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10392661,R01GM136859,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Computational Technique', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'artificial neural network', 'automated analysis', 'design', 'innovation', 'insight', 'next generation', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'radio frequency', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,13250
"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,10083746,R35GM130354,"['Antibody Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV vaccine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'drug discovery', 'immunogenic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein structure function', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2021,377124

"Investigation of ssDNA binding proteins and protein-ssDNA interactions Project Summary/Abstract Molecular interactions between proteins and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) play crucial roles in many fundamental biological processes, such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, gene regulation, and genome stability. ssDNA-binding proteins encompass various degrees of binding specificity, ranging from highly specific to non-specific. Despite the critical roles of protein-ssDNA interactions in essential biological processes, the investigation of protein-ssDNA interactions lags far behind other types of protein-nucleic acids interactions, such as protein-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) interaction. Currently there are no comprehensive, well-annotated resources for studying protein- ssDNA interactions. This proposal aims to investigate the mechanism of protein-ssDNA interactions by first constructing well-annotated protein-ssDNA data resources and by performing comparative analysis at two different levels. The first is to compare structural features between protein-ssDNA complexes with different binding specificity. The second is to investigate the similarity/differences between protein- ssDNA and protein-dsDNA complexes. In addition, we propose to predict novel ssDNA binding proteins from the unannotated protein sequences by combining structure-based protein threading methods and sequence-based machine learning approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to build comprehensive data resources for studying complexes between protein and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and to investigate the structure and function of ssDNA binding proteins. Protein-ssDNA interaction is critical in many biological processes and plays essential roles in maintaining genome integrity, promoting genome stability and transcription regulation.

"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins.

"Unlocking sequence-structure-function-disease relationships in large protein super-families Project Summary Predicting disease phenotypes from genotypes is a grand challenge in biology and personalized medicine. Our long-term goal is to address this challenge using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Working towards this goal, we have developed and deployed a powerful evolutionary systems approach to map the complex relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in biomedically important protein super-families such as protein kinases. We have made important contributions describing the unique modes of allosteric regulation in various protein kinases, deciphering the structural basis of oncogenic activation in a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases, uncovering the regulation of pseudokinases, and developing new tools and resources for addressing data integration challenges in the signaling field. We propose to build on these impactful studies to answer key questions emanating from our ongoing studies such as: What are the functions of pseudokinases, the catalytically-inert members of the kinome, and how can we use pseudokinases to better predict and characterize non-catalytic functions of kinases? What are the functions of conserved cysteine residues in regulatory sites of protein and small molecule kinases and are they post-translationally modified in redox signaling and oxidative stress response that are causally associated with age-related disorders? How can we enhance existing computational models for predicting genome-phenome relationships using structural information, and can machine learning on structurally enhanced knowledge graphs reveal new relationships between patient-derived mutations and disease phenotypes? We propose to answer these questions using a variety of approaches including statistical mining of large sequence datasets, molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis and in vivo assays. Completion of this work is expected to reveal new allosteric sites for targeting pseudokinase and kinase non-catalytic functions in diseases, and significantly advance our understanding of kinase regulatory mechanisms in disease and normal states. Our work will create new tools and resources for knowledge graph mining and provide explainable models for inferring causal relationships linking genomes and phenomes with potential applications in personalized medicine. Finally, the scope and impact of our work will be significantly broadened by participation in studies extending our specialized tools and technological approaches developed for the study of kinases to other biomedically important gene families such as glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. Project Narrative Many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders are causally associated with abnormal protein kinase and glycosyltransferase functions.

While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,10268980,F31HG011185,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA lesion', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Screening Result', 'Shunt Device', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'literacy', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein degradation', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,33463
