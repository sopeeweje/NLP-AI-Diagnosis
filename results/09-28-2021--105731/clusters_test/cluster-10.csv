"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times. In this work, we will develop and validate techniques for rapid cardiac MRI in a short exam time for comprehensive CAD assessment.",Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,10171902,R01HL153146,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Back', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Gadolinium', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease diagnosis', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,487354
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10187567,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2021,310796
"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of target and OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi-organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will develop an MT-MR simulation based multi-organ auto- segmentation tool. In Aim 3, we will optimize a deep learning-based dose prediction model and assess the effectiveness of the MT-MR based RTP workflow in adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy planning of pancreatic cancer patients. Successful completion of the project will significantly promote the clinical adoption of MR simulation for abdominal RTP, which will improve treatment precision and outcomes. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in both cancer diagnosis and radiotherapy. Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi- organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10331615,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Water', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,507076
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10220967,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2021,821583
"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10217254,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,760832
"Novel Perceptual and Oculomotor Heuristics for Enhancing Radiologic Performance PROGRAM SUMMARY Radiological imaging is often the first step of the diagnostic pathway for many devastating diseases; thus, an erroneous assessment of “normal” can lead to death. Whereas a grayscale object in an image can be described by its first-order image statistics—such as contrast, spatial frequency, position, entropy, and orientation—none of these dimensions, by itself, indicates abnormal vs normal radiological findings. We are a highly diverse team proposing an empirical approach to determine the mixtures of the first-order statistics—the “visual textures”— that radiology experts explicitly and implicitly use to identify the locations of potential abnormalities in medical images. Our innovative approach does not rely on assumptions about which textures may or may not be im- portant to abnormality detection. Instead, we will track the oculomotor behavior of expert radiologists to deter- mine their conscious and unconscious targeting choices, and thus ascertain which textures are empirically in- formative. The ability of expert radiologists to rapidly find abnormalities suggests that they may be able to first identify them in their retinal periphery. Peripheral visual analysis skills are therefore potentially critical to radio- logic performance, despite being understudied. We will measure these skills and leverage the results to develop perceptual learning heuristics to improve peripheral abnormality texture detection. By comparing novices to ex- perts we will determine whether the first are inexpert due to a lack of sensitivity to diagnostically relevant textures (texture informativeness), or to a lack of knowledge about which textures are abnormal, or to a combined lack of both sensitivity and knowledge. Radiology also requires the acquisition of oculomotor skills through practice and optimization. Radiologic expertise thus changes the oculomotor system in predictable and detectable ways, in much the same way that an athlete’s body and brain change as a function of expertise acquisition in their sport. We will therefore analyze both the consistency between experts’ fixation choices in medical images, and the eye movement performance characteristics of experts vs novice radiologists, to create an objective oculomotor bi- omarker of radiological expertise. The differences between novices and experts will train a deep learning (DL) system, which will have human visual and oculomotor performance characteristics. Training the DL with the abnormalities identified by a panel of expert radiologists will allow it to pinpoint the possible solutions in the manner of a simulated human radiologist performing at peak accuracy, precision, and speed. The resulting rank- ordered list of possible optimal and suboptimal image-reading strategies will serve as a benchmarking tool to quantify the performance of actual clinicians and residents who read the same images, rested vs fatigued. Meas- uring the effects of both training and fatigue on radiology expertise will be a major interdisciplinary cross-cutting advance in performance assessment. Our proposal to quantify fatigue in terms of erosion of expertise represents a transformational advance towards objective fitness-for-duty and expertise measures in medicine and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are 25-32 million perceptual errors in radiological case studies worldwide each year, contributing to med- ical error, the third most common cause of death in the US. We seek to reduce detection errors in radiology with four innovations: (1) we will empirically and objectively determine the visual textures used by expert radiologists to identify abnormalities within medical images; (2) we will determine the ways in which expert radiologists use their eyes, and especially their peripheral vision, to scan images and target informative regions; (3) we will de- velop a perceptual learning paradigm to optimally train residents in both texture perception and oculomotor per- formance domains; and (4) we will construct a deep learning model bestowed with simulated human visual and oculomotor capabilities, to create a normative model of human radiological expertise. The combined results from these studies will quantify peak expert performance and be employed to track and enhance individual expertise acquisition during radiology training; thus, the proposed research will help reduce medical error and moreover provide objective fitness-for-duty measurement tools—based on quantified biomarkers—to evaluate and ame- liorate the effects of fatigue on radiologic performance.",Novel Perceptual and Oculomotor Heuristics for Enhancing Radiologic Performance,10220201,R01CA258021,"['Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'Cancer Detection', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Collection', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Sports', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'heuristics', 'human error', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'lung imaging', 'meetings', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'oculomotor behavior', 'pandemic disease', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'shift work', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development']",NCI,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,646124
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment. Larger patient populations could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing mortality.","Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients",10210371,R01CA252216,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Boston', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Endoscopic Biopsy', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal mucous membrane', 'Esophagus', 'Family suidae', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Stomach', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'advanced disease', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'capsule', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'navigation aid', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,345509
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,10117035,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,709759
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,10150846,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,657862
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging Next-Generation In-Vivo Fetal Neuroimaging The overall objective of this project is to dramatically improve fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to advance research in early human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders, the burden of which is, unfortunately, high because of their life-long impact and high prevalence. Fetal MRI has been the technique of choice in studying prenatal brain development. Fetal motion, however, makes MRI slice acquisition unreliable at best, as the fetus frequently moves while the prescribed slices are imaged. Uncompensated fetal motion disrupts 3D coverage of the anatomy and reduces the spatial resolution of slice-to-volume reconstructions. Repeating the scans does not ensure full 3D coverage of the anatomy, but increases total acquisition time. This, in turn, dramatically reduces the success rate and reliability of fetal MRI in studying the development of transient fetal brain compartments that are selectively sensitive to injury over the course of fetal development. To mitigate these issues and improve fetal MRI, we propose to automatically measure fetal brain position and prospectively navigate slices to each new position in real-time. The impact of this approach will be to dramatically increase the success rate and spatial resolution of fetal MRI for the in-vivo investigation of developing brain compartments, while, in parallel, reducing scan time, effectively making fetal MRI less burdensome for the mother, more accurate, and cost effective. By eliminating the manual re- adjustment of stack-of-slice positions, the time that elapses between scans will be virtually continuous. Our proposed technique will also make fetal MRI less operator-dependent and thus, more reproducible across sites, which is essential to conducting multi-center studies and clinical trials. Prospective navigation of fetal MRI slices to compensate for motion requires the development of novel, real-time image processing algorithms to recognize the fetal brain and its position and orientation; to track fetal motion to steer slices; and to detect and re-acquire motion corrupted slices. In this project, we will develop innovative deep learning models to process fetal MRI slices in real-time; will translate those models into an integrated system to prospectively navigate fetal MRI slices; and will validate the system on fetuses scanned at various gestational ages. To assess the utility and impact of the proposed technology, we will measure subplate volume in fetuses. The four specific aims of this study are to 1) assess fetal MRI via variable density image acquisition and reconstruction; 2) achieve real-time recognition of the fetal brain in MRI slices; 3) develop a system of real-time fetal head motion tracking and steering of slices; and 4) measure the subplate volume in the developing fetal brain using MRI. These aims will collectively translate and validate new imaging and image processing techniques to advance fetal MRI, and effectively eliminate a critical barrier to making progress in the fields of developmental neurology and neuroscience. Project Narrative: The proposed research aims to develop, translate, and validate innovative in-vivo imaging technologies to improve imaging and studying the development of the human fetal brain before birth. The technology will enable and improve studies on the development of the brain in fetuses with congenital disorders or fetuses at risk of having neurodevelopmental issues later in life. This in-turn is expected to result in timely and more effective treatments and therapeutic interventions that will lead to vastly improved patient outcomes in both the short- and long-term, effectively reducing the burden of human disabilities arising from congenital disorders.",Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging,10280126,R01EB031849,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Head', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Live Birth', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uterus', 'absorption', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive disability', 'congenital heart disorder', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'migration', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'virtual']",NIBIB,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,588593
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications. Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for ACR. We demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and ECV predicts adverse clinical events in HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images. For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, ECV), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult, 2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145 HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop multiparametric cardiac MRI and automated deep learning based cardiac MRI analysis workflows for improved assessment for complications after heart transplantation, the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage heart failure. Cardiac MRI will be developed to allow for efficient application from pediatric to adult patients in order to evaluate its diagnostic value for non-invasively detecting complications and to investigate the impact of differences in heart donor and recipient characteristics on the performance of the transplanted heart. In addition, we will leverage an existing large cardiac MRI database to allow for long-term 5-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management in heart transplant recipients.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,10208494,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Angiography', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Donor Selection', 'Donor person', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Label', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Transplanted Heart Complication', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Ventricular', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'graft failure', 'health care service utilization', 'heart allograft', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tissue biomarkers', 'transplant database', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,695340
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10232306,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'high body mass index', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,651069
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents. The developed technology is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care.",Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study,10124390,R01EB028297,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Inferior', 'Joint repair', 'Label', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'age related', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'child depression', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'critical period', 'denoising', 'developmental disease', 'illicit drug use', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurodevelopment', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'potential biomarker', 'quantitative imaging', 'socioeconomics', 'time use', 'tool', 'young adult']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,436591
"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases Abstract Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin- echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack-of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer. Project Narrative Liver metastases are common in colorectal cancer and knowledge of number, location and size impacts precision of therapy, survival and overall costs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for evaluating liver metastases but detection and diagnosis of small tumors remains challenging. Our proposal is based on a collaborative integrated team of university scientists, clinician-scientists and industry engineers to develop and clinically trial new MRI technology that overcomes limitations related to imaging small liver tumors in patients.",Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases,10063981,R01CA245920,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Benign', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Chelating Agents', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resectable', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'colon cancer patients', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'liver imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,536670
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,10093035,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558172
"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10206141,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,89563
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,10155483,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,631942
"Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing ABSTRACT No real-time quantitative devices are clinically used to assess oral lesions during routine examination, making in-clinic diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring challenging. Instead, lesions are evaluated through visual inspection and then histopathological analysis of tissue samples extracted during biopsy. Identifying premalignant and malignant oral lesions early is critical to ensuring effective treatment is provided to patients with malignancies. Oral cancer currently has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates (50% or less) among major cancer types, largely due to the challenges in identifying premalignant and malignant lesions early. Clearly, a real-time in-clinic device able to classify oral lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant has the potential to provide immediate impact to patient care. Significantly different electrical property signatures have been observed between benign and malignant tissues in a variety of organs, including tongue; since the bioelectrical properties are so dependent on tissue architecture and morphology, we hypothesize that sensing and imaging these properties in the context of oral lesions will enable us to accurately characterize and classify morphologically-different benign, premalignant, and malignant oral lesions. We have developed an endoscopic electrical impedance imaging (EII) device for use in intraoperative surgical margin assessment that we aim to optimize for in-clinic oral lesion assessment. We aim to take the significant step of translating our extensive experience in impedance imaging to develop an oral lesion imaging device that can be deployed safely, and in the clinic, to provide real-time feedback regarding oral lesion classification. We propose constructing a novel chip-on-tip EII probe to sense and image at near microscopic resolution oral lesions in an effort to provide clinicians with real-time, accurate classification of oral lesion pathology that can be used for diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring purposes. The probe will be evaluated on a series of in vivo human oral lesions and compared with histopathological analysis of biopsy samples. The low-cost of a device such as this makes it an ideal technology for low-resource settings and the safety and real-time capabilities of the system make it ideal for continuously following lesions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Visual inspection of oral lesions is not sufficient for accurately classifying lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant. The electrical properties of oral lesion have the potential to be used as a contrast mechanism to accurately classify oral lesions so that optimal treatment can be provided to patients with malignant lesions. We intend to deploy a novel small field of view chip-on-tip electrical impedance imaging (EII) probe in a cohort of patients with oral lesions to evaluate the efficacy of using EII for oral lesion classification.",Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing,10287597,R21DE031095,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancerous', 'Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Contralateral', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysplasia', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Hand', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oral Characters', 'Oral cavity', 'Organ', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Squamous Cell', 'Surgical margins', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'analog', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'imaging probe', 'imaging properties', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'oral lesion', 'oral tissue', 'premalignant', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'programs', 'response', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,191061
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,10093121,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread non-traumatic, demyelinating disorder in young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids in both diagnosing MS and assisting clinical management of patients. In addition to focal MS lesions, diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) is also seen on brain MRI in MS patients. While not understood completely, DAWM is thought to be a predictor of disease burden, possibly appears early on in the disease, and may be a marker of neurodegeneration in MS. However, longitudinal studies of DAWM are lacking, and segmentation of DAWM is manual, making it difficult to study the evolution of DAWM. The main objective of this proposal is to longitudinally study the development of DAWM in MS. This objective will be realized by analyzing preexisting longitudinal MRI data acquired on 1008 MS patients who participated in phase 3, blinded, multi-center clinical trial, referred to as CombiRx that was supported by NIH. The CombiRx data includes multi-contrast MRI and various clinical measures. Automatic identification of DAWM is a critical component of this proposal. Based on our preliminary studies, deep Learning (a class of machine learning algorithms) has the potential to automatically identify DAWM and estimate its volume. We will use the large CombiRx MRI data for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning models, and to study DAWM evolution in this MS cohort. The proposal has two major aims. In the first aim we will develop a deep learning model based on fully-convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of DAWM, gray matter, normal appearing white matter, and T2-hyperintense lesions guided by manual segmentation of two neuroimaging experts. In the second aim we will segment DAWM and all brain tissues, including focal lesions, at baseline and all available follow-up scans in the CombiRx cohort (up to 6.5 years). The temporal changes in volume, location, and MRI parameters of DAWM and focal T2 lesions will be computed. We will finally test whether DAWM is precursor to focal T2 lesions, associated with T2 lesion resolution, or a separate disease process altogether. If DAWM is shown to occur early on in the disease, it is possible to intervene sooner for improved outcome. Similarly, if DAWM is shown to be related to disease activity, it can serve as an objective and quantitative measure of the disease. Such an objective measurement would be highly valuable in developing targeted therapies and also in evaluating the treatment effect in MS patients. The main objective of this proposal is to study the evolution of diffusely appearing white matter (DAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using a novel deep learning approach. The results of this study are expected to be highly valuable in evaluating the treatment effect in individual MS patients. These results can also help reduce time and money in conducting clinical trials substantially, which would lead to early introduction of promising drugs into the market. Finally, if DAWM occurs early on in the disease, as suggested by some of the publications, it is possible to therapeutically intervene sooner for improved outcome.",Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach,10217627,R21NS118320,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Demyelinations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protons', 'Publications', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated segmentation', 'axonopathy', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,234000
"Next-Generation Cardiovascular MRI powered by Artificial Intelligence Project Summary/Abstract: Despite the accuracy and versatility of cardiovascular MRI, its footprint is only 1% among cardiac imaging tests (SPECT, echocardiography, CT, MRI) in the US. While there are several factors such as referral patterns favoring SPECT and echocardiography among cardiologists that account for low utilization, the two addressable obstacles that preclude widespread adoption are lengthy scan time (imaging facility operational cost) and reading (physician cost). These obstacles must be addressed for community hospitals with limited resources to adopt cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. While compressed sensing (CS), since its introduction into the MRI world in 2007, has led to highly-accelerated cardiovascular MRI acquisitions, the subsequent image reconstruction remains too slow (> 5 min for 2D time series, > 1 hour for 3D time series) for clinical translation (unmet need 1). Downstream, image analysis for cardiovascular MRI is notoriously labor intensive (e.g. 30- to 60-min) and limited (“circles” at two cardiac phases for cine MRI, whereas perfusion and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) images are evaluated visually), for what is essentially a basic computer vision task (unmet need 2). In direct response, we will address these two unmet needs and unlock the enormous potential of CMR using deep learning (DL). DL applications have exploded since advancements in optimization and GPU hardware. While several recent studies have applied neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-Nets, and Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) for reconstruction and segmentation, no study has implemented an inline end-to-end pipeline that receives raw k-space from the MRI scanner and delivers both reconstructed images and fully processed images automatically with high speed (< 1 min). The objectives of this study are: a) developing a network for image reconstruction with maximal acceleration (aim 1), (b) developing a network for image processing tasks (aim 2), and c) developing an integrated, end-to-end network that does both (aim 3). By developing an architecture that can simultaneously learn maximal acceleration, fine tune end-to-end performance, and perform reconstruction/inference using feed-forward networks, we anticipate a disruptive technology that will lead to a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and increase its footprint in community hospitals. This 2-year study is doable because of the requisite database of raw k-space (not derived from DICOM) data (N = 617) and annotated cardiac MR images (N=3,021) from over 3,000 patients existing at our institution. Success of this proposal will deliver a disruptive technology that has potential to cause a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and enable widespread adoption of cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a new-generation cardiovascular MRI technology empowered by artificial intelligence, more specifically deep learning. The proposed technology accurately reconstructs cardiovascular images and segments cardiac regions of interest within 1 min without any human intervention.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilirubin', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fatty Liver', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Portal Hypertension', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling Errors', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Vendor', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'accurate diagnosis', 'accurate diagnostics', 'chronic liver disease', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic technologies', 'elastography', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'liver biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'non-linear transformation', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sex']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,628266
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",10084899,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,616003
"Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Summary Organ motion is a predominant limiting factor for the maximum exploitation of modern radiation therapy (RT). Adverse influence of the organ motion is aggravated in hypofractionated treatment because of protracted dose delivery. Current image guided RT often relies on the use of implanted fiducial markers (FMs) for online/offline target localization, which is invasive and costly, and introduces possible bleeding, infection and discomfort of the patient. In this project, we harness the enormous potential of deep learning and investigate a novel markerless localization strategy by combined use of a pre-trained deep learning model and kV X-ray projection or cone beam CT images. We hypothesize that incorporation of deep layers of image information allows us to visualize otherwise invisible target in real-time and greatly reduce the uncertainties in beam targeting. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Develop a DL-based tumor target localization framework for image guided RT (IGRT); (2) Apply the DL-based strategy to localize prostate target on 2D kV X-ray projection and 3D CBCT images; and (3) Evaluate the potential clinical impact of the DL strategy for pancreatic IGRT. This study brings up, for the first time, highly accurate markerless target localization based on deep learning and provides a clinically sensible solution for IGRT of prostate and pancreas cancers or other types of cancers. Successful completion of this investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision RT. Given its significant promise to optimally cater for inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the study should lead to substantial improvement in patient care and enables us to utilize maximally the technical capability of modern RT such as IMRT and VMAT. Given the dose responsive nature of various cancers and that the proposed method requires no hardware modification, this research should lead to a widespread impact on the management of neoplasmic diseases affected by organ motion. Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Narrative This project is aimed at establishing a deep learning-based image guidance strategy for motion management in prostate and pancreas radiation therapy.

"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10234187,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,735785
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer. Project Narrative Although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Successful development of the proposed deep-learning artificial intelligence scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in detecting colorectal polyps from non-cathartic CTC examinations that addresses the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.",Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography,10054168,R01CA212382,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Air', 'American Cancer Society', 'American College of Radiology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catharsis', 'Cathartics', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Assisted', 'Contrast Media', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Oral Ingestion', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'computer aided detection', 'computer center', 'deep learning', 'detection sensitivity', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'prevent', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'soft tissue', 'spectrograph', 'virtual']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,120631
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,10144432,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,209375
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'risk prediction']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863
"Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an increasing role in guidance of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the abdo- men, with special emphasis in embolization procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for control of internal hemorrhage. However, relatively long scan time of CBCT results in artifacts arising from organ motion (respiratory and cardiac motion and peristalsis). This poses a significant challenge to guidance in interventional radiology: for example, motion artifacts were found to render up to 25% of CBCT images un-interpretable in image-guided TACE, and 18% in CBCT-guided emergency TAE. The impact of motion is most significant in cases of single or isolated lesions treated with selective embolization that requires visual- ization of very small vascular structures. Existing motion correction methods often invoke assumption of periodicity, lim- iting their applicability outside of cardiac and respiratory motions, or rely on fiducial tracking or gated acquisition that disrupt IR workflow and/or increase radiation dose. Therefore, the application of CBCT in image-guided interventional procedures in the abdomen would significantly benefit from new methods that estimate complex deformable motion directly from image data. “Autofocus” techniques based on maximization of a regularized image sharpness criterion were shown to yield effective patient motion compensation in extremity, head and cardiac CBCT. However, current applications of such methods are limited to rigid motions. We hypothesize that deformable organ motion compensation in interven- tional soft-tissue CBCT can be achieved with advanced autofocus techniques using multiple locally rigid regions of in- terest, preconditioned with basic motion characteristics obtained through a machine learning decision framework. The following aims will be pursued: 1) Develop a joint multi-region autofocus optimization method to compensate deforma- ble organ motion. This includes incorporation into a comprehensive artifacts correction and image reconstruction pipe- line, design of multi-stage optimization schedules for convergence acceleration, and performance evaluation in deforma- ble phantoms, and cadaver and animal experiments. 2) Develop a decision framework for preconditioning of the motion compensation method through a combination of projection-based approaches for physiological signal estimations (res- piratory cycle) and a multi-input, multi-branch, deep learning architecture trained on extremely realistic simulated data that will estimate basic properties of motion (spatial distribution of amplitude, direction, and frequency) from an initial motion-contaminated image and its associated raw projection data. 3) Evaluate deformable motion compensation in animal experiments and in a clinical study in 50 cases of CBCT-guided TACE and assess image quality via expert observer evaluation of satisfaction and utility. The proposed work will yield a robust, practical method for compensation of deform- able soft-tissue motion in CBCT, removing a critical impediment to 3D guidance in IR. The deformable autofocus frame- work will be applicable to other interventions in which soft-tissue motion diminishes CBCT guidance, such as image-guided radiation therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT) provides critical 3D information to guide minimally-invasive procedures in the abdomen, but CBCT image quality is often compromised by organ deformation due to breathing, cardiac, and peristaltic motions. We propose a novel framework to mitigate the effects of this complex deformable motion using only the CBCT image data, without a need for gating, external trackers, or fiducial markers. This algorithm will remove a major impediment to 3D guidance in procedures such as transcatheter embolization procedures in the abdomen.",Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology,10100337,R01EB030547,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Arterial Embolization', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Emergency Situation', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Peristalsis', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'heart motion', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'internal control', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'preconditioning', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'tumor']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,368438
"Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning Project Summary  Clinical and research applications of the PET imaging are rapidly expanding from ever improving diagnostic and treatment assessment applications to guidance of personalized treatments, ultra-low dose imaging, and even interventional imaging procedures. Supporting these developments, reconstruction tools that are able to reliably handle both typical and (ultra-)low count situations, imperfect data, and data from specialized imaging geometries, with fast (near real-time) reconstruction performance are of crucial importance. The overall goal of this project is to develop and investigate robust and efficacious Deep Learning (DL) reconstruction approaches addressing these needs. A unique and innovative feature of the proposed approaches (compared to alternative DL applications) is the utilization of list-mode data histogrammed into a very efficient histo-image format. TOF data partitioned into the histo-image format are characterized by strong local properties, thus perfectly fitting convolutional neural network formalism and making DL training and reconstruction directly from realistic clinical data (in size and character) highly feasible and practical.  The clinical utility of PET systems has significantly improved over the years thanks to advances in instrumentation, data corrections, and reconstruction approaches. Nevertheless, full utilization of their potential through robust and fast quantitative reconstruction remains a challenge especially for the cases of very low count data, such as in low-count temporal (motion and dynamic) frames, delayed studies, longitudinal low-dose studies, and studies using new isotopes with long half-life and low positron fraction rates (e.g. in 89Zr-labeled CAR-T cell imaging), as well as in specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage, for which exact, artifact-free, reconstruction does not exist. These are the situations for which the developed DL approaches promise great potential due to the demonstrated success of the DL networks to be trained for imperfect and very low count data without reliance on accurate data models. Furthermore, pre-trained networks can provide ultra- fast, near real-time, performance in practical use.  Specific Aim 1 will develop tools for DL PET reconstruction using histo-image partitioning along with procedures for training of the proposed DL approaches, including novel approaches advancing the state-of-the- art of DL reconstruction directly from acquired PET data. Specific Aim 2 is directed towards study and evaluation of the performance of the investigated DL approaches for whole-body and long axial FOV scanner data for the wide range of counts from applications such as typical FDG, low dose, delayed, low activity isotope scans, and ultra-short frames in motion correction and dynamic studies. Specific Aim 3 will develop and apply motion correction protocols involving the proposed DL reconstruction tools and test and study their efficacy for clinically realistic situations involving non-rigid lung and heart motions. And finally, Specific Aim 4 is dedicated to an application and study of the developed DL approaches to specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage. 1 Project Narrative  The major goal of this project is to improve the diagnostic, treatment guidance, and research utility of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, through the development of robust, near real-time, deep-learning based reconstruction approaches allowing efficacious use of standard, low dose, and novel low activity imaging molecular bio-tracers. The proposed work is relevant to public health, since an improvement in the reconstructed images will lead to more accurate diagnosis of diseases and more accurate treatment guidance and monitoring of the response to therapy, while allowing for decreased patient radiation dose. It will also facilitate quantitatively reliable tools for research investigations with new radiotracers for PET tailored to specific diseases. 2",Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning,10276952,R01EB031806,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Application procedure', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Breast', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cellular imaging', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'efficacy evaluation', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning network', 'loss of function', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'proton therapy', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'solid state', 'statistics', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,620138
"Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Although current MRI performs well as a tool to measure white matter (WM) inflammation in MS, its ability to quantify gray matter (GM) pathology, meningeal inflammation, and chronic inflammatory changes are limited. For this reason, researchers have looked to 7-tesla (7T) MRI for more robust in vivo measures of pathology. Although the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI for these aspects of MS have stimulated much interest, the impact of previous studies have been limited due to small sample sizes, varying methodologies, cumbersome analysis methods, and conflicting results – all of which have limited the generalizability of findings and more widespread dissemination of the use of this tool. Objective: In this study, we aim to advance the use of 7T MRI as a tool for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effect monitoring by performing multi-site, large sample size evaluation of imaging correlates of cortical and deep GM lesions, chronic active WM lesions (WM lesions with paramagnetic rims on MRI), and meningeal inflammation (leptomeningeal inflammation (LME) on MRI) and validation of their clinical relevance. We also will look develop automated tools for identification and quantification of these findings on 7T MRI. Study Design: Imaging and clinical data will be derived from previous and ongoing studies of the use of 7T MRI in MS performed at multiple collaborative sites under the umbrella of the North American Imaging in MS (NAIMS) Collaborative, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Harvard-Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. This includes data on up to 814 individual persons with MS, 1232 individual study visits, and a follow up period of up to 5 years. GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME will be identified on 7T, with critical evaluation of methods and their relationship to clinical data. Further, the manual analysis results will be used as training sets for deep learning algorithms for identification of these abnormalities on future 7T MRI scans. Impact: This study would provide the data on measurement variability and generalizable clinical importance of the imaging findings being investigated, along with providing automated tools for future, high-throughput studies. In advancing these precise measures of aspects of MS pathology only poorly measured on lower field MRI, this study will lead to more accurate MS diagnoses, improvements in the ability to monitor changes in MS pathology over time, and perhaps lead to the screening of new pharmaceutical interventions to target GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME. Project Narrative In this study, multiple institutions performing research using 7-tesla (7T) MRI research on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will combine data for a large scale, pooled analysis project. The investigators will refine methods for visualizing cortical and deep gray matter lesions, chronically inflamed white matter lesions, and meningeal inflammation on 7T MRI in MS and will evaluate their clinical relevance on a large scale and develop machine learning algorithms for future identification. It is expected that validating findings on 7T and their clinical relevance along with providing automated tools for analysis will lead to the use of 7T MRI as a more widespread clinical tool, resulting in earlier diagnoses, better prognostication, and more effective treatment monitoring in MS.",Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI,10278178,R01NS122980,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Baltimore', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maryland', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meningeal', 'Meninges', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'comparative', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'outcome forecast', 'physically handicapped', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,535821
"Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative tracer images from combined PET-CT and PET-MR are increasingly being utilized for radiological decision-making and clinical trials. CT and MR based data corrections for PET photon attenuation, typically the largest impact on tracer quantification, can lead to increased radiation dose to the subject or require lengthy additional dedicated MR scans, respectively. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the PET signal originating from the subject alone to estimate attenuation have shown promising early results, but, can have reduced performance when applied to exams different from the training data. Reconstruction methods that jointly estimate both the measured attenuation and tracer contrast from the subject PET signal represent a viable alternative, but, to date, have failed to match the quantification of CT approaches. Consequently, no single approach for PET attenuation correction that consistently produces high quantification and does not compromise patient safety or throughput currently exists. This is an important problem, since research and clinical findings must balance these practical issues with data quality. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a high performance attenuation correction scheme that utilizes both the PET signal from the subject and a variable activity external source. The central hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction method will have significantly improved performance over reconstruction algorithms using PET signal originating from the subject alone, independent of the imaging study. The two specific aims include: 1) developing and validating a supplemental transmission-based algorithm for correcting PET images for photon attenuation during commercial PET imaging and 2) prototyping and characterizing a device capable of dynamically varying external source activity. The result of Aim 1 will be a reconstruction algorithm that is optimized to produce quantitative PET data for some of the most common clinical PET studies. Under Aim 2, a prototype device that can repeatability vary the external source activity in order to maximize tracer quantification while minimizing the unavoidable degradation to patient tracer image noise, caused by the introduction of any external source, will be produced. The innovation is an attenuation correction strategy that greatly mitigates the limitations of previous joint reconstruction methods to deliver quantitative PET diagnostics that are expected to match those of silver standard CT approaches. This is significant because the number of patients receiving brain and cardiac PET-CT scans, exams the proposed method is expected to benefit, is steadily increasing. For PET-MR, the method may improve tracer quantification where MR has limited performance and increase patient throughput by eliminating the need for non-diagnostic attenuation-only MR acquisitions. Thus, the proposed strategy has great potential to significantly improve radiological decision- making and clinical trial findings that rely on quantitative PET uptake measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because the development of a PET radiotracer attenuation correction strategy that is independent of the exam type, has the potential to improve the strength of research and clinical findings based on quantitative PET measurements. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIBIB's mission that pertains to enhancing existing imaging and bioengineering modalities.",Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging,10222671,R03EB028946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radioactive', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Tube', 'attenuation', 'base', 'data quality', 'experimental study', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'patient safety', 'pediatric patients', 'prototype', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2021,86474
"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,10168531,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,724046
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies. This will be achieved by using fast, automated scan prescription of standard anatomical planes and by adaptively updating the acquisition as motion happens in the scanner, based on sub-second navigator scans interleaved with the imaging sequence.",Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI,10197182,K99HD101553,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'echo detection', 'experience', 'fetal', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,109671
"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health across different tissues in osteoarthritis.",Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI,10190939,R01EB002524,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GAG Gene', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Proteoglycan', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'clinical application', 'clinical examination', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy trial', 'imaging approach', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mechanical properties', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,611185
