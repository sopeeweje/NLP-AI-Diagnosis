"The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes. SUMMARY In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation leading to Î²-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6- methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research. Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022- 23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control (glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies. NARRATIVE Increasing evidence supports the role of arsenic exposure in diabetes development. We will evaluate novel epitranscriptomic mechanisms linking arsenic to diabetes and metabolic dysfunction in American Indian communities. This study can provide insight into novel pathways of arsenic related diabetes, identify prevention interventions, and inform recommendations for arsenic levels in water and food.",The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes.,10140691,R01ES032638,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'American Indians', 'Arizona', 'Arsenic', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Stress Response', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disputes', 'Elderly man', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Heart', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oklahoma', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Stability', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'South Dakota', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Whole Blood', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptome', 'epitranscriptomics', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,684582
"The Ohio State University Chronic Pancreatitis Diabetes Pancreas Cancer (CPDPC) Clinical Center ABSTRACT The mechanistic underpinnings of diseases involving the exocrine pancreas are poorly understood. Chronic pancreatitis is often accompanied by inflammation of the pancreas, irreversible fibrosis, and destruction of the pancreatic parenchyma resulting in abdominal pain, malnutrition, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatogenic diabetes, and, in some cases, pancreas cancer. We have developed a network of adult and pediatric investigators to form The Ohio State University Clinical Center (OSU CC). In a multidisciplinary collaboration with other clinical centers in the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Centers (CPDPC-CCs) (U01), the OSU CC has helped develop four (4) major observational studies during the initial funding cycle to address research gaps in our understanding of diseases of the exocrine pancreas. Specifically, the OSU CC seeks to validate proposed diagnostic biomarkers in chronic pancreatitis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and pancreas cancer.

"Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy PROJECT SUMMARY: Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy Vision loss from diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged adults in the United States (US). Advanced diabetic retinopathy is referred to as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). In many patients, blindness associated with PDR can be prevented with appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, some patients at high risk for PDR are not receiving adequate eye care. More knowledge is needed about PDR outcomes in a real-world setting, and the differences between published study outcomes and real-world effectiveness. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in nearly 90% of outpatient physician offices and can be a powerful tool for studying PDR in a real-world setting. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate EHR-based methods to improve outcomes in PDR. The study aims are: (1) to classify patients with PDR in the EHR system using an automated method that incorporates structured (e.g., diagnosis code, medications, labs) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes), (2) to predict the progression of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy to PDR using a forecasting model with time-varying covariates, and (3) to determine the real-world effectiveness of treatments for PDR in a large nationwide eye dataset. The study will utilize data from the University of California San Franciscoâs (UCSF) De-Identified Clinical Data Warehouse, a de-identified EHR with over 1 million patients that has available eye exam information, and the Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry, a nationwide comprehensive eye database that includes data from over 15,000 eye providers in the US with over 1 million patients with PDR. The innovative methods and tools from this study can be applied to other eye conditions to facilitate future EHR- based clinical studies in ophthalmology. The candidate, Dr. Catherine Sun is an ophthalmologist whose long- term goal is to study real-world clinical outcomes in ophthalmology by conducting EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials and using large-scale EHR data. While she possesses the foundational skills, additional mentored training and coursework in data analytics, biomedical informatics, biostatistics, and advanced clinical trial design and implementation will help her reach her goals. Her outstanding mentorship team of primary mentor Dr. Nisha Acharya and co-mentors Dr. Travis Porco and Dr. Joshua Stein, and the exceptional environment of the Department of Ophthalmology and the F.I. Proctor Foundation at UCSF will support Dr. Sunâs development into an R01-funded independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) represents advanced diabetic eye disease and can result in permanent vision loss. The electronic health record (EHR) can be a powerful tool for studying real-world outcomes of conditions like PDR to help prevent disease occurrence and improve outcomes. We will develop and validate EHR-based methods and tools to improve outcomes in PDR, which can also be applied to other eye conditions to facilitate future EHR-based clinical studies in ophthalmology.",Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy,10191673,K23EY032637,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'comparison intervention', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'risk stratification', 'routine care', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'unstructured data']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,252236
"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,10147069,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,561582
"12/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (âdysglycemiaâ) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c â¥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"6/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (âdysglycemiaâ) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c â¥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection.

There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c â¥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort.

"3/22 DPPOS Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) â Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (âdysglycemiaâ) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c â¥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection.

"Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes Abstract Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a variety of vascular complications of the disease, but clinical trials of medication regimens designed to achieve near-normal HbA1c have been disappointing and may even increase the risk of adverse outcomes due to polypharmacy. Enhancing behavioral management of postprandial glycemia can further reduce glycemic exposure and downstream effects without the risks of polypharmacy. Postprandial glycemia is largely driven by dietary intake, but research findings regarding the best dietary approach to limit glycemic exposure are mixed and mostly negative. Studies done, to-date, have used one-size-fits-all dietary regimens that do not take into consideration the fact that glycemic response is highly individual. In this clinical trial of 255 (85/group) individuals with early-stage T2D, participants will be randomized to: (1) a Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral lifestyle intervention that includes a one-size-fits-all Mediterranean ADA diet (hereafter Standardized), (2) Standardized plus personalized dietary guidance to minimize postprandial glycemic response to meals (hereafter Personalized), or (3) a Usual Care Control plus (hereafter UCC). We will compare the groups in terms of mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE). Hypothesis MAGEPersonalized< MAGEStandardized < MAGEUCC at 6 months. At each time point we will describe between group differences in HbA1c, Î²-cell function, and the need to escalate the medication regimen. We also will describe the impact of the interventions on alternative measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation, Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action, area under the curve, and frequency of out-of-range and seriously out- of-range glucose values). We will explore the relative contribution of GV and HbA1c to observed changes in Î²- cell function. The proposed study is an integrative scientific undertaking, reflecting the input of experts in nursing, the behavioral sciences, computational biology, microbiome, mHealth technology, endocrinology, and nutrition for the development of personalized behavioral counseling to minimize glycemic exposure and disease progression in those with early-stage T2D. Project Narrative Limiting blood sugar peaks following meals is an important treatment goal in the management of type 2 diabetes, but evidence is mixed regarding the best dietary approach to achieve this goal. One-size-fits-all dietary recommendations may fail to limit blood sugar peaks because individuals differ greatly in their blood sugar responses to the very same foods. In this study we will compare two Mediterranean-type diabetic diets, one that has been standardized and one that has been personalized using a gut microbiome-based algorithm to limit blood sugar peaks following meals.",Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes,10119622,R01NR018916,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Beta Cell', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Counseling', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diabetic Diet', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education', 'Endocrinology', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polypharmacy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'design', 'dietary', 'dietary approach', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'microbiome', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social cognitive theory', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NINR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,743162
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRIâs in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged â¥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Associationâs consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that âThere are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.â Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375
"UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow up Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) represent landmark achievements in diabetes research. The DCCT enrolled 1441 men and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a randomized trial of intensive vs. conventional insulin therapy, delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications and dramatically changing the management of patients worldwide. Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D. The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications. Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort. However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems, particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI, and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE To advance our understanding of bladder dysfunction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), this project links existing information on diabetes severity from a large NIH study to new assessments of urinary symptoms and bladder dysfunction and urine specimens for gene expression analyses. This work will contribute comprehensive critical data to expand our knowledge about the natural history and molecular mechanisms of bladder dysfunction in T1D.",UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes,10205344,R01DK116723,"['Achievement', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Amputation', 'Ancillary Study', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Blindness', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Urothelium', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autonomic neuropathy', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes control', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'incontinence symptom', 'insight', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mechanotransduction', 'member', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,722963
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the âDFU100â cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as âbystandersâ (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound âbystandersâ, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,10159971,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired healing', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Infection', 'Wound models', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic ulcer', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'tissue-repair responses', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,516181
"Deep Learning Based Genetic Risk Prediction for Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of childhood caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a subset of individuals with a genetic predisposition to T1D, environmental triggers instigate an autoimmune response which targets and damages pancreatic islets, leading to pre-diabetes and ultimately diabetes. A critical barrier in T1D prevention research is to identify and directly enroll children with a strong genetic predisposition for developing T1D into prevention trials. A robust genetic risk score (GRS) would allow for the identification of children at high-risk of T1D, their recruitment into T1D prevention trials, and subsequent testing of novel interventions. I aim to 1) optimize a multi-layer feedforward neural network genetic risk predictor that can be used to enroll newborns directly into T1D prevention trials; and 2) identify putative, novel T1D-causing SNPs, and their interactions. Completion of aim 1 would provide a better GRS to the T1D research community, which can be used to identify children with higher genetic risk of T1D development, increasing the statistical power of future T1D prevention clinical trials. Completion of aim 2 will provide a deeper biological understanding of the molecular drivers of T1D development, and potential new therapeutic targets for T1D prevention trials. Successful completion of this project will both help understand the genetic causes of type 1 diabetes and help prevent the disease.

"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,10245208,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,562886
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (âdDPPâ arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10259878,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical outcome measures', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'digital health', 'digital intervention', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,714718
"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the âGreater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,â which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10252045,U01DK108314,"['Adult', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cancer Detection', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'County', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzymes', 'Exocrine pancreas', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'imaging modality', 'liquid biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organizational structure', 'participant retention', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'recruit', 'response', 'study population', 'treatment trial', 'working group']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,176996
"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome â incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement). These advances offer long-term potential for the development of new therapies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes.",Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease,10153779,R01DK123459,"['Address', 'Biological Markers', 'CCL2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Renal function', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'United States', 'aptamer', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'complement pathway', 'complement system', 'diabetic', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'nephrogenesis', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'stem', 'study population', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'urinary']",NIDDK,JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER,R01,2021,478789
