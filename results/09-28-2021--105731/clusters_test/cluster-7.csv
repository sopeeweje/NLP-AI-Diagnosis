"Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) such as schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and bipolar disorders (BD) are remarkably common, with SZ alone affecting nearly three million Americans. Despite more than fifty years of research, no cures exist for these conditions and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicate that, in addition to highly penetrant rare mutations, NPD risk also reflects the impact of hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms with small effect sizes. A major challenge in the field has been illuminating the pathways connecting these genetic variants (the vast majority of which fall in non-coding sequences) to target genes and causal cellular phenotypes. To understand how these myriad risk loci causally contribute to disease risk, it is essential to screen for putatively causal variant(s) and determine how they influence gene expression, which has been shown to be cell-type specific, as well as cellular function. Recent evidence has emerged indicating a substantial contribution of RNA splicing variation to heritability across many complex genetic diseases, including SZ. Based on our preliminary analyses and the work of others, we hypothesize that a substantial proportion of NPD GWAS loci exert their pathogenic effects on neuronal function by impacting RNA: its structure, modifications, protein interactions and splicing. To test this, we will apply novel tools and machine learning methods to predict and quantify RNA splicing in the largest SZ, ASD and BD GWAS, in order to predict splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs, Aim 1). To confirm true effects on exon inclusion independently in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (i.e., the major cell-types impacted in NPD), up to several thousand of the predicted splice variants will be tested by a massively parallel reporter assay, MaPSy (Aim 2). Finally, in order to evaluate the cell-type-specific impact of putative causal sQTLs identified in Aims 1 and 2 on neuronal maturation and synaptic function, we will use CRISPR gene editing to engineer these mutations within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of both neural cell types (Aim 3). Our overarching goal is to map and functionally evaluate the NPD-GWAS loci that impact alternative splicing and neuronal function. Our work may impact the field by delivering new insights into the role of common variants in NPD pathophysiology, which could inform ways of improving diagnostics, predicting clinical trajectories, and developing novel therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The causal role of neuropsychiatric disease risk variants putatively involved in RNA splicing on neuronal function has not been fully explored. By combining genetic fine-mapping, machine learning methods, massively parallel reporter assays, CRISPR-genetic engineering, and human induced pluripotent stem cell models, we propose to discover neuropsychiatric risk alleles predicted to impact alternative splicing and empirically test their molecular and functional impact in neurons. By better understanding the role of common variants in disease risk, we hope to improve diagnostics, predict clinical trajectories and develop novel therapeutic interventions.",Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation,10415485,R56MH127844,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'FURIN gene', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Introns', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spliced Genes', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome prediction', 'overexpression', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'standard care', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell model', 'synaptic function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R56,2021,772112
"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA.

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,10129203,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,336445
"Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening We propose to evaluate whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) as an approach for population screening of early-onset treatable recessively inherited conditions. Our analysis will be based on prior and additional work on the large, ancestrally diverse cohort of children constituting all 1,334 cases of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry screening in California over an 8.5 year period.  Our prior analysis found that WES lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity to replace current newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A screening-optimized DNA variant interpretation pipeline identified two known or likely pathogenic variants in most, but not all, affected cases. The pipeline was 88% sensitive and 98.4% specific, numbers too low to replace MS/MS. We found that 1/3 of known or likely pathogenic variants were novel, of which roughly 2/3 were missense. Adequate sensitivity and specificity therefore require accurate annotation of missense variants.  DNA variant annotation has focused on individual variants and is most applicable for dominant disorders for which pathogenicity is determined by a single variant. For recessive diseases, expression is determined by two variants on different chromosomes. We propose a new framework for disease prediction in recessive conditions, in which the bi-allelic variants, or diplotype, is used to assess pathogenicity. We will improve disease detection for autosomal recessive diseases through screening utilizing DNA sequencing by 1) improving interpretation of bi-allelic missense variants by using variant co-evolution, conservation, amino acid proximity and other features to derive a risk score, 2) considering both variants in recessive pathogenicity prediction, and 3) using the California newborn screening data set as a training set with a small number of positives for each disorder and a large number of controls (those cases positive for a different disease) to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict likelihood of disease. To address sensitivity, for 103 exome negative IEM cases from our data set we will fully interrogate the exome data, both for known IEM genes and also the entire exome to identify novel genes. Finally, for those remaining unsolved, we will perform WGS to identify additional causal variants. In so doing, we will also compare WES and WGS in terms of overall sensitivity and specificity for screening.  We anticipate that the proposed study will be a significant advance in assessing DNA sequencing as a newborn screening tool for those early-onset treatable diseases for which there is currently no screening test, leading to decreased death and disability. We propose to improve DNA sequencing as a newborn screening test by increasing the sensitivity and specificity to an acceptable level for those early-onset treatable disorders for which there is no alternative screening test. Given the large number of early-onset treatable conditions for which there is no test, or for which current testing continues to miss cases, DNA sequencing has the potential to have a large public health impact. Current newborn screening for multiple inborn errors of metabolism by tandem mass spectrometry is able to detect 40-50 disorders and is considered to be among the ten greatest public health successes of the first decade of the 21st century by the Centers for Disease Control; DNA based newborn screening could greatly increase the number of disorders identified and lead to timely and disease-specific interventions, thereby further decreasing death and disability due to treatable, early-onset recessive disorders.",Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening,10228509,R21HG011805,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'California', 'Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia)', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Homocystinuria', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Public Health', 'Recessive Genes', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urea cycle disorders', 'Variant', 'Vitamin B6', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'disability', 'early onset', 'early screening', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'success', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,323000
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,10058828,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical trial implementation', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic testing', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,508845
"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,10136082,R01HL152066,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2021,428767
"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10261436,P30AG038070,"['Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biology of Aging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'age related', 'aged', 'animal tissue', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'candidate validation', 'career development', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data tools', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'senescence', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2021,1069526
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computer science', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease,10100560,R01AG070209,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol Homeostasis', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'GRP gene', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heat-Shock Proteins 70', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Action', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Niemann-Pick Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Ubiquitin', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'biochemical tools', 'biophysical tools', 'cell type', 'cholesterol control', 'druggable target', 'early onset', 'fitness', 'genomic variation', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'polypeptide', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein misfolding', 'proteostasis', 'rare genetic disorder', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,443750
"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity. The objective of this F31 fellowship application is to identify and characterize vitamin D binding sites that are associated with susceptibility to MS and disease severity.",Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity,10145491,F31NS113537,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'California', 'ChIP-seq', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study Subject', 'Sun Exposure', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vitamin D3 Receptor', 'Work', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'multiple datasets', 'nervous system disorder', 'pediatric multiple sclerosis', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'receptor binding', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,42076
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",10177978,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2021,744955
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082
"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,10256016,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2021,1051733
"Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes PROJECT SUMMARY Mutations in α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan cause sarcoglyanopathies, a subset of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with devastating effects for patients including muscle wasting, progressive weakness, degeneration of skeletal muscle and often premature death. Accurately diagnosing patients with LGMD before symptom onset or early in the course of the disease has the potential to enable the use of preventative gene therapy or other therapeutics and in the majority of cases can only be done in presymptomatic cases through genetic testing. When a new DNA variant in one of these genes is observed in a patient, however, there is often insufficient evidence to classify it as pathogenic. Within this study, we will use a new approach to express and characterize every possible missense variant in the SGCA, SGCB, SGCG and SGCD genes to advance our understanding of sarcoglycan biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the SGC genes, and advance LGMD care and treatments. We will employ deep mutational scanning, a method for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. We will express a library of all possible SGC missense variants in cultured human cells and measure the effect of each by exploiting a simple but robust characteristic of pathogenic SGC gene variants, disruption of proper protein trafficking. Our two aims are: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible SGC missense variant on SGC protein trafficking and membrane localization, and 2) Predict and validate the pathogenicity of every possible SGC missense variant by integrating multiple functional assays from Aim 1 to create a pathogenicity score for each variant and by confirming variant predictions biochemically using tissue samples from LGMD patients with VUS. These aims will reveal how each possible missense variant in SGC genes impact expression, transport, function or interaction with other SGC proteins. The functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of SGC variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand sarcoglycan biology, improve the clinical translation of sarcoglycanopathies and LGMD using genetic information, and inform new treatments. The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in a subset of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the sarcoglycan genes SGCA, SGCB, SGCD and SGCG. We propose to use an integrated experimental and computational approach that combines multiple high-throughput assays of protein trafficking and function and machine-learning to generate pathogenicity predictions for all possible single- nucleotide variants in these SGC genes and then to validate our predictions in primary tissue samples from patients with SGC variants.",Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes,10193457,R21AR078942,"['Archives', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'International', 'Libraries', 'Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sarcoglycans', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Soluble Guanylate Cyclase', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical referral center', 'clinical translation', 'delta Sarcoglycan', 'gamma Sarcoglycan', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mutation screening', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'premature', 'protein function', 'protein transport', 'tool', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,207900
"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,10134401,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,483750
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.",Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms,10142244,F30HD098803,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computers', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Introns', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'analysis pipeline', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2021,51036
"Genetics of oxycodone intake in a hybrid rat diversity panel. The steady rise in prescription opioids such as oxycodone has led to widespread abuse and deaths in the US. importance of drug pharmacokinetics in determining abuse potential, we have designed an oral operant rat self-administration (SA) procedure to model the pattern of drug intake of most human users/abusers of oxycodone, who initiate using oral tablets. Although genetic variants play important roles in susceptibility to opioid addiction, very limited data are available regarding specific genes and sequence variants that predispose to opioid addiction, and under what conditions. Given the We propose to use an innovative hybrid rat diversity panel (HRDP), which consists of 91 diverse rat genomes, to identify genetic variants influencing operant oxycodone intake in rats. The HRDP is unique in that it: 1) contains a high level of genetic diversity similar to that of human populations; 2) provides a way to control oxycodone exposure and to systematically study gene-by-environment and gene-by-drug interactions; and 3) integrates multi-omics ""addictome"" data: from genetics to epigenomics to brain connectomes to treatments. We have three aims: Aim 1: We will analyze whole genome sequencing data to define virtually all sequence variants that underlie heritable variations. De novo assemblies will be conducted using linked-reads data for selected high impact strains. Hi-C data (Dovetail Genomics) will be generated to further improve the quality of these assemblies. We will also generate RNA-seq data for key brain regions to obtain mechanistic insights into oxycodone intake. Aim 2: Using the HRDP (both sexes), we will phenotype oral oxycodone SA with a unique behavioral model. Rats will also be tested for sensitivity to pain, social behaviors, and anxiety-like traits - all signs of oxycodone withdrawal. Critically, we estimated the heritability (h2) of oxycodone intake in the range of 0.3 – 0.4. When using n=6/sex, the effective h2 is ~0.8 —sufficient for high precision mapping. Aim 3: We will use systems genetics methods to map and integrate behavioral phenotypes with sequence and transcriptome data. Both forward (QTL) and reverse (PheWAS) genetic methods will be used. We use new linear mixed models to map and test candidate genes with key cofactors using the GeneNetwork2 platform. Finally, we evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by comparison to GWAS cohorts and longitudinal reports of addiction in humans. Technical and conceptual advances that underlie this application are: new genomic methods combined with highly diverse rat populations allow us to quickly define novel gene variants that modulate key phases of opiate addiction. It is highly likely that a subset of variants and molecular networks we define will provide key components of a predictive framework linking sequence differences to human opioid addiction and potential treatments. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake. The U.S. has declared a national public health emergency to combat the current opioid crisis that is causing over 30,000 deaths per year. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake.

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,10179320,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612601
"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine. Here we introduce a new generation of pathway-specific polygenic risk scores, informed by biological function, and deliver a comprehensive computational tool for their analysis, applying it to perform patient stratification in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.","Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores",10136725,R01MH122866,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,635256
"Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and 4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’. Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1- kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on ~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Mutations in a specific gene (Apolipoprotein L1 or APOL1) seen only in people of African ancestry (African Americans or Hispanic Americans) is linked to high rates of kidney disease, with only some of the individuals with these mutations developing kidney disease, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors are involved. We will explore these factors including other genes and common environmental exposures like air pollution/neighborhood environment, and heavy metal exposure. We will understand what additional risk factors contribute to kidney disease in individuals with this mutation, which will lead to preventative efforts to address the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease.",Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes,10100412,R01DK127139,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadmium', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome 22', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early treatment', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metabolic', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Urine', 'Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority communities', 'multidisciplinary', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'podocyte', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'socioeconomics', 'targeted treatment', 'urinary', 'walkability']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,775497
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,R01MH125236,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,10160842,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine self-administration', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2021,3009655
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,10213030,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,530499
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,10359459,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2021,135331
"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics.

"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases. In this proposal, we will develop novel deep learning approaches to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development and apply the methods to orofacial cleft genetic data.",Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development,10235696,R01DE030122,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'FaceBase', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'cleft lip and palate', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'craniofacial tissue', 'data integration', 'de novo mutation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic tools', 'heterogenous data', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,585184
"Deep-learning based profiling of patient-derived cells as a tool for genomic and translational medicine Project Summary/Abstract: The genetic landscape of rare and common diseases has emerged as heterogeneous and complex. Already, researchers and clinicians face the challenge to discern pathophysiological mechanism and treatment opportunities for hundreds of genetic subtypes that have been identified in rare diseases, such as inherited neuropathies (INs) or mitochondrial diseases (MiDs) alone. Still, a large fraction of disease loci remains to be discovered – a daunting task, since gene-identification studies often require immense sample-sizes, which are difficult to achieve, even for more common conditions. Simultaneously, much of the heritability of many disorders appears to be determined by the collective impact of possibly thousands of low-impact variants, spread across the genome. Ideally, the impact of a given set of candidate variants could be assessed within high-throughput framework that accounts for the genetic context of individual patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms, we have developed an unbiased, scalable method to rapidly identify disease- associated phenotypes in high-resolution, multiplexed, fluorescent microscopy images of primary, patient derived cells. In turn, the discovered phenotypes can be exploited as experimental signals against which the disease relevance of candidate variants can be confirmed, by virtue of genetic complementation experiments. At the same time, the standardized and scalable nature of our method renders it suitable to test potential therapeutic interventions, e.g. to test the efficacy of potential gene-therapy, or to screen small molecule libraries, while maintaining patient-specific granularity. The goal of this proposal is to apply our approach to an expanded cohort of patient cells and to refine methods to interpret both genetic and pharmacological perturbations. In this, I will be supported by an exceptional and multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical, molecular and functional genetics, and computer scientists, within the world-class scientific environment offered by Columbia University and the Broad Institute. In a carefully designed development plan, I will finalize my training in machine learning and data science, expand my expertise to single-cell RNA-sequencing and other single-cell methods, and acquire essential leadership and scholarly skills required for an independent research career. Over the course of this award, I will apply our cellular profiling approach to generate a standardized map of deep, quantitative descriptions of disease-associated cellular phenotypes across a number of INs, MiDs and neurodegenerative conditions. We will explore the integration of RNA-sequencing to enhance our approach. Finally, we will apply our method to the discovery and confirmation of new disease genes, and screen a limited number of pharmacological interventions through our method. Together, the proposed developmental plan and research strategy will foster my ability to lead an independent research program, to establish cellular profiling as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine. Project Narrative: The functional interpretation of genetic variation in diseases faces critical roadblocks, due to the lack of scalable methods to assess the significance of candidate variants experimentally, while accounting for genomic context. This proposal introduces a morphological profiling method, that is able to rapidly identify disease-associated phenotypes in patient cells and offers a cost-efficient and unbiased way to determine the significance of putative pathogenic variants at scale.

"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10177882,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,31970
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10245285,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,761822
"Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Over one in one hundred infants born are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which can cause a host of debilitating symptoms including early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Application of whole exome/genome sequencing to examine NDD has revealed many disease-causing variations, but in a substantial proportion of cases the genetic cause remains undetermined. The analysis of deep-intronic non-coding variants has provided diagnosis when coding variation cannot be implicated in disease. For example, intronic variants in the “20N” poison exon of SCN1A results in loss of function, causing Dravet Syndrome, an NDD causing prolonged seizures in the first year of life. Poison exons are a mechanism of gene regulation whereby a premature termination codon caused by inclusion of the poison exon induces nonsense- mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. Preliminary analysis has shown that poison exon inclusion (PEI) in SCN1A and SCN8A decreases during embryonic brain development, inversely proportional to total RNA expression. The brain is a hotbed of alternative splicing during early neuronal development therefore it is plausible, if not probable that novel poison exons remain uncharacterized. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that PEI is a mechanism to differentiallyregulate gene expression during earlyneuronal development, and intronic variants affecting PEI in genes of developmental importance contribute to disease phenotype. In Aim 1, the sodium and calcium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit families will be assessed to detect and characterize novel poison exons. Known and novel PEI will then be determined in the developing brain using publicly available RNA-seq experiments. In Aim 2 this analysis will be scaled up over 100-fold to detect and assess PEI in over 3000 genes associated with NDD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the developing brain and the driving forces of PEI evolution will be assessed. Comparative analysis of poison exons will be conducted using k-means hierarchical clustering and unsupervised random forest machine learning methodologies to determine prime biological factors driving PEI utilization. In Aim 3, intronic variants will be analyzed in probands of NDD and ASD in regions of known and hypothetical PEI and the affect these variants have on disease phenotype will be computationally assessed. These experiments will reveal new insights into alternative splicing in the developing brain and provide potential genetic explanation of currently unknown NDD disease phenotype. The research will be conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, which allows developing scientists to hone skills in a dynamic, hands-on environment with supplemental training courses as necessary. Besides the research outlined in the proposal, training will include courses in conduct of responsible research, advanced biostatistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and wet lab techniques next to personal development to improve oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as time management. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) are debilitating early-onset diseases estimated to affect 1-2% of the population, and the cause of a substantial proportion of these cases remains unknown. Our lab has recently implicated causative variants in poison exons, a cryptic alternatively spliced exon causing transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. The proposed research aims to examine the role of poison exon inclusion in the regulation of genes associated with NDD during neurological development, providing insights into alternative splicing in the brain and provide essential information for diagnosis and potential therapeutics for patients with NDD.",Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder,10234717,F31MH126628,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channel', 'Catalogs', 'Cations', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Onset of illness', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Truncation', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'SCN8A gene', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Sodium', 'Sodium Channel', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Terminator Codon', 'Tetrapoda', 'Therapeutic', 'Time Management', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'disabling symptom', 'disease phenotype', 'dravet syndrome', 'driving force', 'early onset', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Precursor', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'random forest', 'responsible research conduct', 'scale up', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'voltage', 'voltage gated channel']",NIMH,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,F31,2021,42792
"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders.

"Glaucoma Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Integration of Image-Based Phenotypes and Genetic Associations PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This proposal describes a 5-year training program to develop an academic career focused on improving glaucoma risk prediction through a combination of genomic and phenotypic risk. I will use supervised, semi- supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to define novel structural and longitudinal image based endophenotypes for POAG aligned with disease subtype and progression. These endophenotypes will be used to discover new disease associated genomic loci. By including longitudinal data, we aim to identify genetic markers for progressive disease. We will use known POAG risk variants and novel genetic variants identified in these analyses to create several candidate genome wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for POAG. Each candidate PRS with and without addition of demographic and image features will be tested for its utility to predict glaucoma risk is independent NEIGHBORHOOD and LIFE cohorts. We hypothesize that a PRS based on genetic variants associated with our endophenotypes will have improved POAG case predictive power compared to PRS based on cross-sectional genome wide association studies. The proposed studies have the potential to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and improve predictive power of genetic testing  I am well positioned to conduct this research and undertake the training proposed here. I have a strong quantitative science background with a degree in engineering, statistical training and established track records of large database research. Additionally, I have proposed a detailed career development plan that will allow me to 1) learn the fundamentals, applications and limitations of machine learning based approaches for automated fundus image analysis and 2) understand computational biology and statistical approaches to handle large genomics datasets. My training plan includes an MPH in quantitative methods at the HSPH with concentration in computational biology and statistical learning. Additionally, I am supported by a multidisciplinary team of committed mentors dedicated to my academic growth and progression into an independent clinician scientist. I will work with glaucoma genetics experts, Drs Wiggs and Segre, and leaders in statistical and machine learning, Drs Elze and Kalpathy-Cramer. I will have full access to the extensive resources at MEE, Partners Healthcare and the Harvard system for this work and my career development.  The research outlined here will improve our understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and lay the foundation for development of multimodal precision medicine approaches for glaucoma screening and diagnosis. This research is cutting edge and prepares me well for my career as an independent NIH funded investigator with the aim to use longitudinal multi-modal clinical, imaging, testing and multi-omics data in multi- ethnic glaucoma patients to 1) understand pathways of vision loss, 2) develop precision medicine approaches to pre-symptomatically identify patients at high risk of functional vision loss and progression and 3) make these technologies a clinical reality in order to reduce the burden of unnecessary blindness. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is a progressive, irreversible optic neuropathy with variable presentation and clinical course and we currently lack the ability to pre-symptomatically distinguish patients at risk of severe and progressive disease from those individuals unlikely to develop glaucoma-related vision loss. Using existing data from two large biobanks, this project will use cutting edge machine learning approaches to define POAG phenotypes aligned with disease subtype and progression, use these to discover novel disease related genetic associations, and test their utility for identifying glaucoma cases in independent cohorts. Ultimately, we aim to develop a precision medicine approach using imaging and genetic features to improve our assessment of disease risk for any individual.",Glaucoma Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Integration of Image-Based Phenotypes and Genetic Associations,10191922,K23EY032634,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Blindness', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Accounting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Progressive Disease', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'functional loss', 'fundus imaging', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high intraocular pressure', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,K23,2021,263101
"Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD Abstract  This project seeks to further our understanding of the genetic influences on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One approach to increasing sample sizes for molecular genetic studies of MDD and thereby increasing power to detect genetic loci is to assess individuals using surveys that are shorter and more efficient than full clinical assessments. This `minimal phenotyping' leads to identification of risk loci that may not be specific to strictly defined MDD and can be associated with a variety of psychiatric phenotypes. While these discoveries are important to understand the overall biology of complex mental and psychiatric outcomes, they offer little direct and actionable insight into the biological underpinning of strictly defined MDD which shows increased severity, impairment, and recurrence risk and accounts for a disproportionate impact on disability and morbidity in comparison to liberally defined MDD. Recently, large biobanks surveying tens to hundreds of thousands of subjects across hundreds to thousands of variables and EHR records have been become available to the scientific community. Combining rich phenotype data with genome-wide genotyping or sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to leverage these resources to advance discovery and understanding of the genetic influences on MDD. One major challenge is the lack of uniform measures that allow assessment of strictly defined MDD, impairment, severity, and recurrence risk. This lack of `deep phenotyping' while pragmatic in allowing the assembly of large samples, creates challenges in accurate determinations of controls, non-specific mild cases, and strictly defined cases. We have previously shown how machine learning (ML) analysis methods can leverage this type of heterogeneous, broad, but light collection of information to predict and quantify risk in subjects not deeply assessed. While there is significant room for improvement in these predictions, the resulting effective sample size and power to detect specific liability loci increased dramatically when this method was applied. In Aim 1, we plan to evaluate 2 families of ML methods that can be used to predict unmeasured and specific strictly defined MDD risk. In Aim 2, we propose to use these predictions of risk in genetic association analyses to detect common genetic variation that influences risk specific to strictly defined MDD. Finally, we will make our biobank adapted ML method pipeline available to the broader psychiatric genetics research community which is expected to improve power and loci detection for other psychiatric disorders.   NARRATIVE  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common psychiatric disorder, a leading cause of disability worldwide, and partially influenced by genetics. Rigorous clinical assessments are generally needed for studies to distinguish between genetic loci influencing mild versus debilitating manifestations of the disorder. We propose to evaluate and adapt machine learning methods to estimate risk to strictly defined MDD in large-scale biobanks samples that measure many variables but may not contain rigorous clinical assessments and use these predictions to discover additional genetic variation specifically influencing MDD.",Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD,10196078,R21MH126358,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'biobank', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'psychogenetics', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'statistical and machine learning', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'vector']",NIMH,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R21,2021,208389
"Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning Project Summary This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias, differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson (expert in advanced statistics). The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce- Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2) use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stages—reducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Narrative The development and validation of predictive models is a critical step toward improving strategies for an early diagnosis of sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other neurodegenerative diseases and improving strategies for personalized treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel imaging genetic biomarkers that can help clinicians with an early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sporadic FTD.

"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10219797,K01MH123896,"['Affect', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'genomic profiles', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'open source', 'programs', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K01,2021,111394
"Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health Identifying how genetic variation leads to neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders provides new means to study, predict, prevent and treat disease. Identifying the immediate molecular consequences of disease- associated genetic variation has necessitated the development of large-scale, multi-tissue functional genomic resources. Projects such as GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and PsychENCODE have combined molecular QTL mapping and epigenomic maps in bulk tissues to interpret various disease-associated genetic variants. However, few colocalizations between molecular QTLs and traits have been robustly identified and few causal variants mapped. As tissues like the brain constitute 100s of cell-types, we hypothesize that existing maps may mask the contributions of disease-associated variation in less-abundant cell types. One extremely powerful approach to identify cell-type specific molecular effects and their relationship to genetic diseases is through application of chromatin accessibility data – these data both allow inference of causal cell types and provide base level resolution gene regulation. Our team has considerable expertise in connecting GWAS to molecular functions and predicting causal variants through use of chromatin accessibility data. We have additionally recently collaborated to generate a comprehensive, multi-individual map single cell ATAC- seq map (scATAC-seq) of six different brain regions to detect causal cell types and predict causal variants. This work has been recently demonstrated in our fine-mapping study of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Corces et al, bioRxiv, 2020) but has not been systematically applied to mental health disorders. We propose to develop statistical genetics and machine learning approaches that advance the use of scATAC-seq data to connecting mental health GWAS loci to specific cell types, mechanisms and causal variants. In Aim 1, we will assemble a pipeline that leverages region and cell type-specific scATAC-seq data to identify pathological cell types for 100s of mental health and brain-related traits. We will also enhance the detection of cell-type specific molecular mechanisms by extending and applying a novel GWAS/QTL colocalization approach. Throughout these activities, variants will be validated using massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA). In Aim 2, we will develop sophisticated machine learning models that learn regulatory grammars and score variants across the allele frequency spectrum. Predicted causal variants in GWAS loci will be further assessed with MPRAs in Aim 1 and applied in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how improved detection of causal variants using our single-cell informed models aids transferability of polygenic risk scores across populations.  We will provide open resources and reproducible computational methods and pipelines that integrate single cell chromatin accessibility data from multiple brain regions. This will allow detection cell-type specific genetic effects and pathological cell types in mental health GWAS, establish robust causal links between variants, genes and disease, and improve prediction of disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Identifying causal genetic variants in mental health disease is a major challenge limiting interpretation of disease biology, prediction of risk and development of therapies. Our work will develop computational approaches to identify these variants, interpret molecular disease mechanisms and predict individual risks.",Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health,10116649,R01MH125244,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Mus', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reporter', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'brain cell', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'polygenic risk score', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'regression algorithm', 'risk prediction', 'success', 'therapy development', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,618007
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,10126058,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual', 'virtual intervention']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,369515
"Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in discovery of genetic variants and genes associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. Altered gene expression in the brain, particularly at the cell-type-specific level, is believed to be a driving factor in conferring risk through these genetic variants. To link altered transcription to psychopathology, an immense amount of transcriptomic data is being accumulated, including single-cell and tissue level transcriptomes. Some of these samples cover critical developmental periods. An outstanding challenge is how to integrate single cell and tissue level transcriptomic data and how genetic variation alters transcription in specific cells to produce psychopathology. In this high dimensional ‘omics setting, we need powerful statistical and machine learning tools to produce integrative analyses and mesh those results with large psychiatric genetic datasets to achieve new insights. We propose to use our expertise in high dimensional statistical inference to tackle this challenge. We go beyond machine learning models that specialize in prediction, focusing instead on providing interpretable statistical inferences. We identify gene communities, defined in terms of cell type and spatiotemporal window, driving risk. With vast amounts of data comes great risk of spurious inferences based on non-rigorous analyses. On the other hand, reliable, but naïve tools can sacrifice power by not fully integrating all available information. Our overall objective to produce analytic tools that yield reliable and powerful inferences relating cell-type-specific gene expression with genetic risk factors. With these analytical tools made available to the research community, our longer-term goal is to hasten discoveries in the field and thus build the foundation from which therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders emerge. Our objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific aims: 1) statistically rigorous methods to select cell-type markers and to estimate cell-type-specific (CTS) expression, which will facilitate downstream analyses, including CTS eQTLs from tissue; 2) modeling dynamic gene communities throughout development of cell lineages or tissue and relating them to community-based-score statistics to gain insight into the impact of genetic risk factors on psychiatric disorders; and 3) novel methods for estimating gene co-expression networks from single cell RNA-seq. This contribution is significant because it will make many transcriptomic resources more valuable and enable downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS eQTLs in larger sample sets with higher power. Dynamic network analysis tools enhance our ability to identify gene communities that vary over developmental epochs and this variation facilitates inferences that relate cell type and developmental period with risk factors. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses novel statistical methods for integrative analysis of data from multiple sources, and cutting edge results to represent high dimensional data in a meaningful way that lends itself to clustering and network analysis. The statistical tools and results arising from the proposed research are relevant to public health because they will generate a deeper understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the refined methods and new results provided by our research will be directly useful for the research community as they hunt for ways to prevent or treat mental disorders.",Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data,10144504,R01MH123184,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain cell', 'case control', 'cell type', 'critical developmental period', 'gene discovery', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychogenetics', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505168
"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us).

"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,R01HD105256,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Etiology', 'Fathers', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematology', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Multiomic Data', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy loss', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data repository', 'early pregnancy', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lipidomics', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment center', 'whole genome']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1465292
"Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the world's most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries. NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF). Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF. The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low- resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable, portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below 6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be saved through simple, cost-effective treatments. Early diagnosis starting at birth is critical for implementing effective disease management, but newborn screening is a challenge for low resource environments where a decentralized, point-of-care solution is needed. This project enables our affordable, point-of-care platform based on microchip electrophoresis technology to accurately perform newborn screening.",Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease,10255480,R43HL156685,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Electrophoresis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genotype', 'Ghana', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin E Disease', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'India', 'Infant', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Microchip Electrophoresis', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Population', 'Race', 'Reagent', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Cell Trait', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Southeastern Asia', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'beta Globin', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preventable death', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sickling', 'spectrograph', 'trait']",NHLBI,"HEMEX HEALTH, INC.",R43,2021,256580
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,10192782,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,190941
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",10139101,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,341300
