"Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks Project Summary  Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.  Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.  The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein- protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small molecules that can target individual proteins. Project Narrative This project focuses on the modeling and incorporation of protein three-dimensional structures across the human proteome to further our ability to describe disease-related protein-protein interaction networks in tissue- and tumor-specific contexts. These structure-informed networks will reveal mechanistic insights regarding cellular processes underlying human diseases ranging from cancer to those resulting from viral and bacterial infection. Our results will also provide hypotheses regarding drugs that can target proteins in these networks.",Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks,10086553,R35GM139585,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'druggable target', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'insight', 'link protein', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R35,2021,405000
"Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY) Project Summary There is an unmet need in medicine and basic sciences for accurate atomic structures of proteins. This need surpasses the capabilities of traditional high-resolution experimental methods. With machine learning advances, structure prediction algorithms are poised to provide atomic models for these areas in the near future. Yet, the gaps in prediction algorithms limit accuracy and reliability, particularly for large multi-domain proteins, protein complexes, and flexible proteins. Our proposal, Towards Accurate protein structure Predictions with SAXS TechnologY (TAPESTRY), will create technology to increase reliability and improve accuracy of protein structure predictions through experimental validation, particularly for difficult proteins. TAPESTRY is innovative by combining our strengths in high-throughput synchrotron SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) data collection and analysis with the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP), which assesses structure predictions against “gold standard”, not-yet-released crystal structures every two years. Through CASP, we take advantage of the collective protein folding knowledge of the global community of structure prediction scientists. Our approach is strategic. We provide SAXS data for CASP, giving prediction scientists access to experimental data. We develop analytical and experimental tools, designed for prediction scientists to overcome current gaps that limit the use of SAXS data. We test these tools against our TAPESTRY databases of standard proteins, with corresponding crystal structures, SAXS data, and predicted models. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our technology through CASP and obtain an unbiased assessment of our tools and the state of the field. As a first step, we target well-folded proteins (Aim 1) and proteins with disordered tails (Aim 2) in this proposal. The feasibility of our technology proposal is supported by our current data and proofs-in-concepts, our beamline capabilities, and proven experience in SAXS analysis. We show that experimental SAXS data, which contains distance information that can act as restraints in protein structure prediction algorithms, match crystal structures of well-folded proteins and score predictions based on topological accuracy. We show cases in CASP13 (2018) when SAXS data improved the fold of predicted models. SAXS data collection is rapid (10 seconds), does not require labeling or crystallization, and is available at no cost to the scientific community. We have proven experience in developing informative and effective SAXS analytical tools. Our long-term goal is to enable biomedical researchers to input an amino acid sequence and rapidly obtain an experimentally validated and accurate atomic model(s) that reflects the protein conformation(s) in solution. If TAPESTRY is successful, the increased availability of such atomic models will have strong and broad potential to advance biomedical research and impact all areas of biology in which proteins are involved. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atomic structures are critical for medical science from understanding how proteins function to drug design. Structure prediction algorithms could provide atomic models for these purposes in the near future. This proposal will leverage the structure-based technology, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), to develop methods to experimentally validate these atomic models and increase their accuracy.",Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY),10171872,R01GM137021,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bypass', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'beamline', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'risk prediction', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2021,406940
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,10189648,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Hi-C', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,308756
"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,10132358,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein data bank', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,514097
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,10075288,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,317007
"Combined computational and structural studies to create novel macromolecular recognition properties PROJECT SUMMARY The design of macromolecular binding interactions and complexes, and corresponding alteration of binding specificity, is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of protein-protein complexes (which are driven by a enthalpic changes established primarily by stereochemical complementarity, balanced against large competing entropic changes) and for the redesign of protein-DNA complexes (which are heavily dependent upon DNA bending, hydrogen-bonds, electrostatic contacts, and the presence of solvent and counterions throughout the molecular interface). Over the past several years we have collaborated with several computational groups to help develop and validate computational approaches for the design and optimization of protein-protein recognition, protein-DNA recognition, and protein-small molecule recognition. Those studies have contributed to several new computational engineering approaches, including hybrid strategies that combine ab initio design of protein folds and binding sites, the ‘Rotamer Interaction Feld’ (RIF) docking protocol for efficient sampling of protein sequence and conformation, and novel parametric design approaches to create new tandem repeat proteins. We propose to continue this work through two specific aims to further develop and improve upon computational approaches for protein design. As part of this project, we will solve atomic resolution crystal structures of many selected and designed molecular complexes and provide them to our immediate collaborators as well as to a public structure prediction project, for computational prediction challenges. Aim 1. We will design and characterize novel self-associating circular tandem repeat proteins (using both de novo computational design and using high-throughput selections) and then further design them to undergo ligand-induced protein-protein association. Beyond the challenge of combining protein scaffold design and ligand binding design, the motivation for this aim is to determine the structural and mechanistic features of small molecule ligand-binding, and balance of forces, that facilitate ligand-induced protein-protein association. Aim 2. We will improve our understanding and ability to design novel protein-DNA recognition specificities and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will: (1) Systematically select and optimize a series of variants of a model DNA-binding protein, that display altered binding specificity across two regions of partially overlapping sequential clusters of basepairs and neighboring protein residues. (2) Determine the high-resolution structures and binding behavior of each construct. (3) Supervise blinded computational efforts, using multiple approaches, to predict the same structures. (4) Compare and analyze the results of computational predictions versus multiple computational prediction strategies to define features influencing predictive accuracy. For both aims, we will further exploit our crystallographic structures by computationally ‘reverse engineering’ each construct using validated protein structures, to further understand the performance of design approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The redesign of a macromolecular binding interfaces and corresponding alteration of specificity is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to structure-based computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of novel protein-protein complexes and binding specificities, as well as for the creation of new DNA-binding proteins.

"Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Structural biology provides a powerful lens through which to view living systems. With advances in algorithms and computing, molecular simulations have begun to complement traditional experimental approaches as tools for discovery. At the same time, data-intensive machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly important in biology, fueled by the rapid growth in high-throughput experimentation. Research in my laboratory applies techniques from structural biology, molecular simulation, and machine learning to design new protein structures and predict protein interactions. We design new protein structures in order to better understand the principles of protein folding and to create highly stable and robust molecular scaffolds for a range of biomedical applications including multivalent display of binding or signaling domains, hosting of binding or catalytic sites, and use as building blocks to assemble higher-order complexes. We predict protein interactions in order to better understand the principles of macromolecular recognition and to gain insight into the process by which the adaptive immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Our research during the project period will be directed toward two broad goals: de novo design and functionalization of tandem repeat proteins, and prediction of peptide-MHC recognition by T cell receptors (TCRs). The proposed protein design work builds on our recent progress designing circular tandem repeat proteins with a range of repeat numbers and diameters and applying these designs as multivalent display scaffolds for the presentation of binding and signalling domains. Our TCR studies leverage the tools we have recently developed to model—structurally and bioinformatically—repertoires of T cell receptors and their peptide:MHC specificity. Looking ahead, I am optimistic that by combining atomically-detailed molecular simulations and data-intensive machine learning techniques we will be able to generate designed protein constructs and predictive algorithms that have a significant positive impact on human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop new computer algorithms for designing protein structures and predicting protein interactions. The rationally designed proteins that we create will have potential uses as molecular scaffolds in a wide range of biomedical applications including diagnostics and cellular therapies.

"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost. This project will develop cutting-edge computational methods based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reliably predict protein structures from sequence information alone.

"Center for Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) PROJECT SUMMARY  Experimental determination of protein structure often provides atomic accuracy models, but is inherently time- consuming, often costly, and not always possible. Computational modeling is currently less accurate, but offers an alternative approach when experimental results are not available. The goal of CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is to advance the protein structure modeling field by conducting community-wide experiments that objectively determine the strengths and weaknesses of current methods and so foster progress. Approximately 100 research groups world-wide participate. In the most recent experiment (2018), there were 57,000 submissions in nine modeling categories, including over 35,000 tertiary structure models. The Center provides the infrastructure for CASP and Aim 1 is the continued development and operation of this resource. Principal tasks include registration and communication with participants; solicitation, characterization, and management of modeling targets; collection and validation of models; and extensive numerical analysis of submissions. These operations are supported by a secure and robust data infrastructure. The Center also develops evaluation, analysis, and display software, and provides access to models and evaluation results. CASP relies on independent assessors, experts in modeling or a related experimental field, to interpret the results. The Center coordinates this process, providing evaluation data and, when necessary, implementing new evaluation methods.  Recent CASPs have shown dramatic improvements in model accuracy, especially for the most difficult cases where homology modeling cannot be used. A major factor driving progress is the use of new machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks. These and related methods appear poised to make further major advances in a number of key modeling areas. The plan for the next period of the project is designed to capitalize on these and other opportunities for progress. Greater success with modeling small proteins and domains dictates a shift in emphasis to the still challenging area of large multi-domain proteins and complexes (Aim 2), where progress is expected both from the machine learning developments and from the incorporation of sparse experimental data. Although accuracy of models has improved, it is still seldom competitive with experiment. Aim 3 is to pursue strategies that will make models more accurate and useful, by nurturing further progress in refining initial models, better methods for estimating model accuracy, and assessment of the utility of models. Aim 4 introduces new ways of strengthening interactions between CASP and the broader research community, providing models that directly address contemporary problems (for example, for CoV-2 protein structures) and boosting communications through meetings, webinars, publications and other means. PROJECT NARRATIVE Knowledge of macromolecular structure plays a crucial role in biology and medicine, allowing for detailed studies and understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms. Yet, relatively few structures are obtained experimentally - the rest must be modeled.

"Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures Advances in biophysical technologies have accelerated our ability to probe the mechanisms of even the most complex cellular systems, and such studies have enabled researchers to design modifications to known protein structures and design completely new proteins. This “protein design” technology has given rise to an ability to manipulate protein structures as a means of improving on or introducing new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. The bases of these studies rely on computational modeling of protein candidates, although the accuracy of protein structure prediction, protein de novo design, and single-mutation effects prediction remain below the threshold for many use cases, such as structure-guided drug design and rational enzyme engineering. Thus, success of a protein engineering effort relies on high-resolution structure determination, which involves laborious screening and optimization in order to obtain stable proteins or active enzyme variants. However, our ability to observe protein structure using common structure determination strategies (X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)) lags far behind our ability to design and produce new sequences, creating a knowledge gap that prevents biochemists from accessing the range of protein functions seen in nature. While current technologies enable rapid synthesis of hundreds of proteins with varied sequences, there do not exist technologies for rapid structural characterization of these generated proteins. The ability to obtain high- resolution structural information for hundreds of sequences in parallel would provide invaluable insights in protein engineering methods. Importantly, rapid structure determination would enable structural characterization of genetic variation in the human genome underlying disease by enabling the structural and mechanistic interpretation of rare and de novo disease-related variants. Cryo-EM enables numerous high-resolution structures to be determined from a small amount of sample without requiring homogeneity, an aspect of this method that we plan to exploit for parallel elucidation of protein structures. We will establish the feasibility of this technique for rapidly investigate the structures of engineered protein libraries, where the molecular weight range is near or below the lower detection limit of cryo-EM. We will also probe the limits of our ability to identify the location and structural impact of tested mutations at limited structural locations, such as active sites. We will explore the feasibility of our parallel structure determination approach in two aims: Aim 1 will identify the limit of current single-particle analysis methods to discriminate between structurally similar protein complexes. Aim 2 will implement machine learning algorithms to push the current limits of classification using a combination of synthetic and real data. These exploratory studies will pave the way to rapid structure determination of multiple protein complexes from a single cryo-EM experiment, providing the ability to rapidly obtain high-resolution structures for many engineered proteins, thereby enabling unprecedented design and testing feedback cycles to help treat human disease. Narrative Our understanding of structure-function relationships has matured to the point that we can now manipulate the composition of proteins as a means of producing diagnostics or therapeutics for human disease. However, in order to fully elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of function that drive these protein design studies, structures of the designed proteins must be determined. However, structure determination is a massive bottleneck, which we plan to overcome by establishing a platform for massively parallelized structure determination of protein targets that is commensurate with the rate of protein production involved in protein design studies.",Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures,10231713,R21GM142196,"['Active Sites', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Biotechnology', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Heart', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'de novo mutation', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detection limit', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'particle', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'rapid technique', 'screening', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,221875
