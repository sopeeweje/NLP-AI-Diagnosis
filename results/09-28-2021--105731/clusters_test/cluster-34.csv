"Innovative Vaccine Approaches ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Innovative Vaccine Approaches, organized by Drs. Mariagrazia Pizza, Galit Alter and Gordon Dougan. The conference will be held in Vancouver, Canada from June 27- July 1, 2021. Vaccines have the power to prevent and potentially eradicate a wide range of infectious diseases, representing one of the most effective life-saving measures at our disposal against global health threats. The recent coronavirus pandemic has brought the importance and urgency of vaccine development efforts into sharp focus. Moreover, the vaccinology field is evolving very rapidly, thanks to advances in our understanding of microbiology, immunology and genomics, as well as advances in structural analysis of antigens and antigen- antibody complexes and impacts of variation. Over the years, this field has also experienced an elucidation of mechanisms of immunity and protection, and identification of correlates. However, many questions are still unsolved and innovative approaches are needed to address new vaccine challenges like antimicrobial resistance, emerging infectious diseases, cancer and diseases associated with our aging population. This conference will cover the latest advances and novel approaches towards vaccine development, including: (1) novel antigen delivery systems; (2) in vitro and in vivo model systems for vaccine appraisal (3) the use of human challenge models; (4) the role of ‘systems biology’ in the comprehensive analysis of immune correlates, biomarker identification and safety; (5) machine-learning approaches to define correlations between antibody repertoires and protection; and (6) strategies for developing low cost vaccines for economically challenged populations. Together these topics will provide attendees with the new ideas and tools to continue to forge new frontiers in vaccine capabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vaccines have the power to prevent and potentially eradicate a wide range of both infectious and non- infectious diseases. The field is evolving very rapidly due to improvements in our understanding of microbiology, immunology and genomics, as well as advances in structural analysis techniques. This conference will accelerate advances the field, bringing together public and private communities to ensure the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemics that afflict the population. This event provides a unique opportunity for discussion of the key challenges in making low cost vaccines for economically challenged populations and how to address burning topics such as pandemics, antimicrobial resistance, emerging infectious diseases, cancer and an aging population.",Innovative Vaccine Approaches,10237543,R13AI161938,"['Address', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Biological Models', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Canada', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immersion', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'frontier', 'global health', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'manufacturability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'pandemic disease', 'posters', 'prevent', 'symposium', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine discovery', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2021,8000
"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,10092924,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'rapid test', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2021,199831
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10171553,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serology test', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2021,201875
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10080700,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory pathogen', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,2648626

"NBER Center for Aging and Health Research OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Lessons for COVID-19 from the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 There is currently great concern about the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue is how non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) impact the spread of the disease and, hence, fatality rates. A second is the inequality in infection rates and deaths across people with different socioeconomic characteristics. The goal of this project is to draw lessons for today from the Great Influenza Pandemic, which began in spring 1918, peaked during a second wave in late 1918 and early 1919, persisted through 1920, and cumulatively killed 40 million people worldwide. Using a combination of cross-city and cross-national analyses, the project will study how disease outcomes from the Great Influenza Pandemic relate to variations in population demographics and patterns of NPI use. The project will assess how disease outcomes relate to the types and durations of non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions implemented across geographic locations and over time. It will characterize the NPIs that were adopted during the Great Influenza Pandemic in terms of type, intensity, and duration of application. Among the NPIs to be considered are school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. The project will analyze variations in infections, deaths, population demographics, and NPI use across at least 45 large US cities, 48 countries, and cities in Spain and England, where high-frequency data are available on flu-related excess mortality. The project will be conducted as a supplement to grant P30-AG012810, the NBER Center for Aging and Health Research. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 is the historical case that offers the greatest opportunity for drawing lessons for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,10183147,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2021,729285
"Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines ABSTRACT Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these 3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific, tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific, CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently, >25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses, interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays (signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria affects over two billion people, killing over 400,000 individuals each year mostly children in Africa. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria from defined geographical areas. The ideal tool would be a highly effective, long-acting vaccine that prevents infection, and thereby disease and parasite transmission. There is currently no alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating that a vaccine candidate exhibits performance superior to current SPZ vaccines Therefore, in this project we will develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate if a human will be protected against Pf infection by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines.",Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines,10086740,U01AI155354,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Aotus primate', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Geographic Locations', 'Germany', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Interferons', 'Interleukin-12', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Liver', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Organ', 'Parasites', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Regimen', 'Safety', 'Seminal', 'Serum', 'Spleen', 'Sporozoite vaccine', 'Sporozoites', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'asexual', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'cost', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'lymph nodes', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'protective efficacy', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'volunteer']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",U01,2021,942943
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,10126805,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,1224163
"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,10176257,R01HD100542,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feces', 'Folic Acid', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Panama', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Peru', 'Peruvian', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Role', 'Rotavirus', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Rotavirus Vaccines', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'folic acid supplementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health disparity', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'infant gut microbiome', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'socioeconomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stool sample', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccinology']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,644656
"Combinatorial and computational design of bnAb mRNA vaccines for HIV Many HIV vaccine candidates have failed clinical trials, as they were unable to elicit a potent and durable response to HIV viral challenge. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been identified in a number of HIV+ individuals with well-controlled viral levels, and these bnAbs target epitopes that contain residues that are relatively conserved across viral strains. It is thought bnAbs may have efficacy against various strains of HIV pathogen. It is therefore widely believed that systems which induce a potent immune response that includes the generation of broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) in humans could be effective HIV vaccines, and help to mitigate the wide genetic diversity in envelope proteins and relatively high mutation rate of HIV. However, developing a vaccine which can elicit the production of these bnAbs in vivo has proven to be extremely challenging. This is likely due to the complex affinity maturation process that is required to produce bnAbs. Immunization protocols typically administer a single dose of antigen (prime dose), which is sometimes followed by a “boost” dose delivered several weeks later. In a traditional bolus immunization, the half-life of the antigen present in lymph nodes is generally shorter than the time scale over which germinal centres start producing higher affinity IgG antibodies relative to the initial IgM response (~18 hrs). In contrast, natural infections expose the immune system to escalating antigen and inflammation over days to weeks, resulting in the formation of a germinal centre with dynamic antigen presentation. This germinal centre niche also supports activation of antigen presenting cells, T follicular helper cells, and appropriate cytokine signalling to generate bnAbs. It is likely that to develop effective bnAbs, sophisticated vaccination techniques which can more closely mimic natural infections and natural bnAb formation may be required. We believe that to develop a successful HIV vaccine, researchers must aim to engineer more sophisticated and biomimetic vaccines. Bioengineered vaccines should therefore consider three key parameters in parallel; 1) delivery of an appropriately selected antigen, with 2) favourable kinetics of antigen expression, and 3) control of the immune response in the germinal centre. We believe lymph node targeted delivery of computationally designed mRNA antigens inside immunostimulatory lipid nanoparticles (mRNA LNPs) administered with computationally optimized immunization protocols will address these three aspects in a unique way. Additionally,Translate Bio will provide expertise in manufacturing considerations for mRNA therapeutics. As modifications to mRNA structure may impact the mRNA antigen translation, stability, and immunogenicity, the input of our translational partner (Translate Bio) will allow us to develop vaccines with a potential avenue for commercial development. This R61/R33 proposal combines our expertise in computational antigen design, HIV immunology, combinatorial chemistry, and the commercialisation of mRNA therapeutics to develop a new class of HIV mRNA vaccine candidates. HIV remains a global pandemic with no effective vaccine. Here we propose to combine computational and experimental methods to develop an mRNA nanovaccine which produces broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV, by engineering antigen composition, mRNA structure, and immunostimulating mRNA nanoformulations for enhanced immunity.",Combinatorial and computational design of bnAb mRNA vaccines for HIV,10237019,R61AI161805,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Belief', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Bolus Infusion', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'HIV', 'HIV Antigens', 'HIV vaccine', 'HIV-1', 'HLA-A gene', 'Half-Life', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunologic Tests', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA vaccine', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'System', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'adoptive B cell transfer', 'cell behavior', 'clinical development', 'clinical translation', 'combinatorial', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'efficacy validation', 'env Gene Products', 'humanized mouse', 'immune activation', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'lipid nanoparticle', 'lymph nodes', 'mRNA delivery', 'models and simulation', 'molecular dynamics', 'mouse model', 'nanoformulation', 'nanoparticle delivery', 'nanotherapeutic', 'nanovaccine', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'response', 'targeted delivery', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R61,2021,568747
"The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response It is estimated that approximately half of HIV-infected individuals in the United States are over 50 years of age. Aging of the HIV-infected population has linked alterations in immune responses associated with age and the immunologic consequences of chronic HIV infection. This intersection of HIV and aging will influence host defense against infection and response to vaccines. As a result, understanding the nexus of HIV-associated immune activation and immunosenescence takes on particular urgency. We will leverage insights from our published and ongoing studies on the effects of aging on dysregulated innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function, a novel population of pro-inflammatory IL-7 receptor alow effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells that are expanded in HIV-negative older adults, and on expansion of EM CD8 T cells in older HIV-positive adults. We have also elucidated gene expression and immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older HIV-negative adults. These findings position us to illuminate the effects of aging and HIV infection on innate and adaptive immune function, particularly following influenza vaccination. To address these questions, we have assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in the study of aging of the innate and adaptive human immune systems, and in HIV immunology, biology and clinical care. Our overarching hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory environment associated with age and with suppressed HIV infection potentiates immunosenescence in older adults with HIV disease. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll young (age 21-35) and older (age over 65) adults with HIV infection receiving high-dose influenza vaccine. We will employ state of the art methods including multichannel mass cytometry on whole blood to assess development and activation of major populations (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils), including novel studies of platelets pre- and post-vaccine. We will evaluate innate immune PRR function (including Toll-like and NOD-like receptor family members), where we previously found age-associated alterations in cytokine production and costimulatory protein expression that were related to influenza vaccine response. We will also study T cell responses to in vitro vaccine antigen stimulation, including the IL-7 receptor alow EM CD8 T cell subset. Statistical modeling will include clinical and functional covariates (e.g. CD4+ T cell count, estimated duration of HIV disease and of ART, medical co-morbidities, medication use, functional status). Finally, we will derive gene expression signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older adults with HIV disease, and compare these to those we previously identified in HIV-negative adults. We will employ state of the art analytic methods to integrate gene expression and immunologic data to obtain a comprehensive view of the human immune response in the context of age and immune suppression. These studies ultimately are aimed at identifying pathways amenable to pharmacologic targeting to improve immune and vaccine responses in older (and young) adults with HIV disease. The proposed studies focus on understanding how aging and HIV infection affect the function of the immune system, particularly in response to influenza vaccination, to identify cell types and biologic pathways that are potential targets for the development of treatments to improve immune function.",The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response,10183118,R01AG055362,"['20 year old', '21 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Antibodies', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cell Count', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Family member', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV-1', 'Head', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Interleukin 7 Receptor', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toll-like receptors', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccines', 'Whole Blood', 'age effect', 'analytical method', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'functional status', 'human old age (65+)', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'immune system function', 'immunosenescence', 'improved', 'inflammatory milieu', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'innate immune function', 'insight', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'receptor function', 'recruit', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine response', 'young adult']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,779116
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine.

"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Our new methods, their applications to VAERS database, and their dissemination will facilitate the entire research network for pursuing temporal related discovery with high methodological rigor.",Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS,10097968,R01AI130460,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'base', 'data access', 'data repository', 'detection method', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information model', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'unstructured data', 'vaccine safety']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,669017
"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into IND-enabling studies.",Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,10211103,R43AI152652,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing Alternatives', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Baculoviruses', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Body mass index', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Economic Burden', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Ferrets', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Ha antigen', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Insecta', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recombinants', 'Seasons', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Serology test', 'Severities', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Spanish flu', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Antigens', 'Switzerland', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Translations', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Antigens', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiviral immunity', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'flu', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'infection rate', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'mutant', 'neutralizing antibody', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine effectiveness']",NIAID,"BIOLOGICAL MIMETICS, INC.",R43,2021,299218
"Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, pulmonary influenza infection occurs annually in 5-20% of the population with mortality in the range of 30,000 deaths. The recent 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic illustrated the potential for higher infection rates, which were reported to be as high as 45% in certain age groups. The 2017-18 influenza season had the highest pediatric mortalities since the 2009 pandemic. Influenza infection is known to result in a broad spectrum of disease phenotypes in humans, although severe pneumonia is relatively rare. Despite this, severe disease often requires advanced supportive care in the young, including previously healthy children. Host factors involved in determining the outcome of influenza infection are unclear and children are known to be at higher risk of severe disease. First life exposure to influenza is also thought to dictate life-long immunity. Little is known about the effects of young age and gender on influenza responses and severity. This underscores the importance of understanding influenza pathogenesis in a pediatric population. Influenza pathogenesis is likely mediated in large part by exuberant inflammatory host responses in the lung. It is likely that predictive soluble inflammatory mediators are present in severe infection. Further, predictive biomarkers or mathematical models of influenza pneumonia severity would enhance clinical decision making and patient care. We propose that machine learning and mathematical modeling of host immune endpoints will define a molecular fingerprint of severe influenza pneumonia in juveniles. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims. Aim 1 will focus on characteristic molecular pathways related to influenza severity in juvenile animals, using outbred mice. We will utilize machine learning and new mathematical approaches for pathway and biomarker selection. Aim 2 will test mathematical models of influenza pathogenesis to elucidate new mechanisms that drive lung injury. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify novel biomarkers and mechanistic models of influenza pneumonia severity that can be applied to children. To accomplish this we will use a broad, exploratory, and unbiased approach. Candidate biomarkers and pathways would then be evaluated in future mechanistic and translational studies in mice and humans. NARRATIVE  Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide. There is a critical clinical need for biomarkers and models that predict influenza pneumonia severity in children. The goal of this study is to address this unmet need using an outbred mouse model of pediatric influenza pneumonia and well established mathematical approaches to inform future translational studies in children.",Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice,10143642,R21AI153882,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cytokine Receptors', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Seasons', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker selection', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disease phenotype', 'high risk', 'immunopathology', 'infection rate', 'influenza infection', 'influenza pneumonia', 'juvenile animal', 'lung injury', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,228212
"Experimentally guided modeling and simulation for cholera dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global pandemic at present. Quantitative research is urgently needed to clarify the impacts of the current vaccination campaign on the pandemic evolution and economic growth, and to guide future policy development. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new computational modeling framework for an investigation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US, and to incorporate real data to assess the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination on public health and the economy. To achieve this objective, the team will pursue three specific aims: (1) Modeling the transmission and spread of COVID-19 under the impact of vaccination; (2) Modeling the economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination; (3) Conducting a case study for the Chattanooga region in the state of Tennessee. The proposed research is significant because it will incorporate detailed characteristics and potential limitations of the current vaccination campaign (such as the vaccine efficacy, phased allocation schemes, public resistance to vaccination, and vaccine breakthrough due to new variants of SARS- CoV-2) into a sophisticated modeling framework, which will enable us to make more accurate forecasts on the progression and long-term evolution of the pandemic. As such, the project is expected to advance the current understanding of COVID-19 transmission and to quantify the interaction between epidemic spreading, economic growth, and disease prevention and intervention under the impact of COVID-19 vaccination, all of which are important for the control and management of the pandemic. The approach is innovative in the development of a computational framework that integrates novel mechanistic and machine learning models and that connects the epidemic and economic aspects of COVID-19. The innovation of this project is also reflected by the integration of sophisticated computational modeling, rigorous mathematical analysis, intensive numerical simulation, and detailed data validation. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration among an applied and computational mathematician with long-term interest in infectious disease modeling (Wang), an epidemiologist with extensive working experiences at CDC and a current member of the regional COVID-19 task force (Heath), a business and management professor with a background in public heath (Mullen), and a statistician with expertise in machine learning and biomedical data analytics (Ma). The success of this project will not only build a solid knowledge base for the complex transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 vaccination, but also provide important guidelines for the government agencies and public health administrations in pandemic management and policy development. Project Narrative The proposed project is relevant to public health because a deep understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and its health and economic impacts will help to inform the pandemic management and improve the current practice in disease prevention and intervention. The mathematical and machine learning models developed in this project will improve such understanding and make new knowledge discovery. This research effort aligns with part of NIH's mission to reduce public health burdens of infectious diseases.",Experimentally guided modeling and simulation for cholera dynamics,10376956,R15GM131315,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Attention', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 vaccination', 'Case Study', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Economic Factors', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Policy Developments', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Administration', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Route', 'SARS-CoV-2 transmission', 'SARS-CoV-2 variant', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Unemployment', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'computer framework', 'disorder prevention', 'dynamic system', 'economic impact', 'economic indicator', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health economics', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'professor', 'programs', 'simulation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'vaccine efficacy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE CHATTANOOGA,R15,2021,122580
