"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9847841,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2019,990318,-0.02882381440847371
"Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have diverse cellular components, including subcellular organelles and sub-organelle compartments. The accurate targeting of proteins to these cellular components is crucial in establishing and maintaining cellular organizations and functions. Mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. However, the vast majority of proteins lack subcellular/sub-organelle localization annotation. Compared with experimental methods, computational prediction of protein localization provides an efficient and effective way for proteome annotation and experimental design. The current prediction tools for protein localization have significant room for improvement. In addition, no tool can predict localization at the sub- organelle resolution or internal localization signals. Deep learning, as the cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new opportunity for this classical bioinformatics problem. The availability of recent high- throughput localization data can also train deep learning well. The PI’s lab has demonstrated some success on a special case, i.e., predicting mitochondrial localizations for plants using deep learning.  In this project, the PI proposes to develop new methods and a standalone toolkit for accurate and scalable protein localization prediction at the subcellular and sub-organelle levels, as well as for characterization of localization motifs (including novel internal motifs). The general approach is to design a semi-supervised deep- learning method that utilizes both annotated protein sequences with known localization and unannotated protein sequences as training data. Through the realization of an unsupervised deep-learning approach, a general representation of protein sequences will be implemented, characterizing both local and global features of protein sequences. By visualizing and characterizing the deep-learning models, novel, interpretable protein sequence patterns will be predicted as putative targeting peptides and compared with known localization signals. We will also use the methods to be developed and the unsupervised models to be trained on all protein sequences as a general framework for other sequence-based prediction problems that predict the label of a protein and the key residues contributing to the label. We will make the platform highly customizable and apply it to three applications, including ubiquitination protein prediction, enzyme EC number prediction, and protein family/subfamily classification. The innovative contributions to protein sequence-based analyses and predictions include: (1) using raw amino acid sequences as training inputs without feature engineering; (2) utilizing the huge amount of unannotated data in an unsupervised deep learning to characterize a general protein feature representation; (3) identifying potential targeting signals (especially internal motifs) by decoding the trained deep- learning models, augmented with sophisticated attention mechanisms; 4) detecting multiple-organelle targeting and sub-organelle localizations by a novel hierarchical multi-label architecture; and (5) combining features from different data sources by a multiplicative fused CNN model. Relevance to Public Health  A protein typically has a well-defined localization in a cell to perform its function, and mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. Protein localization prediction can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms and designing treatment. To address the limitations of current computational methods, this project will apply cutting-edge deep-learning methods to deliver new computational methods and tools with improved accuracy and detailed sub-organelle prediction for protein localization.",Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs,9768571,R21LM012790,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Experimental Designs', 'Generations', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'N-terminal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nobel Prize', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Plants', 'Protein Family', 'Protein translocation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2019,205330,-0.02649798805120254
"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT About 1500 of the ~20,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome can bind drug-like molecules, and yet only about 600 are currently targeted by FDA-approved drugs. Therefore, at least 930 proteins are potential drug targets that are not yet being utilized for human medicine and, given our incomplete state of knowledge about the human genome, the actual number could be much higher. There is therefore a substantial unmet need to improve our understanding of this so-called genomic dark matter in order to develop novel classes of drugs to improve treatment of disease. Comprehensive experimental investigation of these proteins in the context of hundreds of thousands of compounds and thousands of diseases would be prohibitively expensive, but computational approaches could significantly refine the list. In this project we will apply two sophisticated computational approaches to the task of predicting the most promising novel drug targets. We will integrate the knowledge bases DrugCentral and other resources with the disease and phenotype knowledge base of the Monarch Initiative into a semantically harmonized knowledge graph (KG). This will result in a KG with comprehensive coverage of diseases, genes, gene functions, phenotypic abnormalities, drugs, drug mechanisms, and drug targets. Machine learning (ML) identifies patterns from training sets and applies the patterns to predict entities and relations in new data. ML using KGs has become a hot new research area in computer science, but remains difficult to use for real-world applications, owing to the lack of adequate software packages. We will therefore implement state-of-the art learning algorithms based on deep learning on KGs by extending and adapting selected algorithms to the task of drug and drug target discovery. We will develop an easy-to-use software library and demonstrate its use by means of notebooks that will be designed to serve as starting points for future computational research by other scientists, since they will contain the analysis workflow along with documentation about each step. The human genome codes more than 500 protein kinases, which are enzymes that add a phosphate group to specific amino acid residues and thereby transmit a biological signal. There are currently 35 FDA approved protein kinase modulators acting on 38 protein kinases, which are thus one of the most important groups of druggable proteins encoded by our genome. We will perform a detailed computational study of this group and experimentally validate our top, novel candidate using a patient-derived xenograft model system. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The human genome codes for over 20,000 proteins, roughly 3,000 of which are thought to be “druggable”, meaning that in principle they could be targeted by medications to treat disease. However, only about 600 of these proteins are currently targeted by an approved medication, and our knowledge about most of the remaining proteins is limited. Our goal is to develop bioinformatic software that will combine information about these proteins, diseases, clinical manifestations, medications, and other relevant data into a network of information (i.e., a graph), and to use sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict novel drugs and drug targets. We will focus our computational strategy on the class of protein kinase inhibitors, which are a leading target for cancer drugs. The human genome encodes an estimated 555 kinases, 37 of which have been successfully targeted by anti-cancer medications. By using machine learning to predict which of the remaining 500+ protein kinases are most likely to be amenable to medical treatment, there is a potential to accelerate the pace of research into novel treatments. We will perform a pilot study of the top predicted candidates using a mouse model of cancer.",Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs,9742135,U01CA239108,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aloral', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enzymes', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'open source', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein kinase modulator', 'real world application', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NCI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U01,2019,588030,-0.019506087102037526
"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins. Reactome is the most comprehensive open source biological pathway knowledgebase.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9712954,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,459955,-0.01773997184553026
"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,9626635,R35GM130354,"['Antibody Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV vaccine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'drug discovery', 'immunogenic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein structure function', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2019,377124,-0.0434078972911956
"Systems-level functional proteomics analysis assemblies in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of tauopathy The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively map and identify the subnetworks of synaptic protein complexes that are central players in the synaptic dysfunction occurring with neurodegeneration. We will use the emerging power of quantitative network proteomics in the Emili laboratory to systematically characterize the major protein assemblies present at normal and diseased synapses on a proteome scale. This research will be propelled by discoveries from the Wolozin laboratory demonstrating that a dynamic network of protein interactions drives tau biology and changes with the course of disease. Interpreting these perturbed assembly networks, though, demands knowledge of the localization and compositional specificity of such complexes. The unbiased interactome screening technology developed by the Emili laboratory is uniquely suited for unbiased interrogations of synaptic protein networks. We hypothesize that selective disruption of specific synaptic protein assemblies mediates the functional degeneration associated with tauopathy. Aim 1 will determine how synaptic protein complexes differ between general cortical and cholinergic neurons. We will isolate and biochemical separate synaptic assemblies from total cortical and cholinergic (ChAT::GFP) synapses, using FACS to further purify ChAT:GFP synapses. Separated assemblies will be characterized by precision mass spectrometry and integrative data mining (machine learning) procedures to determine their composition and post- translational modification states, and to map dynamically changing interactions implicated in altered synaptic function during normal aging. Aim 2 will determine how the macromolecular structures of synaptic protein assemblies change with aging and AD. We will analyze cortical synaptosomal complexes from P301S tau and P301S tau x TIA1+/- mice, the latter which exhibited delayed degeneration. Key drivers in synaptic dysfunction will be identified and verified in AD and control human samples by co-immunoprecipitation.

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes,9933617,R01HD084628,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'druggable target', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'misfolded protein', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,626430,0.021524250259771623
"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å Cα-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9751901,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,369690,-0.010671288709172198
"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation. Our results are expected to help shape ongoing efforts aimed at targeting the farnesyl transferase for therapeutic benefit in a variety of diseases.",Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences,9887209,R01GM132606,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CENP-E protein', 'Charge', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Monitor', 'Nuclear Lamin', 'Online Systems', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Pheromone', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Farnesylation', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ursidae Family', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biophysical analysis', 'farnesylation', 'genetic selection', 'in vivo', 'isoprenylation', 'next generation sequencing', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'protein farnesyltransferase', 'protein function', 'protein geranylgeranyltransferase', 'protein protein interaction', 'ras-Related G-Proteins']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2019,405053,-0.018834731344224368
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9627995,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,393339,-0.00932823469157093
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing.

"Proteomics of ciliopathy protein complexes Summary Ciliopathies are a diverse class of developmental diseases that can manifest as defects in kidney, skeletal, eye, heart, reproductive, or mental function. Many ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl, Joubert, and Meckel Gruber Syndromes, are caused by defects in the major protein complexes that characterize the ciliary compartment. At least 1,000 proteins are associated with cilia biogenesis and function; uncovering the principles of ciliary protein organization thus requires a large scale, systematic investigation. Our current human protein complex maps, while extensive, have only moderate coverage of ciliary proteins, warranting the collection of targeted experimental datasets. I will use comparative proteomic analysis of cilia from multiple organisms to determine deeply conserved protein-protein interactions likely to be critical to ciliary function in humans. Examining human biological systems in the context of their level of conservation across species is a productive route to distinguish biological signal from noise. My preliminary data on three ciliated species confirm that this approach is capable of identifying conserved ciliary protein complexes. If a pair of proteins are found in physical contact in diverse species, having survived speciation events and gene loss, it can be predicted that this physical interaction is important. First, using mass spectrometry, we will experimentally detect protein complexes within the cilia across a spectrum of eukaryotic organisms, broadly defining conserved ciliary proteins. Second, we will integrate our own experimental data, some of which we have already collected, with outside data to construct a system-wide map of conserved ciliary protein complexes. These conserved ciliary protein complexes are strongly predicted to be functionally important in humans, and potentially involved in human birth defects. Finally, we will test a targeted subset of proteins predicted to associate with known birth defect proteins in vivo using Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. We have four candidate genes in hand, and will consider candidates from the prior aims as appropriate.

"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9647931,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2019,225875,-0.001329429854859976
"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,9610566,R01NS089435,"['AIDS dementia', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytokine Gene', 'Cytoplasm', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV tat Protein', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'National NeuroAids Tissue Consortium', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transactivation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chronic infection', 'diagnostic assay', 'extracellular', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'macrophage', 'molecular modeling', 'monocyte', 'nervous system development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroAIDS', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'non-demented', 'novel vaccines', 'peripheral blood', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tat Genes', 'tat Protein', 'transversion mutation', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,391250,-0.0011455680558941474
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9690777,R01GM120733,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene product', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2019,278100,-0.03197718599278252
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9625817,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,187702,0.011357090715365484
"Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have diverse cellular components, including subcellular organelles and sub-organelle compartments. The accurate targeting of proteins to these cellular components is crucial in establishing and maintaining cellular organizations and functions. Mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. However, the vast majority of proteins lack subcellular/sub-organelle localization annotation. Compared with experimental methods, computational prediction of protein localization provides an efficient and effective way for proteome annotation and experimental design. The current prediction tools for protein localization have significant room for improvement. In addition, no tool can predict localization at the sub- organelle resolution or internal localization signals. Deep learning, as the cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new opportunity for this classical bioinformatics problem. The availability of recent high- throughput localization data can also train deep learning well. The PI’s lab has demonstrated some success on a special case, i.e., predicting mitochondrial localizations for plants using deep learning.  In this project, the PI proposes to develop new methods and a standalone toolkit for accurate and scalable protein localization prediction at the subcellular and sub-organelle levels, as well as for characterization of localization motifs (including novel internal motifs). The general approach is to design a semi-supervised deep- learning method that utilizes both annotated protein sequences with known localization and unannotated protein sequences as training data. Through the realization of an unsupervised deep-learning approach, a general representation of protein sequences will be implemented, characterizing both local and global features of protein sequences. By visualizing and characterizing the deep-learning models, novel, interpretable protein sequence patterns will be predicted as putative targeting peptides and compared with known localization signals. We will also use the methods to be developed and the unsupervised models to be trained on all protein sequences as a general framework for other sequence-based prediction problems that predict the label of a protein and the key residues contributing to the label. We will make the platform highly customizable and apply it to three applications, including ubiquitination protein prediction, enzyme EC number prediction, and protein family/subfamily classification. The innovative contributions to protein sequence-based analyses and predictions include: (1) using raw amino acid sequences as training inputs without feature engineering; (2) utilizing the huge amount of unannotated data in an unsupervised deep learning to characterize a general protein feature representation; (3) identifying potential targeting signals (especially internal motifs) by decoding the trained deep- learning models, augmented with sophisticated attention mechanisms; 4) detecting multiple-organelle targeting and sub-organelle localizations by a novel hierarchical multi-label architecture; and (5) combining features from different data sources by a multiplicative fused CNN model. Relevance to Public Health  A protein typically has a well-defined localization in a cell to perform its function, and mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. Protein localization prediction can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms and designing treatment.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Probing Hidden Conformational Space and Dynamical States of Circadian Clock Proteins through Rigid Residue Scan and Machine Learning Protein dynamical distribution as ensemble in their phase space is directly linked to allostery. Some triggering events, such as binding process or chemical modification, could cause significant change of protein conformation as well as dynamics distribution. These led to two complementary allosteric models: conformation-driven and dynamics-driven allostery. Mutations of certain amino acid residues could alter distribution of protein conformation or dynamics, and regulate its allosteric function. This suggests that overall space for conformational and dynamical distribution potentially accessible for certain protein is much larger than those of specific structure, such as wild type. Certain perturbation including mutation could cause protein to dwell in additional (referred as hidden) conformational space or dynamical states. Therefore, directing proteins into these hidden states could serve as a novel approach in protein engineering. We propose to apply rigid residue scan method recently developed in our lab and machine learning models for data mining to systematically explore hidden conformational space and dynamical states of proteins with quantitative evaluations based on individual residue assessment. Our long-term goal is to exploit hidden conformational spaces and dynamical states of proteins and develop precise regulations of protein allostery and function. Two parallel and complementary specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis that many proteins have hidden conformational space and dynamical states inaccessible to the wild type but could be accessed through certain perturbation, and that additional space and states lead to precise allostery regulation or even new protein functions. In Aim 1, we propose to identify residues guiding conformational driven allostery to reach certain hidden conformational space for conformation driven allosteric circadian clock proteins. We will apply rigid residue scan method to efficiently sample hidden conformational space, and develop dimension deduction and Markov state model to theoretically describe protein conformational space. We will also apply machine learning and feature selection methods to develop classification model to quantitatively measure the conformation driven allostery. In Aim 2, we propose to identify residues of dynamics driven allosteric protein as keys to reach hidden dynamical states for dynamics driven allosteric circadian clock proteins. Similarly, we will apply rigid residue scan method to efficiently sample hidden dynamical space, and apply machine learning and feature selection methods to quantitatively measure the dynamics driven allostery. Mutants will be designed for the identified key residues in both aims. These mutants will be subjected to further molecular simulation for validation purpose. Only those computationally validated mutants will be subject to experimental test. We expect that the proposed research will lead to a novel theoretical model of protein allostery and provide computational tools to quantitatively predict the impacts on protein allostery from specific residue, which could benefit experimental study of the circadian clock proteins to design mutants as novel optogenetic tools. Narratives Protein allostery regulates protein functional activities by perturbation at a distant site. Allosteric modulation has become a novel approach to develop optogenetic tools to control biological processes. Here we propose to exploit hidden conformational spaces and dynamical states of proteins and develop precise regulations of protein allostery and function. Our efforts will lead to a novel theoretical model of protein allostery and provide computational tools to quantitatively predict the impacts on protein allostery from specific residue.

"Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning Project Summary/Abstract Allostery is action at a distance in proteins. It is a property by which perturbation at one site of a protein causes an effect at a distant site of the protein. As nature's biological switches allosteric proteins regulate virtually every major process including catalysis, transcription, transport and signaling. Kinases, G-protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors are therapeutically important allosteric proteins that play a major role in human health. Disruption of allosteric communication caused by mutations in these proteins is strongly associated with many types of disease abnormalities including cancer. Since the discovery of allostery in the 1960s, the molecular mechanism by which perturbation at one end of a protein is allosterically transmitted to the other end remains a mystery. Understanding molecular “rules” governing allostery is a fundamental problem in protein biochemistry and biophysics. Such rules may provide a deep insight into how proteins work through interactions between residues. Current approaches to studying allostery, which are biophysical, structural or computational, have two limitations. First, they provide an incomplete picture. Allostery involves the interplay of protein dynamics, structural changes and their effects on function. Probing each independently, as most studies do, does not give a complete understanding. Structure alone cannot explain dynamics, dynamical movement does not imply functional role, and functional studies may not provide insight into the underlying molecular causes. Second, detailed mechanistic studies of individual allosteric proteins while invaluable, are tedious, and cannot be scaled up to investigate many types of allosteric proteins. As a result, unifying heuristic rules would be difficult to infer from such individual case studies. The goal of my research is to develop a generalized, scalable method integrating structure, function and dynamics to understand, quantify and predict molecular drivers of protein allostery. With allosteric transcription factors as a model system, we will determine residues important for allostery (`hotspots') and their connectivity (`pathway') by deep mutational scanning, a method for large-scale functional characterization. We establish a critical link between structure and function by computationally modeling each mutation with Rosetta. We use machine learning on this rich sequence-structure-function dataset to recognize common molecular features (van der Waals, electrostatics, hydrogen bonds etc.) of allosteric hotspot residues, to build a predictive molecular model of allostery. Thus, we integrate high-throughput functional studies, structure-based modeling and machine learning to understand molecular rules governing allostery. Any allosteric protein whose activity can be coupled to a high-throughput screen, of which there are many, is amenable to our approach. Over time as the number and diversity of allosteric protein datasets increases, we expect that the accuracy and generalizability of predictions will continuously improve. Our long-term objective is to be able to (a) predict functional impact of thousands of mutations in disease-associated allosteric proteins revealed by genome sequencing (b) discover novel allosteric sites that improve selectivity and efficacy of drugs. Project Narrative GPCRs, nuclear receptors, ion channels and kinases are allosteric proteins that alone account for 44% of all human protein drug targets. We propose to develop a broad experimental and computational platform to understand molecular mechanism of allostery. This study will pave the way to explaining how dysfunction in allosteric proteins manifests into disease, and developing `smart' (allosteric) drugs that restore normal function.",Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning,9562195,DP2GM132682,"['Allosteric Site', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Case Study', 'Catalysis', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'drug efficacy', 'genome sequencing', 'heuristics', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular modeling', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'scale up', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,DP2,2018,2146877,-0.07062113231326855
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9421497,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'member', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,444578,-0.01773997184553026
"Quantitative Biotherapeutic Particle Characterization via Deep Neural Networks Project Summary  Despite their many beneﬁts and common use, protein-based drugs can elicit serious adverse side-effects. Many of these side-effects are believed to be caused by small protein aggregates. One tool for measuring these particles in a high-throughput fashion is Microﬂow-Imaging (MFI). MFI is commonly used in both academia and industry to characterize subvisible particles (those   25 m in size) in protein therapeutics. In many formulations protein aggregates that are   10 m in size account for upwards of 90% of the protein aggregates in the product. Subvisible protein aggregates have been demonstrated to correlate with adverse drug responses; however, which speciﬁc protein aggregates induce immunogenic responses remains unknown.  Pharmaceutical companies are required to record and catalog vast volumes of FIM data on protein therapeutic products, but are only mandated under FDA regulations (i.e., USP 788 ) to control the number of particles exceeding 10 and 25 m in delivered products. Hence a vast amount of digital images are available to analyze. Recent studies have indicated that some of the factors correlated with adverse drug responses are encoded in MFI image data.  Current state-of-the-art MFI analysis methods rely on a relatively low-dimensional list of “morphological fea- tures” to characterize particles, but these methods ignore an enormous amount of information encoded in the ex- isting large digital image repositories. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or “ConvNets”) have demon- strated the ability to extract predictive information from raw macroscopic image data without requiring the selection or speciﬁcation of “morphological features” in a variety of tasks. However, the heterogeneity, polydispersity of pro- tein therapeutics, and optical phenomena associated with subvisible MFI particle measurements introduce new challenges regarding the application of CNNs to MFI image analysis.  This proposal will spring from state-of-the-art deep CNN methods to provide new analysis tools capable of reliably analyzing and classifying heterogeneous MFI protein therapeutics data. The envisioned software product, capable of processing images from both of the leading manufacturers of MFI instruments (Fluid Imaging Inc. and ProteinSimple), will provide high-throughput, data-driven models that efﬁciently capture information encoded in the large collection of image data, avoiding the need to deﬁne “features” a priori and is anticipated to provide a paradigm shift to the MFI quantiﬁcation ﬁeld. We anticipate that the proposed algorithms and software will help in correlating which protein aggregates induce adverse side-effects and will also serve as a useful process monitoring tool. Project Narrative  Protein aggregates, found to some level in all commercial protein therapeutic based drugs, can be asso- ciated with a number of adverse responses in patients. In this project, new machine learning algorithms will be developed for analyzing large collections of biotherapeutics (protein therapeutic based drugs) measured via microﬂow-imaging (MFI) microscopy. Phase I will develop prototype software capable analyzing images of protein aggregrates in biotherapeutics measured via MFI for both process monitoring and identifying which characteris- tics of protein aggregates are correlated to high risk for causing adverse responses in patients.",Quantitative Biotherapeutic Particle Characterization via Deep Neural Networks,9619673,R41GM130513,"['Academia', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse reactions', 'Agitation', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Architecture', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Formulation', 'Freezing', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pump', 'Pythons', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic community technique', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'protein aggregate', 'prototype', 'repository', 'response', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R41,2018,222381,-0.009959170919081843
"Structure-based prediction of the interactome Supplement Summary “Structure-based prediction of the interactome” NIH R01GM081871-10 PI: Bonnie Berger We have designed and implemented a system for privacy-preserving and scalable sharing of drug-target interaction data (Aim 1, under review at Science), where we required GPUs to run our protocol, discover and experimentally validate novel drug-target interactions and will make our software publicly-available for academic and non-profit use (Aim 3). At the same time, we have presented a novel loss function for training classifiers from positive and unlabeled data and developed a software pipeline, Topaz, which uses convolutional neural networks trained with few positive examples for protein detection (Aim 2, RECOMB 2018). We are now developing new deep learning models for protein structure embedding and extending the Topaz framework to learn a general deep learning model of protein images from multiple cryo-EM micrograph datasets. Our continued progress on these projects is significantly jeopardized by our lack of GPU compute power. While in the last year we have purchased a compute node with four GPUs, we are continually frustrated by wait-times and inability to try different models and hyperparameters. Thus, we are requesting an additional node with eight GPUs to enable us to reach the broader goals of our grant. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,9505949,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'druggable target', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'misfolded protein', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2018,482654,0.021524250259771623
"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å C-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations.

"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9536053,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,369690,-0.010671288709172198
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9435146,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,393339,-0.00932823469157093
"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing.

"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9456316,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2018,232224,0.011357090715365484
"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,9405935,R01NS089435,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytokine Gene', 'Cytoplasm', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV tat Protein', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'National NeuroAids Tissue Consortium', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transactivation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chronic infection', 'diagnostic assay', 'extracellular', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'macrophage', 'molecular modeling', 'monocyte', 'nervous system development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroAIDS', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'non-demented', 'novel vaccines', 'peripheral blood', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tat Genes', 'tat Protein', 'transversion mutation', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,391250,-0.0011455680558941474
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains.

"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease.

"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å C-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,-0.00932823469157093
"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9381212,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Cereals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,439690,-0.010671288709172198
"Structural characterization of protein complexes involved in embryogenesis. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Birth defects, such as those effecting cardiovascular (e.g. Coarctation of the Aorta), nervous system (e.g. Spina bifida) and craniofacial development (e.g. Cleft Palate) are responsible for roughly 20% of infant deaths in the United States and place an exceeding burden on the health care system amounting to billions of dollars each year. Such defects are often the result of disruptions in embryogenesis, which depends on tight regulation of key pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PAR, and Bone morphogenetic peptide/TGF beta. Many of the protein complexes involved in these pathways however lack detailed molecular characterization, and more still remain to be discovered. Large-scale proteomics efforts focused on embryonic tissues are beginning to systematically identify proteins in vast numbers. Using these data, I propose to develop new methods to structurally and functionally characterize protein complexes associated with embryogenesis. Specifically, I will develop novel computational tools (i) to datamine for proximal interactions (i.e. protein subcomplexes) as well as (ii) to calculate protein stoichiometry. I will then integrate this information to build structural models capable of both characterizing individual complex functions as well as identifying their role in developmental failure. These results will provide a greatly needed mechanistic understanding of the protein complexes associated with embryogenesis and potentially uncover therapeutic targets to treat developmental failures. Moreover, the methods developed here will provide the capability to analyze virtually any biological system and thus should have broad implications for the study of many diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Failures during embryogenesis result in debilitating birth defects, which are responsible for roughly 20% of the US infant mortality rate and billions of dollars in health care costs.

"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS.

"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9315195,R01GM120733,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alpha Cell', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene product', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,278100,-0.03197718599278252

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,9131774,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2016,498328,0.021524250259771623
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,9059049,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'built environment', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate marker', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2016,423583,0.020172680659424718
"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions. Thus, the continued development of novel mass spectrometry technology is essential to understanding complex biological systems so that can be characterized that have a change in abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbation.",Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics,9060365,R01GM107142,"['Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'comparative', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,359848,0.06666930971865474
"Structural characterization of protein complexes involved in embryogenesis.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Birth defects, such as those effecting cardiovascular (e.g. Coarctation of the Aorta), nervous system (e.g. Spina bifida) and craniofacial development (e.g. Cleft Palate) are responsible for roughly 20% of infant deaths in the United States and place an exceeding burden on the health care system amounting to billions of dollars each year. Such defects are often the result of disruptions in embryogenesis, which depends on tight regulation of key pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PAR, and Bone morphogenetic peptide/TGF beta. Many of the protein complexes involved in these pathways however lack detailed molecular characterization, and more still remain to be discovered. Large-scale proteomics efforts focused on embryonic tissues are beginning to systematically identify proteins in vast numbers. Using these data, I propose to develop new methods to structurally and functionally characterize protein complexes associated with embryogenesis. Specifically, I will develop novel computational tools (i) to datamine for proximal interactions (i.e. protein subcomplexes) as well as (ii) to calculate protein stoichiometry. I will then integrate this information to build structural models capable of both characterizing individual complex functions as well as identifying their role in developmental failure. These results will provide a greatly needed mechanistic understanding of the protein complexes associated with embryogenesis and potentially uncover therapeutic targets to treat developmental failures. Moreover, the methods developed here will provide the capability to analyze virtually any biological system and thus should have broad implications for the study of many diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Failures during embryogenesis result in debilitating birth defects, which are responsible for roughly 20% of the US infant mortality rate and billions of dollars in health care costs.

"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,8996738,R01NS089435,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytokine Gene', 'Cytoplasm', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV tat Protein', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transactivation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'diagnostic assay', 'extracellular', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'macrophage', 'molecular modeling', 'monocyte', 'nervous system development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroAIDS', 'neuron loss', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'non-demented', 'novel vaccines', 'peripheral blood', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'tat Genes', 'tat Protein', 'transversion mutation', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,391250,-0.0011455680558941474

We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9029632,R01GM120733,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nucleic acid sequencing', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subcellular structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'feeding', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'research study', 'skills', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,278100,-0.03197718599278252
"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. (Not modified) We propose to develop novel and theoretically sound methodology for several important yet challenging problems in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, including the identification of peptides containing post- translational modifications and cross-linked peptides, and the absolute quantification of proteins in complex samples.",Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS,8902210,R01GM103725,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Indiana', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Synthetic Peptide Libraries', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'crosslink', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'model development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2015,411329,0.04183000969387314
"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1 The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.",Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome,8841004,R01MH094564,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Panic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Side Effects', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Thinking', 'Viral Cancer', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'body-mind', 'brain behavior', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychological', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,357427,-0.004318693793250869
"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.            ",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,8947210,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2015,513319,0.021524250259771623
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8847691,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2015,421696,0.020172680659424718
"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions. Thus, the continued development of novel mass spectrometry technology is essential to understanding complex biological systems so that can be characterized that have a change in abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbation.",Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics,8840976,R01GM107142,"['Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'comparative', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,374279,0.06666930971865474
"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the �2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant. G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.",Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors,8895982,R01GM095496,"['ADRB2 gene', 'Adrenergic Receptor', 'Behavior', 'Biophysics', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cell Signaling Process', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hydration status', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Opsin', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Activation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Water', 'Work', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'metarhodopsin I', 'metarhodopsin II', 'molecular dynamics', 'multi-scale modeling', 'network models', 'novel', 'protein structure', 'receptor function', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'supercomputer', 'temporal measurement', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2015,262650,-0.01678491366739919
"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved.

"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago. Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed. This new MS/MS dissociation method enables previously intractable peptide/protein classes to be sequenced and identified, have their sites of post-translational modification (PTM) mapped, and assess their abundances.

"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.                ",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,8924295,R01NS089435,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytokine Gene', 'Cytoplasm', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV tat Protein', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transactivation', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'diagnostic assay', 'extracellular', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'human CREB1 protein', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'macrophage', 'molecular modeling', 'monocyte', 'nervous system development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel vaccines', 'peripheral blood', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tat Genes', 'tat Protein', 'transversion mutation', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,391250,-0.0011455680558941474
"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""  Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation. that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles include transport of transforming growth factor-¿, and secretion of nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1¿ and IL-18. Exosomes may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post- synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.  miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion. Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate 80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.  Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.  Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80¿C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7 unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.  Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis. Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q- PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects. Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE   miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS,8842726,R21NS088138,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anterior', 'Astrocytes', 'Atrophic', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dysesthesias', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gulf War', 'HLA G antigen', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Integrins', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Ligand Binding', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipid Binding', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prions', 'Production', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rabies virus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Stress Tests', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'exhaustion', 'hemodynamics', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'presynaptic', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'response', 'sedentary', 'tau Proteins', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'white matter']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,155500,0.0075588360920443775
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules. It is the only IUBMB approved system for classifying transport proteins. Funding of this proposal will allow the maintenance and further development of TCDB, interlinking with related databases, expansion of machine learning approaches for information acquisition, and introduction of approaches for predicting the functions of uncharacterized proteins.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.            ",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8685758,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2014,419855,0.020172680659424718
"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Molecular Mechanisms of Telomere Length Homeostasis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomere integrity is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly, dysfunctional telomeres can initiate genomic instability, cellular senescence, and organismal aging. Telomere structure is provided by binding of shelterin to telomeric DNA repeats forming a nucleoprotein complex. Similar to the human shelterin, in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shelterin is composed of telomeric sequence-specific double-stranded and single-stranded DNA binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1, respectively, accompanied by their protein interaction partners, Rap1, Poz1, and Tpz1, which form a ""protein bridge"" connecting Taz1 and Pot1. Shelterin protects telomere integrity as well as regulates telomerase. With the parent grant support, we biochemically identified Tpz1 mutants that can individually but specifically disrupt its interactions with Poz1, Ccq1, or Pot1. Using these separation-of-function mutants of Tpz1, we found that the complete linkage between telomere dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins within the shelterin complex is required for defining the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres. Moreover, epistasis analyses revealed that Tpz1 also participates in the activation of telomeres to the extendible state via its interaction with Ccq1. Our results suggest critical regulatory roles of Tpz1 in the telomere ON/OFF binary switch. Here, we request supplemental funds to use emerging technologies and interdisciplinary teams to further advance our mechanistic understanding of shelterin to a new level.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins.

"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago.        Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed. This new MS/MS dissociation method enables previously intractable peptide/protein classes to be sequenced and identified, have their sites of post-translational modification (PTM) mapped, and assess their abundances. This is central to modern biology and has relevance for research ranging from human disease to evolution.

"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""   Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation.  that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of  short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs  (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The  exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that  bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other  target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and  miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles  include transport of transforming growth factor-ß, and secretion of  nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1ß and IL-18. Exosomes  may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to  transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post-  synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also  transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.   miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise  sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein  synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion.  Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression  of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment,  Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate  80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal  fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently  inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is  low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between  subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.   Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface  receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the  nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.   Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met  CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have  been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes  may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and  lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80°C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid  from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic  resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had  equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test  Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7  unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of  exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific  biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.   Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified  from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis  presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome  miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis.  Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of  origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.   SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-  PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after  exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects.  Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.   SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass  spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the  exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface  receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE  miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS,8752205,R21NS088138,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anterior', 'Astrocytes', 'Atrophic', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dysesthesias', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gulf War', 'HLA G antigen', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Integrins', 'Interleukin-18', 'Ligand Binding', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipid Binding', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prions', 'Production', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rabies virus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Stress Tests', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Testing', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'exhaustion', 'hemodynamics', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'response', 'sedentary', 'tau Proteins', 'white matter']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,272125,0.0075588360920443775
"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.       n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8679000,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,275230,-0.004814955907641648

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules. It is the only IUBMB approved system for classifying transport proteins. Funding of this proposal will allow the maintenance and further development of TCDB, interlinking with related databases, expansion of machine learning approaches for information acquisition, and introduction of approaches for predicting the functions of uncharacterized proteins.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions. Thus, the continued development of novel mass spectrometry technology is essential to understanding complex biological systems so that can be characterized that have a change in abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbation.            ",Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics,8558710,R01GM107142,"['Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'comparative', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,355930,0.06666930971865474
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins.

"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago.        Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed. This new MS/MS dissociation method enables previously intractable peptide/protein classes to be sequenced and identified, have their sites of post-translational modification (PTM) mapped, and assess their abundances. This is central to modern biology and has relevance for research ranging from human disease to evolution.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.       n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8470247,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,263721,-0.004814955907641648
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. (Not modified) We propose to develop novel and theoretically sound methodology for several important yet challenging problems in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, including the identification of peptides containing post- translational modifications and cross-linked peptides, and the absolute quantification of proteins in complex samples.",Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS,8373375,R01GM103725,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Indiana', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Synthetic Peptide Libraries', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'crosslink', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'model development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2012,448534,0.04183000969387314
"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today.

The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous progress has been made in computational protein design in the last 10 years. Though most work has focused on redesign of existing proteins to enhance their stability, specificity or new functionality, successful designs of novel protein folds (not naturally occurring) have emerged. However, to make protein design useful in practical applications, many challenges still exist in the design of protein-protein and protein- DNA interface and the design of dynamic properties of proteins, etc. To conquer those challenges, a practical solution is to develop more accurate scoring functions. It has been proved both experimentally and theoretically that intra and intermolecular signaling between distant sites within one or among many proteins plays a significant role in many biological processes, such as signal transmission and allosteric regulation, etc. The main research goal of this R21 grant is to develop new algorithms and strategies to incorporate the site-site couplings into a protein design procedure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we propose to study the site-site couplings and cooperative interactions of a protein or protein system using both the sequence-based and the physics-based approaches. Critical assessment of the existing approaches will be conducted and a novel algorithm will be developed using the residue-residue interaction energies. In Aim 2, the best methods for site-site couplings prediction will be tailored and integrated to physical scoring functions of protein design. To guarantee the success of this research grant, we propose four schemes to incorporate/combine the site-site coupling into a protein design procedure. The first two schemes represent simple combinations of sequence-based and physics-based protein design approaches; on the other hand, the next two schemes represent a more advanced integration of site-site correlations and physical scoring functions. In the last protocol, we propose to develop a novel scheme and software package to conduct protein design using the residue-residue interaction energies as a template. This approach, which is referred to as correlation embedding (CE), is based on a hypothesis that the correlation information is intrinsically encoded in the interaction energy matrix. The success of this sub-aim will have a great impact on rational protein design, as it represents a perfect integration of site-site couplings into a physical scoring function and opens a new avenue to conduct protein design. All the designed promising PDZ proteins will be synthesized and tested in both folding and functional assays.        Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings In this proposal, we intend to develop novel approaches to conquer the challenges in protein design. The new protein design strategies can facilitate us to engineer dynamical controls into a novel protein so that it can undertake a dynamic function. The novel approaches could be used to develop more effective biomedicine.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.        Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells. Our proposal is aimed at understanding the common strategies the bacteria use to recognize and deliver the secreted proteins to these specialized secretion systems. The results from our studies are likely to be valuable in the development of novel antimicrobials to treat common infections caused by these organisms.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport.

"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed. This new MS/MS dissociation method enables previously intractable peptide/protein classes to be sequenced and identified, have their sites of post-translational modification (PTM) mapped, and assess their abundances.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.       n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8325094,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,274204,-0.004814955907641648
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high- throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU).  The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches.  A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation.

"Building and Validating Location Proteomics Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to collect high-resolution information on the distribution of proteins within mammalian cells and to link it to nucleotide and protein sequences. It builds on extensive prior work on development of protein tagging methods by the co-PIs and on development of software systems for automated analysis of subcellular patterns in fluorescence microscope images by the PI. 25,000 independent cell lines expressing GFP protein fusions will be created in NIH 3T3 cells using high-throughput CD-tagging (protein-trapping) methods. As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images.

"Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous progress has been made in computational protein design in the last 10 years. Though most work has focused on redesign of existing proteins to enhance their stability, specificity or new functionality, successful designs of novel protein folds (not naturally occurring) have emerged. However, to make protein design useful in practical applications, many challenges still exist in the design of protein-protein and protein- DNA interface and the design of dynamic properties of proteins, etc. To conquer those challenges, a practical solution is to develop more accurate scoring functions. It has been proved both experimentally and theoretically that intra and intermolecular signaling between distant sites within one or among many proteins plays a significant role in many biological processes, such as signal transmission and allosteric regulation, etc. The main research goal of this R21 grant is to develop new algorithms and strategies to incorporate the site-site couplings into a protein design procedure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we propose to study the site-site couplings and cooperative interactions of a protein or protein system using both the sequence-based and the physics-based approaches. Critical assessment of the existing approaches will be conducted and a novel algorithm will be developed using the residue-residue interaction energies. In Aim 2, the best methods for site-site couplings prediction will be tailored and integrated to physical scoring functions of protein design. To guarantee the success of this research grant, we propose four schemes to incorporate/combine the site-site coupling into a protein design procedure. The first two schemes represent simple combinations of sequence-based and physics-based protein design approaches; on the other hand, the next two schemes represent a more advanced integration of site-site correlations and physical scoring functions. In the last protocol, we propose to develop a novel scheme and software package to conduct protein design using the residue-residue interaction energies as a template. This approach, which is referred to as correlation embedding (CE), is based on a hypothesis that the correlation information is intrinsically encoded in the interaction energy matrix. The success of this sub-aim will have a great impact on rational protein design, as it represents a perfect integration of site-site couplings into a physical scoring function and opens a new avenue to conduct protein design. All the designed promising PDZ proteins will be synthesized and tested in both folding and functional assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings In this proposal, we intend to develop novel approaches to conquer the challenges in protein design.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions.

To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors. This work will lead to the identification of a new catalog of virulence factors associated with establishment of Q fever, and provide novel targets for antimicrobial development              RELEVANCE STATEMENT The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The long term goal of the project is to understand the cellular mechanism of how neurons build the intricate dendritic and axonal branch structure that distinguishes them from other cell types. We will develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand how large families of proteins that sense and change the curvature of the plasma membrane synergistically control the neuronal architecture.             n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8192314,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,273713,-0.007903230562455447
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shotgun proteomics is one of the most commonly used approaches to MS-based biomarker discovery, due to its high throughput and sensitivity. The general strategy involves simultaneous protease digestion of all proteins in a mixture, liquid chromatography-based separation of peptides and analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to produce fragmentation spectra of each peptide. Each experimental spectrum is searched against a protein database. Sequences that best match the experimental spectra are considered identified, while a set of reliably identified peptides from the same protein is necessary for a reliable protein identification. The main goal in the proposed work is to generate and interrogate MS/MS data from several proteomics platforms, including ESI/MS, MALDI/TOF/TOF, LC-IMS/TOF and MALDI-PID/TOF to develop customized computational tools that address several challenging problems in shotgun proteomics data analysis: peptide identification, protein identification and label-free protein quantification. Our proposed approach is data-driven. At its core is the application of machine learning methods to the prediction of peptide fragmentation spectra as well as the likelihood of peptide detection in a typical proteomics experiment. Improved peptide identification coupled with the predicted peptide delectability will then be used to develop new methods for improved protein identification and quantification. The methods proposed herein will be extensively evaluated and software will be made public both as web-based tools and open-source deliverables. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions. Such studies might entail disease diagnosis (biomarker discovery), disease progression (tissue profiling), or effects of treatment (drug-induced proteome changes). These studies will enhance understanding of diseases and hasten the development of effective treatments and cures. In addition, these tools will be useful in characterizing new analytical tools for proteome analysis. Here we propose to develop and extensively evaluate computational methodology that will be used to improve the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions.

"Prediction of Protein Crystallization and Diffraction Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the key role that crystallography plays in structural biology, protein crystallization remains a significant bottleneck affecting a broad range of research programs. We developing a data-mining framework, PROSPERO, that can predict crystallization success and crystal diffraction quality based on characterization of specific protein properties available prior to large-scale crystallization trials. This will increase the efficiency and overall success rates of diffraction studies by individual research programs as well as by genome-scale projects. PROSPERO will perform a meta-analysis of many individual predictors based on statistical and machine-learning methods. A key feature of this framework is that it can dynamically re-estimate success/failure rates based on the current contents of the underlying database, and on the set of physical characterization data provided by individual users. The design will be modular, in that we will define a standard set of application interfaces (APIs) for supplying new categories of data to the core data storage, meta-analysis and prediction components. This will allow use of PROSPERO to be tailored to individual research programs, to target-specific physical properties, and to incorporate new physical characterization techniques. Our long-term goal is to grow a user community that will benefit from the continually improving predictions made by a central PROSPERO web server, that will contribute new input modules based on data produced by standard laboratory protocols and apparatus, and will also contribute to the population of the underlying database of results used for prediction.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-ray crystallography is a core technique in fundamental research programs that seek to understand disease mechanisms based on the three-dimensional structure of individual proteins, of large multi-protein complexes, and of larger assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids into key components of the cell.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7825413,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,R01,2010,273781,-0.008960637054628946

"Nonparametric Analysis of Reverse-Phase Protein Lysate Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play major roles as biological effectors and diagnostic markers. One level of its complexity is due to the post-translational modifications that cannot be detected at the genome level, which makes it desirable to measure proteins directly. Recently, some new protein microarray technologies have begun to bloom for this purpose. We focus on the reverse-phase protein lysate arrays that allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in many different cellular samples simultaneously. One advantage of this technology is that it requires a small amount of cells with just one antibody binding. However, it is more challenging to analyze protein lysate arrays than DNA arrays, and at the present time, the applications of protein lysate arrays are still in the exploratory stage with a lack of reliable statistical tools for quantifying the information (including the uncertainty) from protein arrays. We find that it is difficult, if at all possible, to model all the samples with a simple parametric family of response curves. We propose a robust approach to quantify the protein lysate arrays by fitting a monotone nonparametric response curve to all samples on the same array. The proposed method has been shown to fit the data more adaptively, avoiding bias due to parameterization. We aim to incorporate the modern shrinkage ideas in statistics into the nonparametric approach, leading to more stable quantification in time course experiments where the number of replicates is small at each time point. We also propose to use wild-bootstrap for assessing uncertainty of the protein concentration estimates and for assessing the influence of such uncertainties in follow-up analyses. When completed, our research will enable more reliable analysis of protein lysate arrays, and provide feedback to chip makers to improve the design of the protein microarrays, both of which are essential in making lysate arrays a useful tool in biological and medical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7906880,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2010,498935,0.024089320639331398
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"". The components proposed here constitute one crucial building block toward such a 4D map of a cell.          n/a",Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms,7924860,R01GM079767,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Transport', 'Biological databases', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cereals', 'Chloroplasts', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Internet', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Left', 'Locales', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Mitochondria', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Localization Signal', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein function', 'research study', 'software systems', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,312066,-0.0061516207122155895
"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,8112998,R01AI064913,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Descriptor', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Epitopes', 'Escape Mutant', 'Flavivirus', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Histamine Release', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immunotherapy', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Proteins', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computerized tools', 'env Gene Products', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'practical application', 'protein complex', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2010,252819,-0.01264635257669147
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7753228,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2010,98700,-0.02983950209902476
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data. Relevance: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.           n/a",Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra,7581004,R01EB007057,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Authorship', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Calibration', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Genomics', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Set protein', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Source Code', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'computer based statistical methods', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'expectation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mass spectrometer', 'model design', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2009,607717,0.05785971211472715
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7628516,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2009,329306,0.04981665493188402
"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shotgun proteomics is one of the most commonly used approaches to MS-based biomarker discovery, due to its high throughput and sensitivity. The general strategy involves simultaneous protease digestion of all proteins in a mixture, liquid chromatography-based separation of peptides and analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to produce fragmentation spectra of each peptide. Each experimental spectrum is searched against a protein database. Sequences that best match the experimental spectra are considered identified, while a set of reliably identified peptides from the same protein is necessary for a reliable protein identification. The main goal in the proposed work is to generate and interrogate MS/MS data from several proteomics platforms, including ESI/MS, MALDI/TOF/TOF, LC-IMS/TOF and MALDI-PID/TOF to develop customized computational tools that address several challenging problems in shotgun proteomics data analysis: peptide identification, protein identification and label-free protein quantification. Our proposed approach is data-driven. At its core is the application of machine learning methods to the prediction of peptide fragmentation spectra as well as the likelihood of peptide detection in a typical proteomics experiment. Improved peptide identification coupled with the predicted peptide delectability will then be used to develop new methods for improved protein identification and quantification. The methods proposed herein will be extensively evaluated and software will be made public both as web-based tools and open-source deliverables. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions. Such studies might entail disease diagnosis (biomarker discovery), disease progression (tissue profiling), or effects of treatment (drug-induced proteome changes). These studies will enhance understanding of diseases and hasten the development of effective treatments and cures. In addition, these tools will be useful in characterizing new analytical tools for proteome analysis. Here we propose to develop and extensively evaluate computational methodology that will be used to improve the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions.

"Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HYPOTHESIS: Central nervous system dysfunction is a central pathogenic mechanism in the CFS spectrum of illnesses. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a ""window"" into potential dysfunctional regulatory, innate immune, and neurological pathways. Neurons, glial cells, epithelial choroid plexus and leptomeningeal cells may be sources of CFS-related proteins. Despite the diverse clinical syndromes, the CFS-related proteome is the same, suggesting a unified pathogenesis. DATA: We have performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) on cerebrospinal fluid from CFS and healthy control subjects. Traditional and support vector machine (SVM) learning statistical analyses identified nearly identical CFS-related proteomes. A specific pattern of proteins (biosignature) predicted CFS with a significant odds ratio of 34.5 and concordance of 80%. Amyloidogenic proteins, antiproteases, Ig lambda, heme and Fe scavengers, and regulatory prohormones were associated with CFS. This is the first predictive model of CFS to be defined solely from objective data. PLAN: Recruit a new set of CFS and HC subjects (n=50 per group, ""cohort 4"") to a cross-sectional ""training-test"" study design. (A) Perform qualitative MS-MS to identify proteins in all samples of cohort 4. Train the SVM algorithm with cohort 4, then test the output ""classifier"" on an independent set of 42 samples (cohort 3). Determine the prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the SVM classifier. (B) Perform quantitative MS-MS on pooled CFS and pooled control samples by labeling one with O16 and the other with O18. Mix the samples and identify peptides (and their parent proteins) with O16/O18 ratios that are significantly higher or lower in CFS than controls. (C) These CFS-related proteins will be measured using novel, high sensitivity, luciferase- fusion protein competition immunoassays. Significant concentrations differences between CFS and control and between the 2 cohorts will define protein biomarkers and their sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy. (D) Subjective psychometric and other input variables will be tested by SVM learning to define a highly predictive model of CFS. The subjective results and objective proteomic results will also be analyzed to determine if the biomarkers are highly correlated with fatigue, systemic hyperalgesia, or other components of the CFS spectrum of illness. These methods and biomarkers may be of diagnostic value.

"Prediction of Protein Crystallization and Diffraction Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the key role that crystallography plays in structural biology, protein crystallization remains a significant bottleneck affecting a broad range of research programs. We developing a data-mining framework, PROSPERO, that can predict crystallization success and crystal diffraction quality based on characterization of specific protein properties available prior to large-scale crystallization trials. This will increase the efficiency and overall success rates of diffraction studies by individual research programs as well as by genome-scale projects. PROSPERO will perform a meta-analysis of many individual predictors based on statistical and machine-learning methods. A key feature of this framework is that it can dynamically re-estimate success/failure rates based on the current contents of the underlying database, and on the set of physical characterization data provided by individual users. The design will be modular, in that we will define a standard set of application interfaces (APIs) for supplying new categories of data to the core data storage, meta-analysis and prediction components. This will allow use of PROSPERO to be tailored to individual research programs, to target-specific physical properties, and to incorporate new physical characterization techniques. Our long-term goal is to grow a user community that will benefit from the continually improving predictions made by a central PROSPERO web server, that will contribute new input modules based on data produced by standard laboratory protocols and apparatus, and will also contribute to the population of the underlying database of results used for prediction.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-ray crystallography is a core technique in fundamental research programs that seek to understand disease mechanisms based on the three-dimensional structure of individual proteins, of large multi-protein complexes, and of larger assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids into key components of the cell.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed.

"Nonparametric Analysis of Reverse-Phase Protein Lysate Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play major roles as biological effectors and diagnostic markers. One level of its complexity is due to the post-translational modifications that cannot be detected at the genome level, which makes it desirable to measure proteins directly. Recently, some new protein microarray technologies have begun to bloom for this purpose. We focus on the reverse-phase protein lysate arrays that allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in many different cellular samples simultaneously. One advantage of this technology is that it requires a small amount of cells with just one antibody binding. However, it is more challenging to analyze protein lysate arrays than DNA arrays, and at the present time, the applications of protein lysate arrays are still in the exploratory stage with a lack of reliable statistical tools for quantifying the information (including the uncertainty) from protein arrays. We find that it is difficult, if at all possible, to model all the samples with a simple parametric family of response curves. We propose a robust approach to quantify the protein lysate arrays by fitting a monotone nonparametric response curve to all samples on the same array. The proposed method has been shown to fit the data more adaptively, avoiding bias due to parameterization. We aim to incorporate the modern shrinkage ideas in statistics into the nonparametric approach, leading to more stable quantification in time course experiments where the number of replicates is small at each time point. We also propose to use wild-bootstrap for assessing uncertainty of the protein concentration estimates and for assessing the influence of such uncertainties in follow-up analyses. When completed, our research will enable more reliable analysis of protein lysate arrays, and provide feedback to chip makers to improve the design of the protein microarrays, both of which are essential in making lysate arrays a useful tool in biological and medical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in the cell and mutations that disrupt these interactions result in many diseases.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun.

"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements.

"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data. Relevance: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.           n/a",Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra,7365198,R01EB007057,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Area', 'Authorship', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Calibration', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Genomics', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Set protein', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Source Code', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training', 'Work', 'computer based statistical methods', 'day', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'expectation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mass spectrometer', 'model design', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2008,602497,0.05785971211472715
"Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary purpose of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the means and structures for achieving two goals; (1) to develop intelligent computational aids for mining proteomic data accumulating from high throughput techniques like SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry; and (2) the long-term goal is to gain independence as a biomedical informatics researcher by developing methodological expertise in Bayesian methods and proteomic technologies. Applicant will obtain further instruction in probabilistic methods of data analysis; and she will receive education on proteomic technologies that are driving today's proteome research. Training will be provided through formal coursework, directed readings, seminars and conferences in addition to research directed by excellent mentors.  Applicant's research project involves a novel combination of techniques for use in proteomic data analysis. Previous research has included the use of techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks for analysis of proteomic data. These techniques were not explicitly designed to take into account background and prior knowledge. Hypothesis of this project is that background knowledge and machine learning techniques can positively influence the selection of appropriate biomarkers from proteomic data, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of massive datasets arising from proteomic profiling studies. Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,7460715,K25GM071951,"['Accounting', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Purpose', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrometry', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Today', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'data mining', 'design', 'heuristics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'symposium', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2008,132674,0.048799116368262486
"Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying residues of importance in the protein products of genes is a challenging and important problem for informatics, genome annotation, molecular biology, biochemistry and drug discovery. Functional annotation of genes is inherently hierarchical; genes can be annotated at the level of genome sequence, transcript variant, protein product, protein domain, nucleotide or amino acid. Only a few resources annotate protein function at the level of the amino acid and language relating residue function and gene product sequence, structure and expression is challenging. To address this, I am investigating how sequence, evolutionary and structural descriptors can be used to quantify function. I am applying this knowledge to develop methods that can associate residues with known functional annotations, perform annotation transfer onto an experimentally determined or modeled protein structure, and determine the likely molecular effects of mutation, thus creating a framework for residue annotation. One of the greatest challenges for the computational biologist is identifying features (or attributes) that are useful for classification of genomic data. With this effort, we will continue our work describing novel features for classification of functional sites and we will test them using supervised machine learning tools. We will do this by, 1) testing the power of several diverse functional features for classification of catalytic residues in proteins, 2) applying these features to other important residue functional annotation problems, and 3) evaluate features based on homologous sequences. This research is important for understanding the molecular basis of diseases such as cancer and pharmacogenetics data from a molecular perspective. When completed, scientists will have a rich set of data and tools for basic health research.             n/a",Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.,7391729,K22LM009135,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homologous Gene', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'paralogous gene', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'tool', 'web interface']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K22,2008,158143,-0.05255955905302424
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7431760,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Title', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2008,329296,0.04981665493188402
"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shotgun proteomics is one of the most commonly used approaches to MS-based biomarker discovery, due to its high throughput and sensitivity. The general strategy involves simultaneous protease digestion of all proteins in a mixture, liquid chromatography-based separation of peptides and analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to produce fragmentation spectra of each peptide. Each experimental spectrum is searched against a protein database. Sequences that best match the experimental spectra are considered identified, while a set of reliably identified peptides from the same protein is necessary for a reliable protein identification. The main goal in the proposed work is to generate and interrogate MS/MS data from several proteomics platforms, including ESI/MS, MALDI/TOF/TOF, LC-IMS/TOF and MALDI-PID/TOF to develop customized computational tools that address several challenging problems in shotgun proteomics data analysis: peptide identification, protein identification and label-free protein quantification. Our proposed approach is data-driven. At its core is the application of machine learning methods to the prediction of peptide fragmentation spectra as well as the likelihood of peptide detection in a typical proteomics experiment. Improved peptide identification coupled with the predicted peptide delectability will then be used to develop new methods for improved protein identification and quantification. The methods proposed herein will be extensively evaluated and software will be made public both as web-based tools and open-source deliverables. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions. Such studies might entail disease diagnosis (biomarker discovery), disease progression (tissue profiling), or effects of treatment (drug-induced proteome changes). These studies will enhance understanding of diseases and hasten the development of effective treatments and cures. In addition, these tools will be useful in characterizing new analytical tools for proteome analysis. Here we propose to develop and extensively evaluate computational methodology that will be used to improve the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions.

"Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HYPOTHESIS: Central nervous system dysfunction is a central pathogenic mechanism in the CFS spectrum of illnesses. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a ""window"" into potential dysfunctional regulatory, innate immune, and neurological pathways. Neurons, glial cells, epithelial choroid plexus and leptomeningeal cells may be sources of CFS-related proteins. Despite the diverse clinical syndromes, the CFS-related proteome is the same, suggesting a unified pathogenesis. DATA: We have performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) on cerebrospinal fluid from CFS and healthy control subjects. Traditional and support vector machine (SVM) learning statistical analyses identified nearly identical CFS-related proteomes. A specific pattern of proteins (biosignature) predicted CFS with a significant odds ratio of 34.5 and concordance of 80%. Amyloidogenic proteins, antiproteases, Ig lambda, heme and Fe scavengers, and regulatory prohormones were associated with CFS. This is the first predictive model of CFS to be defined solely from objective data. PLAN: Recruit a new set of CFS and HC subjects (n=50 per group, ""cohort 4"") to a cross-sectional ""training-test"" study design. (A) Perform qualitative MS-MS to identify proteins in all samples of cohort 4. Train the SVM algorithm with cohort 4, then test the output ""classifier"" on an independent set of 42 samples (cohort 3). Determine the prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the SVM classifier. (B) Perform quantitative MS-MS on pooled CFS and pooled control samples by labeling one with O16 and the other with O18. Mix the samples and identify peptides (and their parent proteins) with O16/O18 ratios that are significantly higher or lower in CFS than controls. (C) These CFS-related proteins will be measured using novel, high sensitivity, luciferase- fusion protein competition immunoassays. Significant concentrations differences between CFS and control and between the 2 cohorts will define protein biomarkers and their sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy. (D) Subjective psychometric and other input variables will be tested by SVM learning to define a highly predictive model of CFS. The subjective results and objective proteomic results will also be analyzed to determine if the biomarkers are highly correlated with fatigue, systemic hyperalgesia, or other components of the CFS spectrum of illness. These methods and biomarkers may be of diagnostic value. They will be useful for assessing longitudinal changes in disease severity, phenotype, or the effects of treatment.           n/a",Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,7447344,R01ES015382,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Albumins', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Epithelial', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Gulf War', 'Heme', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurohormones', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurons', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Persian Gulf', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychometrics', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Urea', 'cohort', 'healthy aging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prohormone', 'response', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment effect']",NIEHS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,366587,0.032825896474887095
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence- based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR¿). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns.

"Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are implicated in the development of numerous human diseases. Some of the natural substrates for ubiquitination and degradation can induce malignant transformation if not properly removed from the cell. Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          n/a",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7478711,R21CA113711,"['Acute Kidney Failure', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Generations', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Starvation', 'Structural Protein', 'SwissProt', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'human disease', 'improved', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'novel', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,168000,-0.013732417112731096
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7380093,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2008,280033,-0.008960637054628946

As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images. The ability to synthesize distributions will provide an important structural framework for systems biology modeling of cell behavior in normal and disease states.              n/a",Building and Validating Location Proteomics Databases,7446074,R01GM075205,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Behavior', 'Build-it', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Coin', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Analysis', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cellular imaging', 'computerized', 'fluorescence microscope', 'journal article', 'programs', 'protein distribution', 'software systems']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,259875,-0.0068014715179147795
"Accurate Protein Identification using Peptide Separation Information and Tandem M    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant problem currently hindering proteomics studies is the identification of peptides and proteins from mass spectral data. This problem is manifest in the difficulty to establish confidence limits of protein and peptide identifications. A serious concern is the tendency for the occurrence of false positive assignments. The development of an integrated protein identification platform will greatly reduce the risk of such assignments. This will allow Predictive Physiology and Medicine, Inc. (PPM) to produce unrivaled characterizations of the proteins in human plasma. With this capability, PPM will be able to perform the population studies necessary to create the protein profiles associated with health and disease, termed Addressable Digital Array Maps (ADAM). The ability to distinguish healthy and disease ADAMs will greatly enhance the competitiveness of PPM in the field of personalized medicine. Additionally, the platform itself will be marketable.       The integrated protein identification platform will be created using information that is generally discarded in typical liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (LC-MS). Algorithms will be developed aimed at predicting peptide separation profiles for two-dimensional (2D) ion mobility spectrometry (IMS, a technology currently only utilized by PPM for proteomics studies). The predicted profiles can be used to decrease protein database sizes which decrease the identity thresholds for assignments; effectively this increases the confidence of peptide assignments as well as increases the number of confident assignments. Additionally, algorithms will be developed to allow the use of multiple protein database search programs. A scoring scheme will be developed based on the union and intersection of resulting assignments. Finally, the algorithms and predictive capabilities will be combined in a single integrated system to determine an accurate p-value for protein assignments which are entered into the ADAMs.The development of the integrated protein identification platform will have a substantial impact on the field of personalized medicine. Such a platform will enable the development of unprecedented plasma protein databases that can be used to determine the disease susceptibility and therapeutic response of different individuals.          n/a",Accurate Protein Identification using Peptide Separation Information and Tandem M,7405508,R41RR024306,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Numbers', 'Peptides', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phosphorylation', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population Study', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Preventive', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Set protein', 'Simulate', 'Solid', 'Spectrometry', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'digital', 'glycosylation', 'innovation', 'ion mobility', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mathematical model', 'millisecond', 'practical application', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'software development', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCRR,"PREDICTIVE PHYSIOLOGY AND MEDICINE, INC.",R41,2008,149711,0.0064717070141929985
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7622959,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'research study', 'response', 'software development', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2008,536748,0.024089320639331398
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"". The components proposed here constitute one crucial building block toward such a 4D map of a cell.          n/a",Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms,7500843,R01GM079767,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Transport', 'Biological databases', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cereals', 'Chloroplasts', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Binding', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Internet', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Left', 'Locales', 'Localized', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Mitochondria', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Localization Signal', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Today', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein function', 'research study', 'software systems', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,318063,-0.0061516207122155895
"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,7346975,R01AI064913,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Descriptor', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Endopeptidases', 'Epitopes', 'Escape Mutant', 'Flavivirus', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Histamine Release', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immunotherapy', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Proteins', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computerized tools', 'env Gene Products', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'practical application', 'protein structure', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R01,2008,280910,-0.01264635257669147
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data. Relevance: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.           n/a",Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra,7194479,R01EB007057,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Area', 'Authorship', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Calibration', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Genomics', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Set protein', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Source Code', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training', 'Work', 'computer based statistical methods', 'day', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'expectation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mass spectrometer', 'model design', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2007,623873,0.05785971211472715
"Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary purpose of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the means and structures for achieving two goals; (1) to develop intelligent computational aids for mining proteomic data accumulating from high throughput techniques like SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry; and (2) the long-term goal is to gain independence as a biomedical informatics researcher by developing methodological expertise in Bayesian methods and proteomic technologies. Applicant will obtain further instruction in probabilistic methods of data analysis; and she will receive education on proteomic technologies that are driving today's proteome research. Training will be provided through formal coursework, directed readings, seminars and conferences in addition to research directed by excellent mentors.  Applicant's research project involves a novel combination of techniques for use in proteomic data analysis. Previous research has included the use of techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks for analysis of proteomic data. These techniques were not explicitly designed to take into account background and prior knowledge. Hypothesis of this project is that background knowledge and machine learning techniques can positively influence the selection of appropriate biomarkers from proteomic data, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of massive datasets arising from proteomic profiling studies. Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,7254755,K25GM071951,"['Accounting', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Purpose', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrometry', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Today', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'data mining', 'design', 'heuristics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'symposium', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2007,130068,0.048799116368262486
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,7237368,R01LM007994,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Information Resources', 'International', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Kindling (Neurology)', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Score', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,264180,-0.05032414035248783
"Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying residues of importance in the protein products of genes is a challenging and important problem for informatics, genome annotation, molecular biology, biochemistry and drug discovery. Functional annotation of genes is inherently hierarchical; genes can be annotated at the level of genome sequence, transcript variant, protein product, protein domain, nucleotide or amino acid. Only a few resources annotate protein function at the level of the amino acid and language relating residue function and gene product sequence, structure and expression is challenging. To address this, I am investigating how sequence, evolutionary and structural descriptors can be used to quantify function. I am applying this knowledge to develop methods that can associate residues with known functional annotations, perform annotation transfer onto an experimentally determined or modeled protein structure, and determine the likely molecular effects of mutation, thus creating a framework for residue annotation. One of the greatest challenges for the computational biologist is identifying features (or attributes) that are useful for classification of genomic data. With this effort, we will continue our work describing novel features for classification of functional sites and we will test them using supervised machine learning tools. We will do this by, 1) testing the power of several diverse functional features for classification of catalytic residues in proteins, 2) applying these features to other important residue functional annotation problems, and 3) evaluate features based on homologous sequences. This research is important for understanding the molecular basis of diseases such as cancer and pharmacogenetics data from a molecular perspective.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7239477,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Title', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2007,318904,0.04981665493188402
"Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HYPOTHESIS: Central nervous system dysfunction is a central pathogenic mechanism in the CFS spectrum of illnesses. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a ""window"" into potential dysfunctional regulatory, innate immune, and neurological pathways. Neurons, glial cells, epithelial choroid plexus and leptomeningeal cells may be sources of CFS-related proteins. Despite the diverse clinical syndromes, the CFS-related proteome is the same, suggesting a unified pathogenesis. DATA: We have performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) on cerebrospinal fluid from CFS and healthy control subjects. Traditional and support vector machine (SVM) learning statistical analyses identified nearly identical CFS-related proteomes. A specific pattern of proteins (biosignature) predicted CFS with a significant odds ratio of 34.5 and concordance of 80%. Amyloidogenic proteins, antiproteases, Ig lambda, heme and Fe scavengers, and regulatory prohormones were associated with CFS. This is the first predictive model of CFS to be defined solely from objective data. PLAN: Recruit a new set of CFS and HC subjects (n=50 per group, ""cohort 4"") to a cross-sectional ""training-test"" study design. (A) Perform qualitative MS-MS to identify proteins in all samples of cohort 4.

"Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HYPOTHESIS: Central nervous system dysfunction is a central pathogenic mechanism in the CFS spectrum of illnesses. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a ""window"" into potential dysfunctional regulatory, innate immune, and neurological pathways. Neurons, glial cells, epithelial choroid plexus and leptomeningeal cells may be sources of CFS-related proteins. Despite the diverse clinical syndromes, the CFS-related proteome is the same, suggesting a unified pathogenesis. DATA: We have performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) on cerebrospinal fluid from CFS and healthy control subjects. Traditional and support vector machine (SVM) learning statistical analyses identified nearly identical CFS-related proteomes. A specific pattern of proteins (biosignature) predicted CFS with a significant odds ratio of 34.5 and concordance of 80%. Amyloidogenic proteins, antiproteases, Ig lambda, heme and Fe scavengers, and regulatory prohormones were associated with CFS. This is the first predictive model of CFS to be defined solely from objective data. PLAN: Recruit a new set of CFS and HC subjects (n=50 per group, ""cohort 4"") to a cross-sectional ""training-test"" study design. (A) Perform qualitative MS-MS to identify proteins in all samples of cohort 4. Train the SVM algorithm with cohort 4, then test the output ""classifier"" on an independent set of 42 samples (cohort 3).

"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns. Thus, the novel design concept of ""drug inhibitor as a wrapper of functional packing defects"" will be explored and validated. n/a",Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets,7282361,R01GM072614,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electrostatics', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'SwissProt', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Water', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'repository', 'size', 'stem', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,284461,-0.034438336079460966
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7268219,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2007,288025,-0.008960637054628946
"Computational methods for the analysis of protein flexibility.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein flexibility, manifested by local and global changes in conformation, is an essential component of protein function. Conformational flexibility is involved in fundamental biological activities, such as intermolecular interactions, and in a variety of human diseases, such as transmissible encephalopathies and synucleinopathies. Our long-term goal is to incorporate the dynamic properties of proteins into computational analyses of functional sites and disease-related conformational transitions. However, progress in the important area of protein flexibility has long been hampered by the absence of reliable and efficient computational methodology that could be used to perform systematic large-scale studies of flexible protein segments. The main goal of this proposal is to circumvent this problem by developing accurate high-throughput computational methods for predicting dynamic properties of protein segments using their sequence properties. Protein flexibility can be classified into two broad categories: (1) disordered flexibility observed in disordered segments that completely lack detectable structure and (2) ordered flexibility observed in segments that undergo conformational transition from one detectable ordered structure to another. We will address the least studied category of ordered flexibility. First, we will use a combination of supervised pattern-recognition and statistical methods to develop high-throughput methodology that can be used to quantify and predict ordered conformational flexibility from local sequence and has a low rate of false positive predictions. Second, we will create an independent test set of proteins that can be used to assess   the performance of computational methods designed for the analysis of conformational changes in proteins. Computational methodology developed as an outcome of this proposal will facilitate progress in many areas of basic and applied protein research directly related to human health, including protein structure modeling, studies of protein functional sites and a variety of protein flexibility-related human diseases.         n/a",Computational methods for the analysis of protein flexibility.,7211431,R03LM009034,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Encephalopathies', 'Environment', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pliability', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Set protein', 'Site', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'conformational conversion', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intermolecular interaction', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'statistics', 'text searching']",NLM,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R03,2007,69594,-0.06580044734404474
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,7176188,R01AI064913,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Descriptor', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Endopeptidases', 'Epitopes', 'Escape Mutant', 'Flavivirus', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Histamine Release', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immunotherapy', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Proteins', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computerized tools', 'env Gene Products', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'practical application', 'protein structure', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R01,2007,286350,-0.01264635257669147
"2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Large, integrin-binding proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, and thrombospondin are integral parts of established matrices and are generally discussed at other GRC meetings. Smaller integrin-binding proteins perform many functions other than those of structural scaffolding. One class of small, integrin-binding proteins encoded by five genes clustered on human chromosome 4 are called the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein) family. Members include bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, and osteopontin. Normally expressed by skeletal tissue, SIBLINGs are thought to play a role in mineralization as well as cellular adhesion and migration. Specific SIBLINGs are also induced in a number of different cancer types including breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and thyroid cancers. Individual SIBLING family members have been found to promote angiogenesis and invasiveness. A second small integrinbinding gene family is the connective tissue growth factor/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma overexpressed (CCN) family of proteins. Members of the CNN family contain a conserved insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein motif and are secreted extracellular matrix proteins. CCNs are involved in diverse biological processes such as regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. They play important roles in pregnancy, development, angiogenesis, wound repair and inflammation. Certain CCN genes appear to act as tumor-promoting factors, while other CCNs exhibits suppressive capabilities. The focus of this Gordon Research Conference is on defining state-of-the-art knowledge of the biological activities, biochemical interactions and physiological consequences of small-integrin binding proteins in normal and pathological states. This application has as its specific aims to: (1) Convene an international group of experts on SIBLING and CCN biology; (2) Through multidisciplinary presentations determine the state of the art knowledge on small integrin binding proteins in normal physiological function and cancer pathology; (3) Facilitate cross-fertilization of multiple fields (biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, oncology, inflammation, the SIBLING and CCN fields); and (4) spark translational opportunities in the development of novel ways to use SIBLINGs/CCNs as markers for pathological states and discuss therapeutic applications. These aims are directly relevant to the mission of the NIH. The format follows the standard template for a Gordon Research Conference, with an evening introductory evening session, followed by 4 days of morning sessions, late afternoon poster sessions and evening talks in an environment facilitating the open, unhampered discussion of ideas at the frontiers of science. The principal topics to be addressed are: intracellular processing and function of SIBLINGs/CCNs; genetic regulation of SIBLING and CCN genes; SIBLINGs and CCNs in cancer and inflammation; and bioactive fragments of SIBLINGs/CCNs.              n/a",2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference,7329283,R13HL090059,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Arts', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Class', 'Collagen', 'Colon', 'Cysteine', 'DSPP gene', 'Dentin', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fertilization', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Genus Cola', 'Glycoproteins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth-Factor-Binding Proteins', 'Integrin Binding', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Mission', 'Molecular Biology', 'NOV gene', 'Nephroblastoma', 'Numbers', 'Pancreas', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Siblings', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wound Healing', 'angiogenesis', 'bone sialoprotein', 'cancer type', 'connective tissue growth factor', 'day', 'frontier', 'member', 'migration', 'mineralization', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oncology', 'osteopontin', 'posters', 'scaffold', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NHLBI,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2007,5000,-0.015440521774618854
"Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are implicated in the development of numerous human diseases. Some of the natural substrates for ubiquitination and degradation can induce malignant transformation if not properly removed from the cell. Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          n/a",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7256169,R21CA113711,[' '],NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,188000,-0.013732417112731096
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification.

"Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of our research are: (a) to develop more sensitive and reliable methods for exploiting sequence and structure information through similarity searching; and (b) to understand better the biophysical constraints on protein folding that can be identified from protein sequence information. Although similarity searching is now routinely used to characterize sequences and annotate genomes, the most widely used methods focus on speed at the expense of sensitivity and statistical accuracy. We believe that more flexible algorithms, with more accurate statistical estimates, can provide new biological insights about the structure, function, and evolutionary history of protein and DMA sequences. Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To improve the FASTA programs by: providing better performance on parallel (Beowulf) clusters; using vector-parallel instruction sets, and providing more accurate statistics. (2) To develop evolutionary calibrated DMA sequence comparison algorithms using rapid initial seeding, followed by extension using context dependent scoring matrices. The goal is to develop heuristic approaches with well understood evolutionary horizons. (3) To develop improved strategies for identifying repeated sequences in proteins by combining optimal local alignment strategies with appropriate scoring matrices and gap penalties, (4) To develop accurate statistical estimates for profile: sequence and profile: profile similarity searches. Profile: profile comparison programs with accurate statistical estimates should substantially reduce the sensitivity gap between sequence and structure comparison. Profile: profile comparisons will both be far more useful, and allow us to explore fundamental questions about how easy it is for new protein families to emerge. (5) We will examine local sequence constraints in proteins, using each family as an independent observation. We believe that much of the literature on the global properties of protein sequences fails to distinguish between correlations that reflect genuine biophysical constraints, and correlations that reflect shared evolutionary history. We will also search for clear examples of convergent evolution-similar functions carried out by clearly non-homologous proteins. Accurate statistical estimates for searches with real protein sequences, and profiles from real protein families, can change fundamentally the inference of homology from statistically significant similarity. Because of inaccurate statistical estimates, similarity searching is often considered a tool for generating hypotheses about homology, which must be confirmed experimentally. When the statistical estimates are highly accurate, it may become possible to define homology in terms of statistically significant similarity.           n/a",Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures,7096765,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'chemical information system', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2006,333081,-0.06285077931002041

Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level.

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,7012338,R01AI064913,"['B lymphocyte', 'T lymphocyte', 'allergens', 'aminoacid', 'antigens', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'chemical property', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dengue virus', 'immunoglobulin E', 'major histocompatibility complex', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'peptides', 'physical property', 'protein binding', 'stereochemistry', 'structural biology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R01,2006,258041,-0.01264635257669147
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,7050072,R01LM007994,"['Internet', 'classification', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular probes', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein purification', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2006,272070,-0.05032414035248783

Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,7089794,K25GM071951,"['bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'human data', 'mass spectrometry', 'proteomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2006,127449,0.048799116368262486
"Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HYPOTHESIS: Central nervous system dysfunction is a central pathogenic mechanism in the CFS spectrum of illnesses. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a ""window"" into potential dysfunctional regulatory, innate immune, and neurological pathways. Neurons, glial cells, epithelial choroid plexus and leptomeningeal cells may be sources of CFS-related proteins. Despite the diverse clinical syndromes, the CFS-related proteome is the same, suggesting a unified pathogenesis. DATA: We have performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) on cerebrospinal fluid from CFS and healthy control subjects. Traditional and support vector machine (SVM) learning statistical analyses identified nearly identical CFS-related proteomes. A specific pattern of proteins (biosignature) predicted CFS with a significant odds ratio of 34.5 and concordance of 80%. Amyloidogenic proteins, antiproteases, Ig lambda, heme and Fe scavengers, and regulatory prohormones were associated with CFS. This is the first predictive model of CFS to be defined solely from objective data. PLAN: Recruit a new set of CFS and HC subjects (n=50 per group, ""cohort 4"") to a cross-sectional ""training-test"" study design. (A) Perform qualitative MS-MS to identify proteins in all samples of cohort 4. Train the SVM algorithm with cohort 4, then test the output ""classifier"" on an independent set of 42 samples (cohort 3). Determine the prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the SVM classifier. (B) Perform quantitative MS-MS on pooled CFS and pooled control samples by labeling one with O16 and the other with O18. Mix the samples and identify peptides (and their parent proteins) with O16/O18 ratios that are significantly higher or lower in CFS than controls. (C) These CFS-related proteins will be measured using novel, high sensitivity, luciferase- fusion protein competition immunoassays. Significant concentrations differences between CFS and control and between the 2 cohorts will define protein biomarkers and their sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy. (D) Subjective psychometric and other input variables will be tested by SVM learning to define a highly predictive model of CFS. The subjective results and objective proteomic results will also be analyzed to determine if the biomarkers are highly correlated with fatigue, systemic hyperalgesia, or other components of the CFS spectrum of illness. These methods and biomarkers may be of diagnostic value. They will be useful for assessing longitudinal changes in disease severity, phenotype, or the effects of treatment.           n/a",Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,7125660,R01ES015382,"['bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'blood brain barrier', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'clinical research', 'fibromyalgia', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'liquid chromatography', 'mass spectrometry', 'protein quantitation /detection', 'proteomics', 'questionnaires', 'radiotracer']",NIEHS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,379720,0.032825896474887095
"Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying residues of importance in the protein products of genes is a challenging and important problem for informatics, genome annotation, molecular biology, biochemistry and drug discovery. Functional annotation of genes is inherently hierarchical; genes can be annotated at the level of genome sequence, transcript variant, protein product, protein domain, nucleotide or amino acid. Only a few resources annotate protein function at the level of the amino acid and language relating residue function and gene product sequence, structure and expression is challenging. To address this, I am investigating how sequence, evolutionary and structural descriptors can be used to quantify function. I am applying this knowledge to develop methods that can associate residues with known functional annotations, perform annotation transfer onto an experimentally determined or modeled protein structure, and determine the likely molecular effects of mutation, thus creating a framework for residue annotation. One of the greatest challenges for the computational biologist is identifying features (or attributes) that are useful for classification of genomic data. With this effort, we will continue our work describing novel features for classification of functional sites and we will test them using supervised machine learning tools. We will do this by, 1) testing the power of several diverse functional features for classification of catalytic residues in proteins, 2) applying these features to other important residue functional annotation problems, and 3) evaluate features based on homologous sequences. This research is important for understanding the molecular basis of diseases such as cancer and pharmacogenetics data from a molecular perspective.

"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns.

"A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the increased awareness for Bio-defense and the possibility of the spread of new emerging infectious pathogens, I propose to investigate the feasibility of predicting amino acid contacts for the three proteins of the replication/transcription complex of the order Mononegavirales (e.g. Ebola, Rabies, measles etc.). The large size of the replication/transcription complex is beyond the limits of current structural determination methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy; therefore, an approach that correlates results from both laboratory and Bio-informatic analyses is a logical course of action. The proposed Bio-informatic studies will proceed along three paths: prediction of disorder; determination of compensatory mutation; and assessment of evolutionary dynamics. Correlating the data obtained from these methods and experimental data from the published literature will maximize the chances of identifying the protein: protein contact points both within and between the P, N, and L proteins of the replication/transcription complex. However, this poses the challenge of integrating the findings from the different methods in a meaningful and comprehensive way. A traditional joint probability distribution approach would require a space of O(2^n) to represent the data, with n being the number of data sets. Given the vast amount of information to be incorporated, this method is beyond current computational feasibility. Instead, a method from the field of artificial intelligence, Bayesian Networks (also known as Belief Networks) will be utilized to correlate the results.

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,6916795,R01AI064913,"['B lymphocyte', 'T lymphocyte', 'allergens', 'aminoacid', 'antigens', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'chemical property', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dengue virus', 'immunoglobulin E', 'major histocompatibility complex', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'peptides', 'physical property', 'protein binding', 'stereochemistry', 'structural biology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R01,2005,264250,-0.01264635257669147
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,6890047,R01LM007994,"['Internet', 'classification', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular probes', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein purification', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2005,278617,-0.05032414035248783
"Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary purpose of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the means and structures for achieving two goals; (1) to develop intelligent computational aids for mining proteomic data accumulating from high throughput techniques like SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry; and (2) the long-term goal is to gain independence as a biomedical informatics researcher by developing methodological expertise in Bayesian methods and proteomic technologies. Applicant will obtain further instruction in probabilistic methods of data analysis; and she will receive education on proteomic technologies that are driving today's proteome research. Training will be provided through formal coursework, directed readings, seminars and conferences in addition to research directed by excellent mentors.  Applicant's research project involves a novel combination of techniques for use in proteomic data analysis. Previous research has included the use of techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks for analysis of proteomic data. These techniques were not explicitly designed to take into account background and prior knowledge. Hypothesis of this project is that background knowledge and machine learning techniques can positively influence the selection of appropriate biomarkers from proteomic data, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of massive datasets arising from proteomic profiling studies. Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,6915489,K25GM071951,"['bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'human data', 'mass spectrometry', 'proteomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2005,123942,0.048799116368262486
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells. Experience gained in the course of these studies will be used to direct and refine hardware and software development.           n/a",FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY,6846631,R01GM060678,"['Urodela', 'Xenopus', 'animal tissue', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'centromere', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent dye /probe', 'image enhancement', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'small interfering RNA', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2005,451020,-0.0016456936678500291
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns. Thus, the novel design concept of ""drug inhibitor as a wrapper of functional packing defects"" will be explored and validated. n/a",Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets,6965896,R01GM072614,"['aminoacid', 'amyloid proteins', 'bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'chemical genetics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'hydrogen bond', 'information systems', 'method development', 'pharmacogenetics', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'proteomics']",NIGMS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,309178,-0.034438336079460966
"A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the increased awareness for Bio-defense and the possibility of the spread of new emerging infectious pathogens, I propose to investigate the feasibility of predicting amino acid contacts for the three proteins of the replication/transcription complex of the order Mononegavirales (e.g. Ebola, Rabies, measles etc.). The large size of the replication/transcription complex is beyond the limits of current structural determination methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy; therefore, an approach that correlates results from both laboratory and Bio-informatic analyses is a logical course of action. The proposed Bio-informatic studies will proceed along three paths: prediction of disorder; determination of compensatory mutation; and assessment of evolutionary dynamics. Correlating the data obtained from these methods and experimental data from the published literature will maximize the chances of identifying the protein: protein contact points both within and between the P, N, and L proteins of the replication/transcription complex. However, this poses the challenge of integrating the findings from the different methods in a meaningful and comprehensive way. A traditional joint probability distribution approach would require a space of O(2^n) to represent the data, with n being the number of data sets. Given the vast amount of information to be incorporated, this method is beyond current computational feasibility. Instead, a method from the field of artificial intelligence, Bayesian Networks (also known as Belief Networks) will be utilized to correlate the results. Several experimental laboratories have agreed to test the residue contact predictions resulting from these studies for Ebola, VSV and measles. n/a",A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts,6814915,R21AI063510,"['Mononegavirales', 'artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'bioinformatics', 'biotechnology', 'computational biology', 'gene mutation', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein sequence', 'proteomics', 'virus protein']",NIAID,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY (BOZEMAN),R21,2004,203950,-0.033259802891515394
"COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                                                                                                                  The long-term goal of our research is the development of better methods for          identifying distantly related protein and DNA sequences, and to exploit our          ability to detect distant homologies to explore the duplication, fusion, and         other processes responsible for increases in protein diversity.  Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.  Over the next 2-4 years, more       than six genomes that have diverged in the last 400 million years - an               evolutionary distance sufficiently short that we should be able to identify          all protein homologs - will become available.  We will compare complete              genomes searching for newly emergent sequences.  (5) We will develop and             characterize unified methods for the simultaneous construction of alignments         and phylogenies over multiple sequences.  We will also develop standalone            tree-based alignment heuristics capable of rapidly aligning large numbers of         sequences.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES,6746918,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'chemical information system', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2004,364198,-0.04648866017729025
"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids. The achievement of this goal would have implications for rational treatment of heart disease and other, e.g. digestive system related, human diseases that involve the control of free fatty acid levels.     n/a",Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity,6744140,R01GM064746,"['alanine', 'alcohols', 'artificial intelligence', 'chemical models', 'fatty acid binding protein', 'fatty acid transport', 'fatty acids', 'gene mutation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lipid bilayer membrane', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein structure function', 'site directed mutagenesis', 'thermodynamics', 'water']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,271319,-0.0023621606035722836

"Aptamer Development for Cancer Diagnosis and Management DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early diagnosis of disease allows for more effective therapy and better clinical outcomes.  In cancer, extensive effort has gone toward development of screening and diagnostic techniques for early detection of disease. Despite this effort, the probability of single-analyte assays providing the ""silver bullet"" to address these problems for any specific tumor is vanishingly small. A more comprehensive approach that is more likely to succeed is the development of an integrated molecular diagnostic system using multiplexed assays of cancer-related biomarkers coupled with data analysis using bioinformatics-based algorithms. The development of multiplexed assays to improve quality of patient life is a major goal of SomaLogic. SomaLogic's proprietary nucleic-acid based capture agents, photoaptamers, yield quantitative analysis of proteins found in complex biological samples. Using data generated with this assay platform, we expect to develop predictive biomedical algorithms for the diagnosis and management of a variety of diseases, including cancer.   The specific objective of this Phase I proposal is to develop an initial set of photoaptamers targeted to proteins and/or protein complexes that have been associated with a wide variety of solid tumors, i.e., proteinases, proteinase inhibitors, and proteinase-inhibitor complexes, which can then be used to screen clinical samples from patients with a variety of solid tumor types and stages of disease. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop a set of well-defined photoaptamers specific for 20 proteinases, antiproteinases and proteinase-antiproteinase complexes that are believed to be associated with invasion and metastasis of solid tumors; 2) develop a photoaptamer microarray assay (""proteomics chip"") for the measurement of at least 20 cognate proteins or protein complexes in serum or plasma; and 3) evaluate the ranges for these proteins or protein complexes in serum and plasma obtained from normal subjects.

The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,6777359,R01LM007994,"['Internet', 'classification', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular probes', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein purification', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2004,278711,-0.05032414035248783
"Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary purpose of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the means and structures for achieving two goals; (1) to develop intelligent computational aids for mining proteomic data accumulating from high throughput techniques like SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry; and (2) the long-term goal is to gain independence as a biomedical informatics researcher by developing methodological expertise in Bayesian methods and proteomic technologies. Applicant will obtain further instruction in probabilistic methods of data analysis; and she will receive education on proteomic technologies that are driving today's proteome research. Training will be provided through formal coursework, directed readings, seminars and conferences in addition to research directed by excellent mentors.  Applicant's research project involves a novel combination of techniques for use in proteomic data analysis. Previous research has included the use of techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks for analysis of proteomic data. These techniques were not explicitly designed to take into account background and prior knowledge. Hypothesis of this project is that background knowledge and machine learning techniques can positively influence the selection of appropriate biomarkers from proteomic data, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of massive datasets arising from proteomic profiling studies. Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,6811846,K25GM071951,"['bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'human data', 'mass spectrometry', 'proteomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2004,122697,0.048799116368262486
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells. Experience gained in the course of these studies will be used to direct and refine hardware and software development.           n/a",FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY,6720801,R01GM060678,"['Urodela', 'Xenopus', 'animal tissue', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'centromere', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent dye /probe', 'image enhancement', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'small interfering RNA', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2004,622682,-0.0016456936678500291
"COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                                                                                                                  The long-term goal of our research is the development of better methods for          identifying distantly related protein and DNA sequences, and to exploit our          ability to detect distant homologies to explore the duplication, fusion, and         other processes responsible for increases in protein diversity.  Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.

"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids. The achievement of this goal would have implications for rational treatment of heart disease and other, e.g. digestive system related, human diseases that involve the control of free fatty acid levels.     n/a",Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity,6572621,R01GM064746,"['alanine', ' alcohols', ' artificial intelligence', ' chemical models', ' fatty acid binding protein', ' fatty acid transport', ' fatty acids', ' gene mutation', ' intermolecular interaction', ' lipid bilayer membrane', ' molecular dynamics', ' protein structure function', ' site directed mutagenesis', ' thermodynamics', ' water']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,271336,-0.0023621606035722836
"Flexible NLP system for MEDLINE information extraction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation and Research Phase I project focuses on the development of the fully automatic system for extraction of the protein function information from MEDLINE abstracts and conversion it into a form of a conceptual graph. All existent protein function databases depend on human experts who cannot keep up with the exponential growth of protein function information freely available in MEDLINE. There is an urgent need for an automatic system capable of extracting protein function information from literature. The system we proposed will be based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) technologies, and uses it as a fast and reliable way to extract information about protein function from human readable sources. To this end, we have developed and tested MedScan - a prototype of such system that parses scientific abstracts and converts protein function information into a form of a conceptual graph. It consists of a preprocessor module selecting candidate sentences from MEDLINE, an NLP module utilizing proprietary linguistic model to parse the selected sentences, and an information extraction module utilizing developed ontology to extract and validate protein function information. The results of MedScan evaluation indicate that it is a feasible candidate for a proposed task. In Phase II, the software system will be developed to assist the researchers to quickly access, search and navigate through the MEDLINE content, and to visualize and analyze the large volumes of protein function data. We will also extend our approach to other areas including pharmacogenomics and extraction of clinically relevant information. n/a",Flexible NLP system for MEDLINE information extraction,6693928,R43GM067276,"['computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' information dissemination', ' information retrieval', ' information systems', ' molecular biology information system', ' protein structure function']",NIGMS,"ARIADNE GENOMICS, INC.",R43,2003,100000,-0.03372181246435714
"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis. Using          budding yeast genetics and digital imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we will           identify molecular components, including MT motor proteins, that are involved        with the coupling of force generation to the assembly/disassembly of MTs. We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs. Finally, we will analyze how MT dynamics may be involved in the               regulation of cytokinesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION,6635816,R01GM024364,"['Urodela', ' Xenopus', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell cycle', ' cell motility', ' centromere', ' chromosome movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system hardware', ' contact inhibition', ' cytoskeletal proteins', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' meiosis', ' microtubules', ' mitotic spindle apparatus', ' nanotechnology', ' photoactivation', ' protein binding', ' protein biosynthesis', ' protein structure function', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture', ' video microscopy', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2003,347106,0.001372533927109907

Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.  Over the next 2-4 years, more       than six genomes that have diverged in the last 400 million years - an               evolutionary distance sufficiently short that we should be able to identify          all protein homologs - will become available.

"INTEGRATED STRUCTURES FOR PROTEIN MASS SPECTRAL ANALYSIS  APPLICANT'S DESCRIPTION: The proposed research will develop a new technology         for highly automated and highly sensitive analytical systems for the protein         components of complex biological systems. The technology will combine                multi-step sample processes in silicon chip formats with highly sophisticated        tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Micromachining methods that have already          been successful in producing chambers, channels, check valves, filters and           electrospray emitters will be extended to include active valves and                  micro-pumps. The methodologies needed to place chemical systems within the           chip-based structures to perform affinity isolations, enzyme digestions, and         chromatographic and/or electrophoretic separations will be developed. By             combining these operations in a single microscale device, the sample losses in       going from one step to the next will be avoided. These chip-based sample             preparation systems will be interfaced to ion trap mass analyzers capable of         multiple stages of tandem MS analysis. Control of both the on-chip processes         and the MS analysis will be accomplished using a single expert system program.       This program has the capability of analyzing data in real time and changing the      course of the analysis according to a predefined set of rules. The net result        will be a much more efficient and comprehensive method of collecting data, thus      minimizing the amount of time and sample needed. Applications of the new             technology will focus on the characterization of protein posttranslational           modifications with initial emphasis on sites of phosphorylation. The principal       goal of this research is to package very sophisticated analytical tools and          expertise in a form that can be readily exported to other laboratories.              n/a",INTEGRATED STRUCTURES FOR PROTEIN MASS SPECTRAL ANALYSIS,6333670,R01RR006217,"['analytical method', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electrospray ionization mass spectrometry', ' liquid chromatography', ' microprocessor /microchip', ' phosphorylation', ' posttranslational modifications', ' protein protein interaction', ' technology /technique development']",NCRR,CITY OF HOPE/BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2001,455361,0.012391534533081243
"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping.

"COMPUTATIONAL NEUROPEPTIDE DESIGN AND RECEPTOR MATCHING DESCRIPTION: (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract) Proprietary computational and graphical techniques combine elements of eigenvalue and wavelet decompositions, maximum entropy power spectra and ""ergodic"" measure theoretical methods (useful for the analyses of irregular series in hydrodynamic turbulence and plasma physics) with thermodynamic transformation of the amino acids in broad classes of globular and membrane proteins, including G-protein and tyrosine kinase coupled receptors, transporters, pores and channels. In the proposed work, these methods will be used to: 1) Create a referential, graphical atlas of protein sequence transformations through which to characterize and categorize new nucleotide and protein sequences with weak or absent specific amino acid, database homology. The atlas will be used in commercial consultation with investigators confronted with this problem; 2) From only a receptor's primary sequence, generate completely new libraries of membrane protein-targeted, regulatory peptides; and 3) Survey these algorithmically designed new peptides for sequence dependent potentiating or inhibiting influences on natural ligand-induced physiological activity, as demonstrated by microphysiometric assays of native or receptor cDNA transfected cell systems. The resulting physiologically active, patentable peptides will be used in commercial collaboration with research laboratories searching for probes of membrane protein allosteric sites and with drug companies developing respiratory delivery systems for peptide drugs.

"PROTEIN SURFACE DATABASE W/ FAST QUERIES FOR HOMOLOGY The need for general tools to admit facile query of the collection of            information in the Protein Database has become of significant interest           not only within the community of structural biology but also within the          community of molecular biologists interested in using structure to               elucidate sequence and structure-function relationships. While tools have        been developed to implement database queries to find similar protein             substructures or similar 3D constellations of residues, to date no               general tools have been developed to implement queries based on                  similarity between protein surfaces. This seems an egregious omission: it        is the shape and properties of the protein surface which impart its lock-        and-key specificity and are hence responsible for function.  A suite of          tools for the three dimensional query, superposition, and analysis of            protein surfaces would find a plethora of practical applications                 (outlined below), and would significantly enhance the practical value of         the collection of protein structures in the Protein Database. It is the          purpose of this proposal to develop such capabilities, admitting queries,        visualization, and analyses of protein surfaces in terms of steric and           biochemical properties.

"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9994932,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2020,495160,-0.02882381440847371
"Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because these proposed research tasks will lay the groundwork to develop a new class of algorithms and will provide rapid, high-throughput, sensitive, and reproducible and reliable tools for MS based proteomics. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics can allow systematic analysis of thousands of proteins with the promise of discovering new protein biomarkers for different disease conditions and better understanding of human systems biology. Because of high-dimensionality of the big data generated from MS machines efficient, accurate and reproducible tools are required to mine and analyze the data and is the subject of this proposal. Such high-performance tools will be instrumental in elucidating the microbiome which affects virtually all aspects of human health. Therefore, this proposal is relevant to NIH’s broader mission which support fundamental and innovative research strategies which can become the basis of protecting and improving human health.",Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data,9973317,R01GM134384,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Galaxy', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mass spectrometer', 'microbiome', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'program dissemination', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein biomarkers', 'reproductive', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'vector', 'virtual']",NIGMS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,322438,0.028414328713300997
"Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning Project Summary Overview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop new materials, methods, and measurement devices for biomanufacturing, biotherapeutics, and biosensors. We have active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding, enzymatic activity, and cell membrane disruption, 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extract and genetic template improvements), 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPS products, interrogated by nanosensors, 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machine learning and deep learning methods), 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuits, and 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing, wound healing, and water quality. The overall vision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products (cells and proteins) for applications in therapies, advanced materials, and bio-electronics. Protein based therapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years, the design, build, and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically using techniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However, these mutagenic approaches have a few limitations, namely: 1) they require a suitable, naturally occurring sequence as a starting point, 2) they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature, and 3) they operate as a `black box', meaning that generalizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of this MIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discovery of protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integrate the system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis to rapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then be characterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors, to test for desired features such as stability, binding affinity, selectivity, hydrolytic activity, and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeled data set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network to self-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network are found, the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized, tested, etc. such that the design loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in faster development of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing, natural sequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential for reduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translate this technology, via NIH SBIR funding, such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop advanced tools to enable faster discovery and design of protein-based drugs for new disease targets. These tools would enable optimization of multiple parameters simultaneously, creating more potent therapies with less side effects. Thanks to speeding up the development cycle and reducing the time to market, these tools also have the potential to reduce end cost to patients.","Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning",10028304,R35GM138265,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomanufacturing', 'Biosensor', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Template', 'In Vitro', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning strategy', 'nanosensors', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'synthetic biology', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'water quality', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,327666,-0.01634966591961247
"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,0.015549287134013611
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT About 1500 of the ~20,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome can bind drug-like molecules, and yet only about 600 are currently targeted by FDA-approved drugs. Therefore, at least 930 proteins are potential drug targets that are not yet being utilized for human medicine and, given our incomplete state of knowledge about the human genome, the actual number could be much higher. There is therefore a substantial unmet need to improve our understanding of this so-called genomic dark matter in order to develop novel classes of drugs to improve treatment of disease. Comprehensive experimental investigation of these proteins in the context of hundreds of thousands of compounds and thousands of diseases would be prohibitively expensive, but computational approaches could significantly refine the list. In this project we will apply two sophisticated computational approaches to the task of predicting the most promising novel drug targets. We will integrate the knowledge bases DrugCentral and other resources with the disease and phenotype knowledge base of the Monarch Initiative into a semantically harmonized knowledge graph (KG). This will result in a KG with comprehensive coverage of diseases, genes, gene functions, phenotypic abnormalities, drugs, drug mechanisms, and drug targets. Machine learning (ML) identifies patterns from training sets and applies the patterns to predict entities and relations in new data. ML using KGs has become a hot new research area in computer science, but remains difficult to use for real-world applications, owing to the lack of adequate software packages. We will therefore implement state-of-the art learning algorithms based on deep learning on KGs by extending and adapting selected algorithms to the task of drug and drug target discovery. We will develop an easy-to-use software library and demonstrate its use by means of notebooks that will be designed to serve as starting points for future computational research by other scientists, since they will contain the analysis workflow along with documentation about each step. The human genome codes more than 500 protein kinases, which are enzymes that add a phosphate group to specific amino acid residues and thereby transmit a biological signal. There are currently 35 FDA approved protein kinase modulators acting on 38 protein kinases, which are thus one of the most important groups of druggable proteins encoded by our genome. We will perform a detailed computational study of this group and experimentally validate our top, novel candidate using a patient-derived xenograft model system. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The human genome codes for over 20,000 proteins, roughly 3,000 of which are thought to be “druggable”, meaning that in principle they could be targeted by medications to treat disease. However, only about 600 of these proteins are currently targeted by an approved medication, and our knowledge about most of the remaining proteins is limited. Our goal is to develop bioinformatic software that will combine information about these proteins, diseases, clinical manifestations, medications, and other relevant data into a network of information (i.e., a graph), and to use sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict novel drugs and drug targets. We will focus our computational strategy on the class of protein kinase inhibitors, which are a leading target for cancer drugs. The human genome encodes an estimated 555 kinases, 37 of which have been successfully targeted by anti-cancer medications. By using machine learning to predict which of the remaining 500+ protein kinases are most likely to be amenable to medical treatment, there is a potential to accelerate the pace of research into novel treatments. We will perform a pilot study of the top predicted candidates using a mouse model of cancer.",Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs,9878081,U01CA239108,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aloral', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enzymes', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'genome resource', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'open source', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein kinase modulator', 'real world application', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NCI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U01,2020,536615,-0.019506087102037526
"Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics Kidney transplantation offers the best quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure. Antibody and T-cell mediated rejection (ABMR and TCMR) are key factors that determine graft survival. Currently, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rejection relies on histopathologic examination which has known limitations such as subjective interpretations, limited reproducibility, and the need for expert transplant pathologists. There is an unmet need to develop more specific and quantitative molecular tests that can complement and enhance conventional histologic assessment. Among the molecular assays, proteome profiling is more attractive than genomic and transcriptomic profiling which are subjected to numerous post-translational and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, morphologic changes form the basis of classifying different allograft diseases. Therefore, the transplant community needs to invest in biopsy-based assays in addition to the blood/urine-based assays that are being developed by others. This study is aimed to fully map the proteomic changes in routinely processed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform. To meet the needs of personalized medicine, this platform uses a novel strategy and machine learning to simultaneously measure the absolute expression levels of a panel of targeted biomarkers as well as thousands of untargeted proteins. The central hypothesis is that LC-MS/MS can be used to define disease-specific biomarkers using a discovery data set, which can then be followed up by a validation data set to determine if LC-MS/MS based tests can be implemented in clinical practice. In the current project, we will focus on developing molecular assays for ABMR since antibody contributes to graft loss in 60% of patients. Two Aims are proposed. In Aim #1, quantitative proteomic strategies will be used to map proteome-level changes in a discovery set of biopsies with ABMR and its mimics, such as acute tubular injury (ATI), TCMR, BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), and stable renal function (STA). The goal is to identify potential protein biomarkers that can distinguish ABMR from its mimics. In Aim #2, the potential ABMR biomarkers obtained in Aim #1 will be validated and optimized in an independent validation data set. Using a hybrid proteomic platform combing targeted, shotgun proteomics and machine learning, information on absolute quantitation of potential protein biomarkers and thousands of other proteins will be collected to build a kidney transplant Protein Atlas for assay development. Successful completion of this study has great potential to be translated into clinical tests that will enhance the diagnosis of ABMR from other diseases that can mimic that pathology. It will also serve as a model for developing a new generation of clincal diagnositc tests that will use routinely fixed biopsy materials.

"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,9851881,R35GM130354,"['Antibody Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV vaccine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'drug discovery', 'immunogenic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein structure function', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2020,377124,-0.0434078972911956
"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",9942654,R01GM136859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'COSY', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Crowding', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'HMQC', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Weight', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pyruvate', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'TOCSY', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'artificial neural network', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'control theory', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methyl group', 'next generation', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear power', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,495502,-0.045535661820908124
"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins. Reactome is the most comprehensive open source biological pathway knowledgebase.

"High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes Project Summary All folded proteins continuously fluctuate between their low-energy native structures and higher-energy “hidden” conformations that can be partially or fully unfolded. Although each protein molecule passes through its high- energy conformations only a small fraction of the time, these states have major physiological consequences. Partially-folded states of natural proteins can lead to protein aggregation, organ failure, and death. Partially- folded states of therapeutic proteins can induce dangerous anti-drug antibodies. The energetic balance between the native, folded state and these diverse higher-energy states – in other words, the overall “energy landscape” – is thus critically important in protein aggregation and immunogenicity, as well as in allostery, signaling, off- target drug interactions and numerous other phenomena. Despite decades of research into energy landscapes our overall understanding is very limited: few proteins have been characterized in depth, accurate computational predictions are very challenging, and experimental measurements are expensive, slow, and labor-intensive. We propose a transformational approach to understand protein energy landscapes by integrating a new massively parallel experimental method, machine learning, and protein design. First, we are developing a new high-throughput assay using hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to measure energy landscapes for thousands of proteins in parallel. This method finally brings the study of protein energy landscapes into the “omics” age. Critically, these experiments reveal both the overall folding stability and the energies of conformational fluctuations in each protein. For a subset of proteins (tens to hundreds), these parallel experiments reveal the specific sites of conformational fluctuations as well. Using this approach, we will measure the energy landscapes of thousands of natural proteins and tens of thousands of computationally designed proteins custom-built to systematically probe how specific properties affect energy landscapes. We will then train machine learning models to predict energy landscapes from sequence and structure, as well as optimize physical force fields to accurately model high-energy protein states. We will also catalyze advances in modeling throughout the community by organizing large-scale competitions at blind prediction of energy landscapes. Finally, with these new predictive models in hand, we will pursue a unique application: the development of energetically-optimized screening libraries for therapeutic protein and biological probe discovery. This overcomes a major challenge in drug and probe development. In sum, this study provides the experimental and computational tools to bring hidden protein states to light quantitatively on a massive scale. This fundamentally shifts our perspective: instead of examining energy landscapes only when they cause problems, we can make energy landscape analysis a central tool in biology and bioengineering. Project Narrative All proteins continuously move between their folded state and “hidden” higher-energy states that can be partially or fully unfolded. These hidden states have an important impact on how proteins interact, how they become activated, and whether they aggregate. Here, we combine protein design with a totally new high-throughput experimental approach to reveal these high-energy states for thousands of proteins in parallel, and apply these advances to build a new generation of computational models of protein energetics.",High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes,10002881,DP2GM140927,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Generations', 'Hand', 'Hydrogen', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Organ failure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Training', 'blind', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenicity', 'predictive modeling', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,DP2,2020,2347906,-0.042123294436346354
"Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry The identification and quantification of biological macromolecules remains challenging despite major advances in the speed, resolution and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers. A key weakness with current instrumentation lies in the methods used to induce fragmentation. The reliance in particular on collision-induced dissociation (CID) has limited such analyses to bottom-up workflows of trypsin-digested peptides of 10-30 residues. At e-MSion, we have developed an efficient electron-fragmentation technology called ExD for large proteins and are now co-marketed our ExD Option with Agilent, and soon will be with Thermo and Waters instruments. What has really captured the interest of the biopharma and top-down communities in the past year is the exceptional sequence coverage of native proteins we obtain with the same ExD cell. The resulting spectra are less congested than those obtained with currently available ETD/UVPD/CID fragmentation methodologies. We have shown that our technology works faster and gives cleaner spectra with more complete dissociation with larger macromolecular protein complexes than has ever been possible before, while still preserving labile post translational modifications. In addition, fragmentation with higher energy electrons can be used to provide complementary data to improve protein and glycan identification. The challenge now has become how to optimally collect and process these data to maximize the utility of ExD fragmentation. Last summer, Xilinx released its Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a massively parallel processor with 50 billion transistors targeted to transform digital signal processing, handling of big data and artificial intelligence. This ACAP technology has already accelerated Illumina DNA sequence assembly by 90-fold. Our feasibility question asks how to effectively harness this new highly parallelized technology to preprocess complex top-down mass spectra on- the-fly. This will allow us to actively optimize data acquisition by enabling adaptive operation of the ExD cell and mass spectrometer. The objective is to maximize both fragmentation and dissociation of native proteins, enabling faster and comprehensive characterization of challenging proteoforms important to the biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical researchers.  Success will offer an extremely fast, cost-effective solution to characterize complexes of macromolecules under native conditions with increased accuracy, speed, and fewer misidentifications. Our ExD technology with the Versal ACAP can be both retrofitted into existing mass spectrometers as well as being available in new generations of mass spectrometers at a price below other less-effective alternative fragmentation technologies like ETD and UVPD. Thus, it will provide new abilities for many NIH investigators to advance basic research, probe disease mechanisms and permit more sophisticated searches for both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Even with all of the scientific progress made to date, the complexity of disease-affected tissues still challenges our ability to probe what makes people sick. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a powerful computer technology to aid in characterizing biological molecules that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases ranging from arthritis, cancer, diabetes to heart disease and neurodegeneration.",Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry,10081127,R43GM139467,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Arthritis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuous Infusion', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Ions', 'Isoleucine', 'Laboratories', 'Leucine', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Polysaccharides', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Price', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transistors', 'Trypsin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disulfide bond', 'electron energy', 'encryption', 'experience', 'fragment X', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'operation', 'preservation', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'signal processing', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker']",NIGMS,"E-MSION, INC.",R43,2020,212830,0.030386831771301245
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR PROTEOFORM IDENTIFICATION BY TOP-DOWN DATA INDEPENDENT ACQUISITION MASS SPECTROMETRY Summary Mass spectrometry-based top-down proteomics has become one of the most informative approaches in protein analysis because it provides the bird's-eye view of intact proteoforms (protein forms) generated from post-translational modifications and sequence variations. Data dependent acquisition and data independent acquisition are the two main methods in top-down mass spectrometry. The former has been the dominant one, but it has two main challenges in proteome-wide studies: low protein coverage: a regular experiment of human cells can identify only 200 – 400 proteins, and low reproducibility: a technical triplet shares only about one third of identified proteoforms. Top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (TD-DIA-MS) has the potential to significantly increase protein coverage and improve reproducibility in proteome-wide studies. However, its application has been hampered by the complexity of the data and the lack of efficient software tools. To address this problem, we will propose new algorithms and machine learning models and develop the first software package for proteoform identification by TD-DIA-MS. The proposed research will be conducted by a group of researchers with complementary expertise. All the proposed algorithms will be implemented as user-friendly open source software tools. Narrative This project addresses the proteoform identification problem by top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry. We will propose new machine learning models and new algorithms for high-throughput proteome-wide identification of complex proteoforms with post-translational modifications and sequence variations by using top- down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9894822,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'statistical learning', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,473065,-0.01773997184553026
"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning.

"A Proteogenomic Search Engine for Direct Mass Spectrometric Identification of Variant Proteins Using Genomic Data Project Summary / Abstract Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, used in conjunction with genomics, has been called proteogenomics. Recent exponential increases in variant identification by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is redefining the concept of the human genome/proteome. Our project is the commercialization of a first-to-market proteomic database search engine for mass spectrometry capable of directly reading NGS data for the identification of mutilations from individual samples or from curated resources. Such an offering has the potential to bring together these two fields, enabling validation of mutations at the protein-level. Mutated proteins have been shown to make ideal targets for drug therapies and diagnostics in cancer. Our software will provide an intuitive user experience, approachable by scientists who may not be expert both proteomic and genomic data analysis. Since the search engine is guided by prior knowledge, performance exceeds current practice. The software will come complete with a full array of post-processing validation, and visualization tools. Project Narrative The detection of protein variants, which differ from those predicted from the reference human genome sequence, can make ideal candidates for the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics for many clinical conditions such as cancer.

"Rapid and Precise Molecular Pathway Modelling of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Infection Cycle with Human Host Protein and Therapeutic Interactions Project Summary The Reactome Knowledgebase is a widely used and internationally recognized expert-curated, open-source resource of a broad array of human biological processes and their disease counterparts, coupled to powerful tools for data analysis and display, and integrated with diverse community genomics resources. The work proposed here will add molecular annotations of the COVID-19 infection process mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, interactions between viral components and human host proteins that mediate the severity of viral infection, and the effects of therapeutics and drug-like compounds on both viral and host proteins. The resulting SARS-CoV-2 pathway annotations will provide a framework for pathway- and network-based data analysis and visualization, which will be critical for the interpretation of numerous COVID-19 studies now and in the future. In collaboration with a team of community experts in virology, drug design, and infectious disease, we will assemble information in two stages. First, a draft annotation will associate relevant SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV- 2 viral and host cell proteins with each stage of the infection process and the host response to it. These annotations will be immediately useful for identifying additional relevant interacting proteins, for assessing possible effects of variation in the host or viral proteins on specific steps of viral infection, and for identifying possible drug targets. In the second stage, the SARS-CoV-2 map will be annotated more extensively to fill in molecular details of each step in these processes and to highlight differences in the processes mediated by SARS- CoV-2 virus and related coronaviruses. This annotation process will continue for the duration of the project to incorporate newly validated molecular details as they are uncovered by the research community. All the data, code and tools developed by this project will be open source and open. Project Narrative Using long-established Reactome Knowledgebase standards for authorship, curation and peer-review of molecular pathway data from published and unpublished sources, we will annotate the molecular details of the processes by which SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 coronaviruses infect human cells. This will include the interactions among viral and host proteins, the expression of viral proteins likely to trigger innate and adaptive immunity, and an annotation of the molecular effects of drugs on these processes. Our strategy will allow rapid revision and extension of annotations as data accumulate, will support close integration with other community resources, and will generate a valuable resource for community analysis of experimental data sets relevant to COVID-19 disease.",Rapid and Precise Molecular Pathway Modelling of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Infection Cycle with Human Host Protein and Therapeutic Interactions,10165320,U41HG003751,"['2019-nCoV', 'Authorship', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Paper', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Severities', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'data tools', 'data visualization', 'experimental analysis', 'knowledge base', 'open source', 'protein expression', 'small molecule', 'structured data', 'tool', 'virology']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2020,310292,-0.0004494259372614284
"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9868886,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'de-immunization', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2020,188164,-0.001329429854859976
"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å Cα-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"Skyline Targeted Proteomics Environment Development on Skyline started in 2008 to fill a critical need for a software tool that enabled targeted proteomics experiments. Since then, Skyline has grown into an entire ecosystem of tools, expanding well beyond targeted proteomics. The Skyline software ecosystem is one of the most widely used software platforms in all of mass spectrometry, supporting thousands of investigators in their research. The synergy between Skyline software development and its vast and thriving user community uniquely generate exciting new opportunities for quantitative mass spectrometry. Skyline has been a key factor in the success and growth of this new field, with Skyline itself becoming one of the most significant software tools in mass spectrometry. Since 2015, we have expanded Skyline software, from just the traditional targeted proteomics experiments that used selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometers, to broadly encompass ALL types of quantitative proteomics experiments, including data dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments using MS1 peak areas (aka MS1 filtering), targeted tandem mass spectrometry (aka parallel reaction monitoring or PRM) experiments and data independent acquisition (DIA). As of Oct 2019, Skyline has been installed >97,500 times (117% increase since 2015), has over 14,000 registered users (122% increase since 2015) on its website (http://skyline.ms) and is booted up >9,000 times per week (exceeding 17,500 bootups in a single week). The Skyline project has grown beyond the bounds of a single tool. Currently, there are 14 Skyline external tools (55% increase since 2015) that rely on a formalized framework in Skyline and available through its tool store, with more still in development. The prior grant cycle has greatly expanded a community of users and developers working with a common set of tools to analyze quantitative data from all six major mass spectrometry vendors. Specifically, our proposal has five aims. 1) Improve Skyline’s analysis of DDA data, 2) Improve Skyline’s analysis of DIA data, 3) Expand support of new molecule types within Skyline, 4) Support for new quantitative data types, and 5) Provide continued support and training for the Skyline ecosystem. Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis diverse molecule types in health and disease. Targeted mass spectrometry measurements offer a promising alternative to immunological based assays that are the standard for quantitative protein measurements in clinical and basic research laboratories. Critical to these experiments is our software, Skyline and the associated ecosystem of tools, which have been developed to handle the generation of instrument methods and the subsequent analysis of the resulting data.",Skyline Targeted Proteomics Environment,10049625,R01GM103551,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Scientist', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Flow Injection Analysis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Immunologics', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Peptides', 'Polysaccharides', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'ion mobility', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'new growth', 'open source', 'search engine', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'success', 'synergism', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,258335,0.03238629296609486
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9849781,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,393339,-0.00932823469157093
"Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo Abstract Proteins rarely act in isolation, but rather function in multi-protein complexes. Accordingly, protein-protein interactomes are exceptionally valuable resources that provide deep mechanistic insights and generate myriad hypotheses. Current methods for interactome mapping, such as affinity purification mass-spectrometry (APMS), are extremely difficult to deploy in vivo, so little comprehensive interactome data yet exists for developing embryos and even less for specific tissues within embryos. This fact poses an especially acute problem for understanding highly dynamic processes in which post-transcriptional controls dominate, for example collective cell movements. Here, we will use tissue engaged in convergent extension, a crucial collective movement that elongates the axis of animal embryos, to test the efficacy of new label-free interactome mapping approaches. Successful completion of the project will therefore be significant both for developing broadly applicable new methods and also for providing systems-level insights into a disease- relevant, vertebrate collective cell movement. Project Narrative: This study centers on developing novel methods for systematically identifying protein-protein interactions in embryos. To explore the utility of the method, we focus our efforts on proteins involved in collective cell movements called convergent extension, which are governed by the planar cell polarity (or PCP) proteins. These experiments will be significant because defects in PCP proteins or convergent extension lead to “neural tube defects” such as spina bifida and anencephaly, as well as congenital skeletal dysplasias.",Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo,10104048,R21HD103882,"['Actomyosin', 'Acute', 'Adhesions', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Amphibia', 'Anencephaly and spina bifida X linked', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Cadherins', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Fractionation', 'Genetic', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mesoderm', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neural Tube Closure', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rana', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Spectrometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'base', 'cell motility', 'convergent extension', 'data integration', 'efficacy testing', 'embryo tissue', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'novel', 'planar cell polarity', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'skeletal dysplasia', 'success', 'vertebrate embryos']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2020,237750,-0.0042646831145588095
"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation.

"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9986784,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,369690,-0.010671288709172198
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing. Project narrative UniProt is the world’s leading resource of protein sequence and functional information, covering all species including Homo sapiens, model organisms and pathogens. UniProt annotates protein function using community-standard ontologies to support the interpretation of genomic and other datasets on which biomedical research and precision medicine depend.

"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance. Funding of this proposal will allow us to provide research results, as well as high-quality data and software for the identification of transporter proteins useful to scientists whose investigations focus on health issues.",The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB),9895808,R01GM077402,"['Activator Appliances', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Island', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Ontology', 'Organelles', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transmembrane Transport', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'base', 'data pipeline', 'drug development', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'member', 'metagenome', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'protein transport', 'screening', 'text searching', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'whole genome', 'willingness']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,315000,0.010512913510417228
