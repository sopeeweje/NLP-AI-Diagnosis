"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9583421,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2019,92213,0.042775746097464
"Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk ABSTRACT Whereas the majority of smokers will quit in any given year, the majority of quit attempts result in relapse. One reason interventions may fail is that they teach smokers strategies for coping with craving in response to environmental triggers, but do not provide smokers with just-in-time information about their risk of smoking lapse. Such risk information could be used to alert smokers to engage in relevant coping strategies including avoidance or use of quick acting pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine inhaler). The overarching premise of the proposed research is that prediction of lapse risk can be enhanced by using computer vision to analyze images of everyday life. Recent findings by our team suggest that environments associated with lapse risk can be detected in real-time by coupling deep learning-based object detection with an appropriate classification model. In preliminary research, images taken by smokers of smoking and nonsmoking environments (80 subjects, 2870 images) were used to train such a model, resulting in 77.5% accuracy (0.826 AUC) distinguishing these environments on a separate test set (16 subjects, 516 images). Encouraged by this preliminary finding, we propose to refine and scale up this system by a) creating a larger and more representative image database that includes a sample of everyday environments acquired from smokers (n=60) and b) testing novel, personalized approaches for increasing smoking environment classification accuracy and assessing smoking risk across three aims. In Aim 1, we will improve smoking environment classification accuracy and prediction of smoking risk by re-training an existing deep learning model to recognize a broad set of smoking-related objects (e.g. packs of cigarettes/ashtrays). In Aim 2, we will further improve performance by fitting personalized models that account for individual differences in preferred or typical smoking environments. In Exploratory Aim 3, we will predict craving and negative affect/stress using a similar approach. The proposed research represents an innovative and critical next step in the development of a system that identifies smoking risk and/or its antecedents in real-time to support a just-in-time adaptive intervention for smoking cessation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of smokers relapse within one month of quitting smoking. Environments (e.g. park) and their related objects (e.g. park bench) are associated with smoking and urges to smoke and can serve as triggers to lapse and relapse. The proposed research will use state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection to identify smoking risk environments and objects with the goal of eventually developing systems that alert smokers to such risks from everyday images acquired with cameras worn by smokers. Such a system can be incorporated into more comprehensive and effective smoking cessation programs.",Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk,9774018,R21DA047131,"['Adult', 'Behavior', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nicotine Inhaler', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Shelter facility', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'coping', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'negative affect', 'non-smoking', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'time use']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,201250,0.049451078647101944
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9688867,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,416786,0.0727930005564757
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9613247,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2019,165108,0.009041877869729013
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,-0.03561269870957528
"Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome There is an essential gap in understanding the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior of adults with Down syndrome (DS): objective assessment of these behaviors with accelerometers has not been developed for this population. If this gap remains unfilled, it may impede efforts to objectively quantify the problem of inactivity in adults with DS and to develop effective interventions for improving physical activity and reducing health disparities in this population. Objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior for adults with DS will advance by considering their pathologically low aerobic fitness. It may also improve by applying to accelerometer output innovative machine-learning modes. The long-term goals of the present applicants are to understand the determinants of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS and develop effective interventions for improving their physical activity and health. The objective of this application, in pursuit of the long-term goals, is to calibrate accelerometer output for measuring physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with DS. The central hypothesis is that machine learning applied to accelerometer output will permit accurate prediction of physical activity type and intensity in adults with DS. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data and previous work that has successfully developed machine learning models for individuals without disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that accurate measurement of physical activity and sedentariness will lead to better monitoring of these behaviors in adults with DS and to more precise quantification of the effects of interventions for improving their health. Guided by the applicants’ preliminary data and previous work, and a critical review of the empirical knowledge-base, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) compare the relationship between accelerometer output and energy expenditure across various physical activities and sedentary behaviors between adults with and without DS; and (2) develop machine learning models from accelerometer output and evaluate their accuracy for predicting physical activity type and energy expenditure in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 1, output from hip- and wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers and energy expenditure expressed relative to aerobic fitness will be measured during physical activities and sedentary behaviors in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 2, machine learning models for predicting physical activity type and intensity will be developed in samples of adults with and without DS, and their prediction accuracy will be tested in two additional samples. The approach is innovative, because: (a) it will calibrate accelerometer output while accounting for aerobic fitness; (b) it will refine calibration by utilizing machine learning models. The proposed research is significant because it will allow researchers and public health agencies to more precisely monitor the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS. Such knowledge is critical for the development of interventions for improving physical activity, health, and quality of life in adults with DS. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing valid objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with Down syndrome is an essential step towards designing effective interventions for improving physical activity, fitness, health, and quality of life in these persons. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NICHD’s mission that pertains to ensuring the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.",Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome,9730779,R15HD098660,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Calibration', 'Data', 'Down Syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinesiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'graduate student', 'hands-on learning', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'national surveillance', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'therapy development', 'undergraduate student']",NICHD,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,423824,0.03137859938374306
"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9768419,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,606526,0.011672097394329521
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",9661385,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,200000,0.031102754467115454
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,0.02642361181170507
"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys. Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent developments in mobile technology suggest new and innovative ways to deliver effective smoking cessation treatments. This project will test the feasibility of using a smartband to automatically monitor and detect smoking and deliver real time mindfulness interventions via smartphone app to reduce smoking.

"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9658873,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,317858,0.0357883926039705
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,9818246,R01DK122473,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Elderly', 'Energy Intake', 'Feedback', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthy Eating', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastication', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'healthy weight', 'increased appetite', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'sucking', 'synergism', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'weight maintenance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2019,663683,0.013822898018613592
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.

Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9902662,R01MD010362,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavior change', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cohesion', 'contextual factors', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'disability', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,102704,0.05287976790360687
"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9778822,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,660041,-0.02384373862104218
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9701986,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2019,362004,0.0718566673579049
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9671858,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2019,613264,0.06504655916003314
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9750800,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2019,118352,-0.040865953860912387
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,0.05717233799936877
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9712868,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,1612047,-0.0009377586525184774
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9780348,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2019,41136,0.03099955214617312
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9772539,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,189743,0.015767228016413903
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace.

"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,9667415,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Acrolein', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aldehydes', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Antioxidants', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Endothelium', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Immunologic Markers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxic effect', 'Urine', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'combustion product', 'immune activation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'marijuana smoke', 'marijuana use', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'monocyte', 'network models', 'neutrophil', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tobacco exposure', 'transcriptome', 'vascular inflammation', 'volatile organic compound']",NIDA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,648591,-0.005847512722036188
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,0.01031735489926969
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9782867,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,432923,0.017737651502951462
"Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk ABSTRACT Whereas the majority of smokers will quit in any given year, the majority of quit attempts result in relapse. One reason interventions may fail is that they teach smokers strategies for coping with craving in response to environmental triggers, but do not provide smokers with just-in-time information about their risk of smoking lapse. Such risk information could be used to alert smokers to engage in relevant coping strategies including avoidance or use of quick acting pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine inhaler). The overarching premise of the proposed research is that prediction of lapse risk can be enhanced by using computer vision to analyze images of everyday life. Recent findings by our team suggest that environments associated with lapse risk can be detected in real-time by coupling deep learning-based object detection with an appropriate classification model. In preliminary research, images taken by smokers of smoking and nonsmoking environments (80 subjects, 2870 images) were used to train such a model, resulting in 77.5% accuracy (0.826 AUC) distinguishing these environments on a separate test set (16 subjects, 516 images). Encouraged by this preliminary finding, we propose to refine and scale up this system by a) creating a larger and more representative image database that includes a sample of everyday environments acquired from smokers (n=60) and b) testing novel, personalized approaches for increasing smoking environment classification accuracy and assessing smoking risk across three aims. In Aim 1, we will improve smoking environment classification accuracy and prediction of smoking risk by re-training an existing deep learning model to recognize a broad set of smoking-related objects (e.g. packs of cigarettes/ashtrays). In Aim 2, we will further improve performance by fitting personalized models that account for individual differences in preferred or typical smoking environments. In Exploratory Aim 3, we will predict craving and negative affect/stress using a similar approach. The proposed research represents an innovative and critical next step in the development of a system that identifies smoking risk and/or its antecedents in real-time to support a just-in-time adaptive intervention for smoking cessation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of smokers relapse within one month of quitting smoking. Environments (e.g. park) and their related objects (e.g. park bench) are associated with smoking and urges to smoke and can serve as triggers to lapse and relapse. The proposed research will use state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection to identify smoking risk environments and objects with the goal of eventually developing systems that alert smokers to such risks from everyday images acquired with cameras worn by smokers. Such a system can be incorporated into more comprehensive and effective smoking cessation programs.",Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk,9617141,R21DA047131,"['Adult', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nicotine Inhaler', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Shelter facility', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'coping', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'negative affect', 'non-smoking', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'time use']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,200208,0.049451078647101944
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9464374,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,470142,0.0727930005564757
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9453227,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2018,166481,0.009041877869729013
"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calories', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietitian', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Malnutrition', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Wearable Computer', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'digital models', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'healthy lifestyle', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle factors', 'mathematical model', 'negative affect', 'programs', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,0.06617889097863291
"CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low bac1ak  The objective of this proposal is to address core scientific challenges related to sensing, actuation and control of cyber-physically assistive clothing (CPAC). CPAC is a kind of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (HCPS), in which actuated clothing is coordinated in unison with human body movement to enhance safety and health. We propose addressing key HCPS challenges within the context of using CPAC to reduce societal incidence of low back pain, by preventing lumbar (spine) overloading and overuse injuries. Low back pain is targeted because it is one of the leading causes of physical disability and missed work. High and/or repetitive forces on lumbar muscles and discs can occur during daily tasks, and are known to be major risk factors that can lead to back pain and injury. The long-term vision is to create smart clothing that can monitor lumbar loading, train safe movement patterns, and directly assist wearers to reduce the musculoskeletal forces that cause pain and injury. This proposed transformation of clothing is similar to how wristwatches have transformed from timepieces into health monitors; however, CPAC is even more exciting because it combines the form-factor of clothing with the assistance benefits of an exoskeleton to reduce biological tissue loading for a broad range of individuals, occupations and tasks. Thrust 1 will adapt machine learning techniques in order to monitor lumbar loading and detect excessive spine forces via portable, wearable sensors, such that timely feedback/intervention can be provided. This thrust will result in the creation of a publicly shared data set that contains synchronized, multimodal (lab-based and wearable) sensor data collected from >500 actions per subject, the largest such corpus for machine learning in this domain. Thrust 2 will model the dynamics of cyber, physical and human components of CPAC in order to develop optimal control and learning strategies. Thrust 3 will integrate sensors, fusion algorithms and portable actuation into a complete wearable prototype. A human subject experiment will be performed to objectively evaluate the function of CPAC. At the focus of this proposal is the human body; monitored, analyzed and assisted by multidisciplinary CPS technologies. The project integrates expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, sensor fusion, soft robotics, wearable assistive technology, and clinical management of low back pain to transform clothing from materials that cover the body into wearable systems that can track and protect low back health. The key scientific HCPS challenges that need to be overcome, and which are addressed in this proposed research, in order to realize the broad societal benefits of CPAC are: (1) real-time sensing and assistive control of the HCPS and its co-adaptation to different subjects and diverse environments, (2) system design and verification ensuring safe operation and that no harm is done to human subjects through unanticipated feedback, (3) selection and placement of low cost sensors aiding affordable and realistic manufacturing of CPAC, (4) integration of wearable sensors and actuators into a reliable and effective HCPS. CPAC has the potential for broad societal impact given the high prevalence of low back pain. CPAC provides a unique and potentially paradigm-shifting opportunity because it combines the assistive benefits of an exoskeleton with the lightweight and unobtrusive form-factor of everyday clothing. CPAC is expected to (1) fit seamlessly into daily life, (2) connect individuals with health info to empower them to modify their physical activity, (3) generate public health data to inform evidence-based clinical and workplace practices, (4) augment lifting biomechanics to reduce lumbar loading, (5) reduce incidence of low back pain, and costs due to health care and missed work.",CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low bac1ak ,9755822,R01EB028105,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Back Injuries', 'Back Pain', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clothing', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lifting', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Occupations', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cost', 'cyber physical', 'data sharing', 'design', 'evidence base', 'exoskeleton', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,310023,-0.09871732183301066
"A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants Ensuring access to clean water for generations to come will involve developing novel ap- proaches to determining the safety and composition of potable water that are practical and afford- able. Arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are three of the top priorities among hazardous substances commonly found at Superfund sites, as they are linked to health problems in people exposed to them in drinking water, yet the current real-time monitoring methods for these and other contam- inants are either extremely costly or nonexistent, making it difﬁcult to monitor water quality with high spatial or temporal resolution. QBiSci is developing a biosensor that uses synthetic micro- bial sensor strains that ﬂuoresce in response to speciﬁc toxins to continuously monitor water for contamination. The platform will substantially improve upon currently available technologies for toxin detection, making monitoring more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable. Speciﬁc Aim 1: To fully characterize three synthetic E. coli strains that speciﬁcally detect ar- senic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water stream. For a real-time sensor to be maxi- mally effective, it must be able to report accurate toxin concentrations in real-time. Focusing on three of the highest priority contaminants as a proof of feasibility, comprehensive data will be acquired to train a machine learning algorithm to be able classify real-world samples in real-time. Speciﬁc Aim 2: To develop and train a classiﬁcation algorithm to recognize the type and amount of each contaminant present in a continuous water stream. The ability to analyze and interpret data in real-time from a constantly ﬂuctuating water source will require an extensive classiﬁcation train- ing effort. QBiSci's existing machine learning framework will be trained and tested using many contamination induction scenarios, ranging from sudden pulses to subtly varying concentrations. Speciﬁc Aim 3: To develop a microﬂuidic cartridge system that reduces device complexity and enables sensor deployment with minimal intervention. QBiSci will develop a swappable car- tridge system using devices that are pre-loaded with biologically-stable strains and can simply be “plugged in” to the sensor platform to achieve repeatable results in a user-friendly manner. The development of a method for thermoplastic device fabrication will enable the more precise connections required for a cartridge clamping system that will require little operational expertise.  A successful outcome of this proposal will lead to a biosensor capable of real-time quantiﬁca- tion of arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water input. A future Phase II proposal would focus on real-world performance evaluations of our sensors via deployment in areas of con- cern and comparison of our results to standard techniques as well as an expansion of the platform to detect other contaminants quantitatively and continuously. 1 Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country over 100,000 hazardous waste sites are so heavily contaminated that the un- derlying groundwater doesn't meet drinking water standards. While there is a wide range of toxins found at these sites, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are among the most common offend- ers, all of which have been linked to a variety of health problems ranging from cancer to dia- betes as well as behavior and neurological disorders. We are developing a customizable real-time biosensor that will enable contamination monitoring to become more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable and will facilitate improved management decisions aimed at reducing toxin con- centrations in the environment, tracking the progression of contamination plums, and targeting investments in remediation efforts. 1",A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants,9467134,R43ES028993,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arsenic', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Cadmium', 'Classification', 'Closure by clamp', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hazardous Substances', 'Hazardous Waste Sites', 'Health', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plug-in', 'Plum', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'contaminated water', 'cost', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'real time monitoring', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'superfund site', 'temporal measurement', 'user-friendly', 'water quality']",NIEHS,"QUANTITATIVE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,162205,0.014350793503879695
"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9576355,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,672594,0.011672097394329521
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9586309,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2018,232214,0.07547305528061021
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9524533,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,712358,-0.02384373862104218
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9682871,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,40644,0.03099955214617312
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9470866,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2018,345436,0.0718566673579049
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9545867,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2018,117680,-0.040865953860912387
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9355893,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2018,92000,-0.009937816035126524
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9442751,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2018,673206,0.06504655916003314
"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9647728,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,446068,0.017737651502951462

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9547313,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Breathing', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Cigarette', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'arm movement', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'data to knowledge', 'experience', 'field study', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'uptake', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,1,0.04988193598433372
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9464147,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,1524997,-0.0009377586525184774
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9502787,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mobility enhancement', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,227166,0.015767228016413903
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected.

"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,9548431,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Acrolein', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aldehydes', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Antioxidants', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Immunologic Markers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxic effect', 'Urine', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'combustion product', 'immune activation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'marijuana smoke', 'marijuana use', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'monocyte', 'network models', 'neutrophil', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tobacco exposure', 'transcriptome', 'vascular inflammation', 'volatile organic compound']",NIDA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2018,616530,-0.005847512722036188
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9290961,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,441204,0.0727930005564757
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9346616,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,172086,0.06529280862689203
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9537132,R01MD010362,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavior change', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cohesion', 'contextual factors', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'disability', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social health determinants', 'tool']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,810198,0.05287976790360687
"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9357585,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,300665,0.025024949319274657
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9210068,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2017,152937,0.06754629619446424
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9386536,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2017,118352,-0.040865953860912387

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9308944,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2017,339155,0.0718566673579049
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission. Specifically, it fits well into the theme of ""Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness"" by helping elderly individuals to stay physically active and prevent the illnesses associated with the sedentary lifestyle.",NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP),9313141,R01NR016151,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Caregivers', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Emergency response', 'Environment', 'Equine mule', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Locomotion', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2017,125000,-0.01372281126289491
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9284636,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2017,566219,0.06504655916003314
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,0.008334627081588317
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use.

"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9030093,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,542228,0.0727930005564757
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9180261,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,221705,0.06529280862689203
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,0.0212148865444749
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities among African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit.

"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.        ",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9078547,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning network', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,299438,0.025024949319274657

About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.                ",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9035822,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2016,199277,0.06754629619446424
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,9132699,R01CA179977,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'High Fat Diet', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'collaborative environment', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'obesogenic', 'physical inactivity', 'residence', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sugar', 'tv watching', 'walkability']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,816993,0.01971083056423384
"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",9148070,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2016,47190,0.028353817554688087
"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization. The team members with clinical expertise have been engaged in blood pressure trials in US, and have been working with leading institutions in India engaged in cardiovascular research. This proposal brings together their unique expertise and experience to innovatively address this challenging problem through a joint effort. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unmanaged hypertension is a major problem, and its management based on occasional measurement is known to be suboptimal. The ability to measure blood pressure using non- invasive techniques in an ambulatory setting has many significant benefits.

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9157753,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary activity', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2016,400434,0.0718566673579049
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission.

"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will clarify why the majority of smokers relapse quickly following a quit attempt.        ",Neural basis of smoking relapse,9079131,R01DA041402,"['Abstinence', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Counseling', 'Cues', 'Economic Burden', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Insula of Reil', 'Investigation', 'Left', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Status', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral response', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'nicotine patch', 'nicotine replacement', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relapse risk', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'stress reactivity', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,523814,0.04708127352791321
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall.

"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9131810,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2016,187000,0.024103794605953886
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8892263,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,413392,0.0212148865444749

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8891470,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor impairment', 'named group', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2015,223669,0.05274167871264462
"In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new system called GaitRF that can measure walking speed and other detailed gait parameters passively within the home. The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as those suffering from neurologic or physical ailments. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. Gait is typically measured periodically within a clinical setting. In-home monitoring offers the advantage of continuous and ongoing measurements providing significantly more information about changes in a patient's health under real life conditions. Ongoing accurate estimation of gait within the home can help to guide caregivers about the need for transitioning older adults to higher levels of care. Accurate in-home gait monitoring also has the potential to encourage older adults to maintain independence later into their lives by enabling family members and friends to monitor health status remotely.  The proposed system makes use of novel wireless technology being developed at EmbedRF. An array of tiny transceivers are positioned in either a hallway or doorframe and configured to wirelessly send radio frequency (RF) signals between each other. As a person walks past the transceivers, their body disrupts the RF signal strength allowing for the estimation of gait metric without the need for the person to wear any monitoring device. Preliminary results using only 2 or 4 transceivers have already demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate walking speed. Preliminary results also show the unique ability to discriminate between individuals for use in a multi-resident home or to exclude data when a caregiver or friend visits. Specific aims in this proposal will 1) further develop prototype systems for walking speed estimation using transceiver pairs, 2) research and develop use of an array of sensors placed at base-board height in order to extract more detailed gait metrics; a second transceiver pair will be placed at approximate head height to provide multi-person discrimination capability, and 3) perform preliminary in-home evaluations of the GaitRF system. Advanced machine learning and tracking algorithms will be utilized to process the RF signals to extract gait metrics. We will evaluate the performance of GaitRF in both a laboratory setting and within single-resident and multi- resident homes of seniors.  If successful, this new system has the advantage of being low-cost, unobtrusive, and easy to install, while still providing accurate and detailed gait metrics. The system can be used as a stand-alone gait monitor or incorporated into more general health monitoring systems. Application of the technology will support independent living and may also be used in clinical trials of drugs or procedures that affect mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as individuals suffering from cognitive or physical impairment. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of socioeconomic status, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, context/environment, and acute precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit.                ","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",8965058,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Cohort Studies', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Trust', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'interest', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mindfulness', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social health determinants', 'stressor']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,665384,0.047430023988370686
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed. The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.",Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit,8840546,R01CA164993,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Cancer Control', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Housekeeping', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marshal', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'computerized data processing', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'novel', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,536065,0.05267549823209476
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8906825,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'collaborative environment', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,751279,0.01971083056423384
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery. Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8934076,R44DA035051,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Affective', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antismoking', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bupropion', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clonidine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cytosine', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'GABA Agonists', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mecamylamine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moclobemide', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'Nortriptyline', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Social Welfare', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical efficacy', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'nicotine abuse', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'varenicline']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2015,915977,0.010519536722809216
"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",8980210,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2015,56042,0.028353817554688087
"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,164698,0.008334627081588317
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.                ",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8749880,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'named group', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2014,204427,0.05274167871264462
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading preventable cause of death, responsible for one in five deaths annually in the United States alone. Many adult smokers want to or try to quit smoking, but, are unable to do so due to lack of personalized cessation treatments that ultimately leads to successful quitting. The primary hurdle has been the unavailability of technology that can be used to collect continuous measurements of stress contexts in field on predictors of abstinence and relapse. Without these measurements, it is difficult to understand the psychophysiological and biobehavioral stress mechanisms that may predict smoke lapse. This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse. Given the adverse impact of smoking on smokers and non-smokers, such advancement will significantly improve the quality of life and reduce public health burden.",Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context,8720744,R01DA035502,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Commuting', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Moderate Exercise', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Posture', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'Withholding Treatment', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'cigarette smoking', 'coping', 'cost', 'hazard', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'non-smoker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'social', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2014,412836,0.06094742397741524
"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8722512,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,715557,0.01971083056423384
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.         Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8901369,R44DA035051,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Affective', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antismoking', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bupropion', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clonidine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cytosine', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'GABA Agonists', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mecamylamine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moclobemide', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'Nortriptyline', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Social Welfare', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical efficacy', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'nicotine abuse', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'varenicline']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2014,691074,0.010519536722809216
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180608,0.008334627081588317
"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING  PROJECT ABSTRACT Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.            ",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8620889,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198360,0.002628521854880787
"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children. We will develop models to assess physical activity and to predict energy expenditure in preschoolers using advanced technology (room calorimetry, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, miniaturized heart rate monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity and energy expenditure in preschool-aged children.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,0.0212148865444749
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading preventable cause of death, responsible for one in five deaths annually in the United States alone. Many adult smokers want to or try to quit smoking, but, are unable to do so due to lack of personalized cessation treatments that ultimately leads to successful quitting. The primary hurdle has been the unavailability of technology that can be used to collect continuous measurements of stress contexts in field on predictors of abstinence and relapse. Without these measurements, it is difficult to understand the psychophysiological and biobehavioral stress mechanisms that may predict smoke lapse. This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse. Given the adverse impact of smoking on smokers and non-smokers, such advancement will significantly improve the quality of life and reduce public health burden.            ",Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context,8542814,R01DA035502,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Commuting', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Moderate Exercise', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Posture', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'Withholding Treatment', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'cigarette smoking', 'coping', 'cost', 'hazard', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'non-smoker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'social', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2013,433185,0.06094742397741524
"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures. These generic tools for daily care and research can be deployed across diseases and disabilities.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.                ",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8590146,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,733604,0.01971083056423384
"Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S.; worldwide it results in >5,000,000 premature deaths each year. The majority of smokers express a desire to quit, and each year more than half will. However, less than 7% of those who quit will achieve long-term abstinence. Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of the first cigarette following a quit attempt (i.e. lapse), which include situations (e.g. presence of other smokers) and activities (e.g. alcohol consumption). While ideally this information could be used to develop a system that detects these predictive antecedents in real-time and provides just-in-time intervention; to date no such systems have been developed. The overarching goal of our research program is to develop and test such a system that uses smartphone technology. The system developed here can be incorporated into diverse application platforms that target the modification of smoking and multiple other health related behaviors including drug and alcohol use, food consumption and physical activity. Despite the fact that smoking is a known cause of death and disability, many smokers find it very difficult to quit and those who do quit often return to smoking (i.e. lapse). Although the situational factors leading up to a lapse are well documented, treatments designed to interrupt these situations before relapse occurs have not been forthcoming. Here, we propose to develop a smartphone-based system that can detect these situations in real-time. Once developed, the sensor system can be incorporated into mobile smoking cessation applications designed to help smokers avoid relapse.",Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior,8494033,R21DA034471,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Paper', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Salivary', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Motion', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'drinking', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'food consumption', 'innovation', 'premature', 'programs', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'sound', 'technology development', 'technology/technique', 'therapy design', 'virtual', 'visual imagery']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,188400,0.037375053509830745
"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children. We will develop models to assess physical activity and to predict energy expenditure in preschoolers using advanced technology (room calorimetry, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, miniaturized heart rate monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity and energy expenditure in preschool-aged children.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data.

This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse. Given the adverse impact of smoking on smokers and non-smokers, such advancement will significantly improve the quality of life and reduce public health burden.              By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.        Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure. We plan to make a suite of software publicly available to allow others to apply this technology in their own research.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications.

We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S.; worldwide it results in >5,000,000 premature deaths each year. The majority of smokers express a desire to quit, and each year more than half will. However, less than 7% of those who quit will achieve long-term abstinence. Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of the first cigarette following a quit attempt (i.e. lapse), which include situations (e.g. presence of other smokers) and activities (e.g. alcohol consumption). While ideally this information could be used to develop a system that detects these predictive antecedents in real-time and provides just-in-time intervention; to date no such systems have been developed. The overarching goal of our research program is to develop and test such a system that uses smartphone technology. The system developed here can be incorporated into diverse application platforms that target the modification of smoking and multiple other health related behaviors including drug and alcohol use, food consumption and physical activity. Despite the fact that smoking is a known cause of death and disability, many smokers find it very difficult to quit and those who do quit often return to smoking (i.e. lapse). Although the situational factors leading up to a lapse are well documented, treatments designed to interrupt these situations before relapse occurs have not been forthcoming. Here, we propose to develop a smartphone-based system that can detect these situations in real-time. Once developed, the sensor system can be incorporated into mobile smoking cessation applications designed to help smokers avoid relapse.",Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior,8402249,R21DA034471,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Paper', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Salivary', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Motion', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'drinking', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'food consumption', 'innovation', 'premature', 'programs', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'sound', 'technology development', 'technology/technique', 'therapy design', 'virtual', 'visual imagery']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,196250,0.037375053509830745
"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children. We will develop models to assess physical activity and to predict energy expenditure in preschoolers using advanced technology (room calorimetry, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, miniaturized heart rate monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity and energy expenditure in preschool-aged children.               In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of smoking behavior.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

The device can provide the user and health professional feedback on the frequency of smoking and inhalation patterns (such as depth of inhalation and smoke holding) throughout the day in their home and community. This information can be used to inform behavioral strategies in smoking cessation programs.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters.

"Interactive, Self-programming, AI System for Activity Monitoring of the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). More than half felt they were ""on duty"" 24 hours a day, and half had to end/reduce employment due to the demands of care-giving. Ingenium proposes to create a practical, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly, disabled, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. The goal in this proposal is to produce a system that can reliably recognize activities using only one Ingenium wireless room-master per room and an Ingenium wearable wireless badge linked to an AI system with self-learning capability. This is accomplished through the interactive badge and room masters. In contrast, existing technology uses many sensors and requires off-line processing to train the activity recognizer and is not useable beyond laboratory environments. Additionally, no current commercial system has interactive planning and scheduling support. Ingenium will utilize the assistance of the AI lab staff at Washington State University which is an acknowledged leader in recognizing activities of daily living. Aim #1 will re-create the WSU technology, transfer activity knowledge to the Ingenium platform and enhance the platform with interactive self learning Aim #2 will outfit the WSU smart apartment with the Ingenium system. The smart apartment has a complex set of 37 sensors. The Ingenium system will both simplify and enhance the WSU configuration by utilizing only 7 Ingenium room-masters. Twenty students will participate in a study to verify that the Ingenium system provides superior activity location and recognition than the current wired multiple motion sensor system. Aim #3 will test the ability of the enhanced interactive prompting and learning capability of the Ingenium system to learn the same activities without the knowledge transfer hence validating a real time learning activity recognizer is possible in a commercializable system. One of goals of Ingenium's business plan is to commercialize this system. .      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety.

"Longitudinal validity of accelerometry in youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the inception of parent grant (July 2007), pattern recognition approaches such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, and hidden Markov models have emerged as a viable and potentially more accurate alternative to traditional regression based cut-point methods. Whereas cut-point methods have proven to be modestly useful for broadly classifying the absolute intensity of physical activity, preliminary findings from the parent grant suggest that regression-based cut-point methods lack the accuracy required to provide valid point estimates of total and physical activity energy expenditure in field-based studies. Recently, pattern recognition approaches have been shown to be feasible and accurate using count data collected in 1-second increments by the widely used Actigraph accelerometer. The overarching goal of this competitive revision is to apply novel pattern recognition or machine learning data processing techniques to estimate physical activity type and intensity from high resolution accelerometer count data collected in children and adolescents as part of the ongoing parent grant. The proposed new aims are as follows: 1) To formulate and apply pattern recognition data processing techniques (multivariate hidden Markov models) to predict physical activity type and intensity from 1-second accelerometer count data collected in an age-diverse cohort children and adolescent; and 2) to compare the accuracy of physical activity intensity predictions provided by pattern recognition data processing techniques and traditional regression-based cut-point methods at baseline, and after 12-, 24-, and 36-months of follow-up.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents. Moreover, the new aims will inform the development of new computational approaches for predicting physical activity energy expenditure in free-living children and adolescents. This development will be particularly important for observational and experimental studies wishing to investigate the contributions of physical activity and sedentary behavior in the development and maintenance of childhood obesity.                Relevance to Public Health The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of smoking behavior.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

The device can provide the user and health professional feedback on the frequency of smoking and inhalation patterns (such as depth of inhalation and smoke holding) throughout the day in their home and community.

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7825424,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2010,185505,0.0893239014744183
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,0.07922315197549319
"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.",Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring,8053612,R43AG034698,"['Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer Interface', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Employee Strikes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Floor', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heel', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Noise', 'Nursing Homes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Medicine', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retirement', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Virginia', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wood material', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'comparative', 'cost', 'digital', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'gait examination', 'human subject', 'minimally invasive', 'operation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vibration', 'volunteer']",NIA,EMPIRICAL TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION,R43,2010,113956,0.004952693784563454
"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7847964,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nose', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2009,11376,0.02500977042654876

The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7537117,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Compatible', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,97690,0.02500977042654876
"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7287365,R44AG024687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Copyright', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Outsourcing', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Privacy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'network models', 'patient home care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2007,378793,0.004857802662355656

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7140644,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,182119,0.018797555767395797
"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7051911,R44AG024687,"['aging', 'artificial intelligence', 'assistive device /technology', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'caregivers', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'confidentiality', 'frail elderly', 'functional ability', 'home health care', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'monitoring device', 'outpatient care', 'quality of life', 'safety equipment', 'self care', 'technology /technique development']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2006,361154,0.004857802662355656
"Elective Surgery as a Teachable Moment for Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The term ""teachable moment"" refers to an event that motivates individuals to spontaneously adopt risk- reducing health behaviors. Events such as the diagnosis of smoking-related illnesses (e.g. cancer) and the scheduling of surgery spontaneously (i.e., in the absence of interventions) increase the rate of quitting. However, as recently discussed in an important conceptual paper by McBride et al, little is known about factors that make certain cueing events ""teachable"". They proposed a heuristic in which an event is a ""teachable moment"" for smoking cessation to the extent that it impacts 3 key constructs. Although appealing in concept, its validity has not been evaluated. The scheduling of surgery provides a unique opportunity to test the McBride model. This study will evaluate the McBride heuristic as applied to smoking behavior following elective surgical procedures. Two specific aims will be pursued. In the first we will develop measures of the Me Bride model specific to the surgical setting, and perform an initial evaluation of their stability and internal consistency in a group of surgical patients. In the second, we will perform a pilot study to explore the hypothesis that in patients scheduled for elective surgery: 1) higher perceptions of risks or greater negative expectancies regarding health outcomes related to smoking, 2) higher levels of positive or negative affective responses, and 3) self-concept or role expectations related to smoking will correlate with measures of self-efficacy and intent, and predict postoperative abstinence from smoking. Measures of the McBride constructs will be administered to smokers scheduled for elective surgery, whose smoking behavior will be evaluated for up to 30 days postoperatively. Structural equation modeling will be utilized both to validate the measurement model established in Aim 1 and to test the fit of the structural model associated with the McBride heuristic to postoperative smoking behavior. Relevance to public health: Evaluation of the McBride heuristic is of interest not only from a theoretical standpoint, but may have practical implications regarding the design of behavioral interventions to exploit the ""teachable moment. For example, if the constructs predict behavior, interventions can attempt to specifically influence these constructs. Our overall goal is to develop effective tobacco use interventions for surgical patients; this project will be an important step in this process.           n/a",Elective Surgery as a Teachable Moment for Smoking Cessation,7226537,R03CA126371,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior', 'clinical research', 'health', 'model', 'smoking', 'smoking cessation', 'surgery']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC,R03,2006,74000,0.03601038335514529
"An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a recognized need for specific and reliable information regarding the dose/response relationships between physical activity and health for all segments of the population. New methods for assessing physical activity and energy expenditure (EE) in free-living populations are needed before a systematic evaluation and interpretation of these dose-response relationships between physical activity and specific health-related results can be undertaken. Our objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, unobtrusive acceleration pattern acquisition and analysis system. This instrument will identify and quantify the physical activities that generate these patterns. At the end of this program, we will provide an intelligent system that is practical from both a cost and unobtrusive use prospective, thus making it an instrument of choice for epidemiologic physical activity studies of large free-living populations.           n/a",An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor,7107376,R43HD051014,"['actigraphy', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'body movement', 'body physical activity', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'cost effectiveness', 'exercise', 'human subject', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'miniature biomedical equipment', 'oxygen consumption', 'patient monitoring device', 'personal log /diary', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemetry', 'videotape /videodisc']",NICHD,"CREARE, INC.",R43,2006,122046,0.07883906935946705
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity.

"Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system that can automatically detect bouts of moderate or greater walking and deliver health behavior change information to users to increase their levels of physical activity will be developed and evaluated. The system will be an extension of work already performed by the investigators, and will incorporate a validated wireless motion sensor, pattern classification software to identify bouts of walking, and a personified, relational user interface designed to maintain engagement and trust in the tailored behavior change information delivered to users over multiple interactions. The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.       In the proposed effort the components of the PDA-based system will be developed, integrated and tested, and a randomized pilot study conducted to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the PDA-based behavior change intervention for increasing walking; 2) evaluate the effect of timeliness of health behavior change information on walking (time of need vs. retrospective); and 3) compare the efficacy of the personified user interface with that of a text-based interface for delivering health behavior change information on a PDA.      The proposed work will make significant contributions to several areas within the science of medical informatics, extending and integrating work in knowledge representation, bio-signal analysis, natural language processing, and consumer health informatics.

"A Personal Status Monitor for the Home The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The MA will primarily augment clinical service by making the line an effective place for rehabilitation. In addition, the PSM will have direct applicability to the field of ergonomics for work-site assessment, or in sports or recreational activities as a feedback device to facilitate training of skilled movements.

"COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS DESCRIPTION:  The project goal is to continue development of a practical, easily usable software system (SCSS) to assist physicians in providing smoking cessation counseling to their patients who smoke.  This system, begun under a SBIR Phase-I program, provides on-line, real-time assessment of a patient's smoking history, nicotine dependence, and relevant variables, produces a feedback report to the patient and provides treatment guidelines for physicians.  An efficacy study will be used to examine the relative utility of this system compared to a low-cost control in an A-B-A design.  It is anticipated that utilization of the SCSS system will 1) increase rates of physician intervention in smoking cessation, and 2) increase quit attempts and cessation among patients.  Testing will occur in an inner-city primary care clinic serving low income and ethnic minority individuals.  Testing at secondary sites across the US will enhance representation of diverse ethnic groups.  Focus groups will be conducted to obtain feedback from physicians and representatives of healthcare management organizations.

"A PERSONAL STATUS MONITOR FOR THE HOME We propose to develop and evaluate a wireless Personal Status Monitor (PSM) that can monitor the use of musculature in a continuous and unobstructive fashion while a subject performs normal and usual daily activities in the home. This innovation will provide the caregiver specific information describing their patient's physical and functional performance in the home, without relying on self-reports or having the patient leave the home environment. The PSM will consist of three components: I) wireless sensors to detect the electromyographic (BMG) signal, 2) a small body-worn transceiver, and 3) a base station, which processes the signals for feature extraction and transmission to the caregiver. The proposed Phase l program will focus on the development of methods to recognize specific functional tasks based solely on surface EMG signals. We propose to develop and evaluate pattern recognition algorithms using neural networks for processing EMG signals obtained from healthy subjects during the performance of specific functional tasks selected from the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Proof of concept will be achieved by demonstrating that it is possible to accurately distinguish between these tasks using no more than 4 EMG sensors, even when extraneous motor activity is present. The commercial development of a PSM for the home will be continued during Phase II by: 1) designing and building the hardware, 2) developing the application software, and 3) expanding the development of intelligent algorithms to additional functional activities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development of a new method for monitoring functional activity in the home. The innovation will rely on technological achievements involving wireless sensors and telemedicine to surpass the capability of current methods to measure functional activity in the home. It will replace, or augment, the current reliance on self-report questionnaires, non-specific physical activity monitors, and frequent home care or clinic visits to establish a patient record of physical activity in the home.

"CLINICAL RESEARCH TOWARD CLOSED LOOP INSULIN DELIVERY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The ""closed-loop                artificial pancreas,"" a device that would measure glucose level and              deliver insulin automatically as needed, has been an elusive goal in the         treatment of diabetes. There are three essential components: the blood           glucose sensor, linking algorithms and the delivery system. For the first        time, a viable sensor and a proven delivery system are now available for         research. The broad goal of this clinical research proposal is to complete       the studies needed to link the sensor to the delivery system, paving the         way for a functional closed-loop artificial pancreas. First, we will make        a detailed analysis of sensor signal as it reflects glucose level in             normal and diabetic humans. Second, we will study the precise                    pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery by external and implantable insulin         pumps. Third, analysis of these two data sets will provide the basis for         algorithms that link the sensor signal to insulin delivery. A formal             safety analysis will evaluate the safety features needed in a closed loop        device. In the last year of the project, the entire system will be tested        and fine-tuned. This project takes advantage of our relatively extensive         investigational experience with mechanical insulin delivery pumps in             people with diabetes, and the recent availability, for research, of a            subcutaneously placed, glucose oxidase-based continuous glucose sensor.          The investigators have established experienced with clinical research in         diabetes, and the resources of an excellent General Clinical Research            Center. The co-investigators have extensive experience with mathematical         modeling of biologic systems. There is a close working relationship              between the research team and the manufacturer of the sensor and pumps, as       reflected by the Interactive Research Project Grant collaboration, and by        a long-standing history of collaboration.

"COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS DESCRIPTION:  The project goal is to continue development of a practical, easily usable software system (SCSS) to assist physicians in providing smoking cessation counseling to their patients who smoke.  This system, begun under a SBIR Phase-I program, provides on-line, real-time assessment of a patient's smoking history, nicotine dependence, and relevant variables, produces a feedback report to the patient and provides treatment guidelines for physicians.  An efficacy study will be used to examine the relative utility of this system compared to a low-cost control in an A-B-A design.  It is anticipated that utilization of the SCSS system will 1) increase rates of physician intervention in smoking cessation, and 2) increase quit attempts and cessation among patients.  Testing will occur in an inner-city primary care clinic serving low income and ethnic minority individuals.  Testing at secondary sites across the US will enhance representation of diverse ethnic groups.  Focus groups will be conducted to obtain feedback from physicians and representatives of healthcare management organizations.  Results will be used to finalize the software system and prepare collateral materials necessary for commercial production. Traditionally underserved populations are targeted as they present a challenge for treatment in that these have limited resources and access to preventive care.  n/a",COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS,6072500,R44CA074624,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' interactive multimedia', ' smoking cessation', ' tobacco abuse', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,"BOCK TO THE FUTURE, INC",R44,2000,196068,0.01005111470352443
"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

"Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification About 6M Americans ≥65 years suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) which poses significant emotional, physical, and financial burden on patients and their families, and costs the US economy over $250 billion annually. AD/ADRD is a growing national public health crisis as the number of Americans ≥65 years is projected to double by 2050. There are no approved disease-modifying drugs for AD/ADRD, and no new symptom-modifying drug has been approved since 2003. This highlights the need for novel research approaches aimed at preventing AD/ADRD. Physical activity (PA) has been identified as the lifestyle intervention with the strongest potential to prevent AD/ADRD. However, most of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PA including the 23 ongoing RCTs currently sponsored by the NIA are small with short follow-up. Larger RCTs with longer follow-up are needed to provide definitive evidence of benefit. Identification of relevant biomarkers and quantification of future risk can mitigate long duration and cost of such RCTs. Epidemiologic studies with large database and long follow-up are limited by imprecise and unreliable self-reports of PA. We propose the novel concept of using cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a reliable biomarker of PA for AD/ADRD risk reduction. Like body composition, blood pressure and heart rate, CRF is considered a biomarker of PA. Just as well-controlled blood glucose leads to optimal HbA1C, PA of adequate duration, frequency and intensity also leads to optimal CRF. The current application has been designed to test the hypotheses that higher CRF is independently linked to a lower risk of incident AD/ADRD and to determine optimal levels of CRF assessed by a standardized exercise tolerance test (ETT), for minimizing AD/ADRD risk at both population and individual levels. Our Specific Aims are (1) to determine the relationship between CRF and incident AD/ADRD, taking into consideration a non-linear relationship and potential interactions of CRF with other risk factors and (2) to define incremental CRF levels that are linked to progressively lower risk of AD/ADRD, overall, and in subgroups by age, sex, and race. Our Aim 3 is to develop and validate a deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine the optimal CRF level for individuals to achieve the lowest risk of AD/ADRD. Recent advances in deep (machine) learning, a key artificial intelligence (AI) technology, allow modeling of complex non-linear relationships necessary for more precise risk prediction. These aims will be achieved by using ETT data on 911,698 Veterans free of baseline AD/ADRD (mean age, 61 years, 54,411 women, 202,000 African American, 50,107 Hispanic Americans) with up to 19 years of follow-up data. Explainable deep learning risk prediction model will be developed in the VA data, and validated with a Medicare population to develop a “precision medicine” approach that will personalize CRF recommendations for individuals to lower their AD/ADRD risk. Future studies will incorporate molecular biomarkers to validate AD diagnosis and ascertain effect of CRF and CRF modification on AD risk. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) affects about 6 million Americans ≥65 years but to date there are no drug that can cure it and no new drug to improve memory and function has been discovered in nearly past two decades. Physical activity is the only lifestyle intervention with the greatest potential to prevent AD/ADRD, but clinical trials of physical activity are often small with short follow-up, and self-reports of physical activity in observation studies are unreliable. We propose to use objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a biomarker of physical activity in the largest epidemiological study to date in nearly 1 million Veterans using VA’s world-class electronic health record and advanced artificial intelligence technologies.",Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification,10055393,RF1AG069121,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart Rate', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Prevention trial', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sample Size', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'lifestyle intervention', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical learning', 'systematic review', 'unstructured data']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2005396,0.007441658096757949
"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9883770,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2020,87670,0.042775746097464
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9829561,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2020,165045,0.009041877869729013
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,9995331,R01CA247156,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antismoking', 'Car Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Cost Measures', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Health behavior change', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social support', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Trust', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized effectiveness trial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'web site']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,730398,0.03226334157734397
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10131449,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'combat', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2020,457208,0.029142871380326372
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10131376,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2020,1992588,-0.03561269870957528
"Dense Life-log Health Analytics from Wearable Sensors using Functional Analysis and Riemannian Geometry Project Summary The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled lifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace.

"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future. Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s affects millions of individuals, at a great cost to public health and personal well-being. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in- person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access.

"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,0.05302119877887192
"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Immobilization', 'Implant', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Older Population', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Skin Temperature', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sports Medicine', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Swelling', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'healing', 'high risk', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'physical therapist', 'post-operative rehabilitation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'rotator cuff tear', 'sensor', 'success', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'wireless communication']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,0.01520113595398217
"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dietitian', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hyperphagia', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'design', 'drinking', 'image processing', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication nonadherence', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'privacy preservation', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,0.029826429987036687
"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency).

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10019477,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,200000,0.031102754467115454
"Continuous Monitoring of COVID-19 Symptomatology for Elderly Patients in Long Term Care Facilities Using Advanced, Soft, and Flexible Sensors Mounted on the Suprasternal Notch PROJECT SUMMARY: COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly1 with the greatest risk in those cared for in long-term care facilities (LTCs) where mortality rates range from 19% to 72% worldwide. Monitoring COVID-19 infections in LTCs remains a particular challenging. The existing and a continued expected shortage of sufficient molecular COVID-19 testing coupled to false negative rates as high as 15% necessitates a critical need for new and complementary technologies that can surveil, alert, and track COVID-19 infections in this population. Our group are pioneers in the development of novel soft electronics. Our recent publication, supported by our active Phase I STTR, was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering detailing a next generation ultra-low profile, soft, and flexible sensor (ADAM) that continuously measures subtle acousto- mechanic signals generated by the body via an embedded high-frequency, 3-axis accelerometer in direct mechanical communication with the skin. The ADAM sensor communicates via Bluetooth with our custom mobile application for real time streaming as well as on sensor data storage enabling stand-alone operation. All data streams are cloud synchronized (HIPAA compliant). The highly novel soft, flexible nature allows for the ADAM sensor to be mountable on unusual locations of high information density. Specifically, we exploit the SN—the only location on the body where there is no dampening effect at the skin level with the intrathoracic cavity. This enables a SN- mounted ADAM sensor to capture heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature, physical activity (PA), swallow count, and talk time, along with additional novel respiratory biomarkers relevant to COVID-19. In this proposal, we propose to develop a new COVID-19 software package, machine learning enhancements to our cough algorithm, and validation in LTCs with both elderly patients and staff to evaluate usability, feasibility, and adherence. The high level of technology readiness with partner LTCs allows us to deploy efficiently to generate essential data for a future FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our team of experts in engineering, dermatology, gerontology, and machine learning are highly qualified to develop this COVID-19 surveillance system that offers both commercial and clinical value with broad applicability to a wide range of other respiratory and chronic medical conditions after the pandemic subsides. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly resident in long-term care facilities.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9990732,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,623237,0.011672097394329521
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,0.02642361181170507
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9851750,R01MD010362,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavior change', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'contextual factors', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'disability', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,849960,0.05287976790360687
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI.

The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,10142163,R01DK122473,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Elderly', 'Energy Intake', 'Feedback', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthy Eating', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastication', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'healthy weight', 'increased appetite', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'sucking', 'synergism', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'weight maintenance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2020,58911,0.013822898018613592
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9924432,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,298890,0.0357883926039705
"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys. Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent developments in mobile technology suggest new and innovative ways to deliver effective smoking cessation treatments. This project will test the feasibility of using a smartband to automatically monitor and detect smoking and deliver real time mindfulness interventions via smartphone app to reduce smoking.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9994897,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,41640,0.03099955214617312
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9938564,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,355478,0.0718566673579049
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9899101,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,572773,0.06504655916003314

"A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018 and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that 30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21 phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit- partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the findings will have a system wide sustainable impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe, with applications to the US and other populations. The research is also expected to have an important impact on the methodology and design of mobile technology clinical and public health interventions during the reproductive years with lifelong potential implications. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help enhance health and reduce the burdens of human illness.",A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support,10057086,R21HD103039,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eastern Europe', 'Effectiveness', 'Friends', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Romania', 'Self Determination', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Spouses', 'Stress', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'craving', 'design', 'iterative design', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peer support', 'pilot trial', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal cigarette smoking', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'reproductive', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,1000,0.017935666247409523
"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[' '],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,-0.011391821583092817
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,0.01031735489926969
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9840897,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2020,4401725,0.06289180695088598
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9830682,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,100000,-0.009937816035126524
"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,9909179,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,610247,0.01779625913127226
"Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology Abstract  In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state- of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Although results were promising, the majority of participants still did not meet national guidelines for PA. In the ongoing renewal of R01CA159954, we will randomize 300 Latina women to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention).  The proposed supplement seeks to become the first trial to examine longitudinal patterns of PA adoption and maintenance across a series of longitudinal studies among Latinas. Traditional analytic methods would compare findings across studies and would estimate intervention effects at end of treatment controlling for baseline. We propose to use Integrative Data Analysis to combine data across studies and Latent Class Models to identifies patterns of PA adoption and maintenance. By using Latent Class Modeling (LCM), we will make full use of the longitudinal profile of PA data to identify patterns of change over time. LCMs use objective data (rather than a priori hypotheses) to subdivide the population into distinct groups of participants with similar profiles (of PA changes in this case). LCM can not only capture between- and within-subject heterogeneity, but can aid in the identification of meaningful subgroups within the population. By using this innovative method, we will not only reveal the inter-variability of PA over time but also elucidate the associations between such patterns and key psychosocial, behavioral and demographic predictors. Project Narrative Latinas exhibit high rates of inactivity and related chronic health conditions (including some cancers, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and are therefore in need of culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity interventions. The proposed supplement will build on the aims of the parent and renewal studies by using integrative data analysis to identify patterns of change in objectively measured physical activity over time, and test how these patterns relate to participant-level characteristics, including demographics, psychosocial and physiological predictors.",Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology,9764734,R01CA159954,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Endometrial', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latina', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'burden of illness', 'cancer risk', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'exercise intervention', 'group intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'post intervention', 'protective effect', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social culture', 'success', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigorous intensity']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,216895,0.059017320846755005
"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,10011784,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,312701,0.017737651502951462
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation.

"Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates Summary/Abstract Each year, about 5-18% of babies are born preterm, accounting for over 0.5M births in the US and 15M globally. Many of these babies are admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) where the medical staff generally have the option of using either invasive arterial lines (IALs) or inflatable-cuff non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. The former introduces the risk of infection, tissue and nerve damage, and the latter is less accurate, especially for hypotensive infants, and may add the risk of ischemic and nerve damage upon repeated measurement. There is a clear need for a safer, continuous, and cost effective form of NIBP measurement to meet the challenge of managing unhealthy blood pressures for neonates. PyrAmes Inc. has developed a novel capacitive sensor technology that is paper thin and flexible and can accurately detect blood pressure (BP). This sensor technology is part of a unique continuous BP monitoring platform that provides accurate, lightweight and comfortable BP monitoring in a wireless, wrist-worn package that is easy to use. The system uses lightweight neural networks to analyze pulse waveform data to provide continuous determination of systolic, diastolic, and mean BP, heart rate, and their variabilities. The sensor is easy to apply non-invasively and records pulsatile data similar to an arterial line, while avoiding the difficulties of placing and maintaining an arterial line. This device can provide gold standard BP monitoring without perturbing the patients for more accurate and relevant measurements. The objective of this project is to extend the platform for use with term and pre-term neonates. This goal will be accomplished through redesign of the sensor hardware and optimization of the data analytics software. We will validate these modifications with clinical data from the NICU at Stanford University Medical Center. In Phase I, we will miniaturize the electronics and modify the sensor array of a wrist-worn pulse wave monitor to be sized more appropriately for neonates. We will validate the new device design by collecting NICU clinical data from patients who have IALs in place in an IRB-approved study. From IAL and sensor data taken simultaneously, we will determine ground truth values on a pulse-by-pulse basis and use these data in conjunction with additional IAL data from historical databases to improve our sensor quality and predictive BP models. Our success metric will be to equal or exceed the quality and accuracy of our data for adults. Phase II will be a follow-up IRB-approved pivotal study using the device from Phase 1 to position our device for FDA submission and clearance and scale up to pilot production of this device. Project Narrative The goal of this Phase 1 project is to confirm that machine learning can be used to extract blood pressure values for critically ill neonates from pulse waveform data collected with a wearable, non-invasive device that is comfortable, low-cost and easy to use. The proposed device will significantly reduce the need for frequent cuff-based measurements and/or invasive arterial lines, thereby decreasing morbidity, risk of complications, patient discomfort, and overall cost of care. This project is based on the pioneering efforts of Prof. Zhenan Bao’s lab at Stanford on thin film sensors for electronic skin and includes the design and use of a miniaturized device to collect clinical data from neonates that will be used to validate a model which derives blood pressure values from the pulse waveform without external calibration.",Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates,9910153,R43HD101175,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Area', 'Arterial Lines', 'Birth', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood pressure determination', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Coin', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronics', 'Female', 'Film', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Nerve', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Pain', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'encryption', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'light weight', 'male', 'miniaturize', 'neonate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pressure', 'preterm newborn', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'success', 'tonometry']",NICHD,"PYRAMES, INC.",R43,2020,224556,0.016241578479014158
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9934148,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2020,2195573,-0.0009377586525184774
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9732635,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'pedometer', 'physical model', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,183406,0.024103794605953886
"Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to characterize biomarkers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in heavy users. Marijuana and tobacco smoking are both prevalent among HIV+ populations, but their individual and combined impacts on inflammation and cardiovascular risk are unknown. Preliminary studies using longitudinal data from a prospective cohort showed that chronic heavy marijuana smoking has no significant effect on HIV disease markers, but is associated with increased rates of incident cardiovascular events in ART-treated HIV+ men age 40-60 independently of tobacco smoking and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, we showed that heavy marijuana and/or tobacco smoking was associated with elevated WBC and neutrophil counts, immune activation, inflammation, and vascular injury in ART-treated HIV+ smokers. We hypothesize that specific combustion products in marijuana and tobacco smoke, including acrolein, other reactive aldehydes, and VOCs, can induce proinflammatory responses mediated through activated neutrophils and monocytes that promote chronic inflammation in ART-treated adults, contributing to cardiovascular risk by promoting lipid peroxidation, coagulation, vascular inflammation, and endothelial injury, while attenuating protective responses. We further hypothesize that these effects are additive upon dual exposure to both marijuana and tobacco smoke and augmented by HIV infection. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well- characterized longitudinal HIV+ cohorts to characterize marijuana smoke exposure biomarkers in plasma and urine samples and their relationship to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models to explain the effects of specific constituents of marijuana smoke on inflammatory pathways, and how these pathways are modified in the setting of HIV infection. These studies will provide information that helps to explain chronic inflammation and elevated cardiovascular risk in ART-treated HIV+ adults, safety profiles of smoked cannabinoids, and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to characterize markers of marijuana smoke exposure in ART-treated HIV+ adults over age 40, and their relationship to inflammation and vascular injury in chronic heavy users. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which smoked marijuana can impact inflammation and health outcomes in HIV+ individuals, and provide new information related to safety profiles of cannabinoids and development of therapeutic interventions.",Effects of marijuana use on inflammation and vascular injury in adults with HIV infection,9883769,R01DA046203,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Acrolein', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aldehydes', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Antioxidants', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Endothelium', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Immunologic Markers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxic effect', 'Urine', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'combustion product', 'comorbidity', 'immune activation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'marijuana smoke', 'marijuana use', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'monocyte', 'network models', 'neutrophil', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tobacco exposure', 'transcriptome', 'vascular inflammation', 'vascular injury', 'volatile organic compound']",NIDA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,648591,-0.005847512722036188
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an integrated health coaching system that uses a smartphone app to promote healthy behaviors.
