"Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks Project Summary/Abstract: There is significant current interest in understanding how neurons relate to whole-brain networks and how these networks coordinate to give rise to behavior. We have recently shown that we can decompose Local Field Potential voltage signals recorded from depth electrodes implanted in multiple brain regions into “electrical functional connectomes,” or electomes, which empirically are consistent between individuals in a population and are predictive of behavior. This provides a unique opportunity to use these consistent network properties to anchor and stratify neurons based on their relationship to whole-brain network dynamics, and this approach only uses data that is currently collected or could be collected with minor changes in protocol. This stratification will be consistent across animals, allowing examination of how neurons in different brains relate to whole-brain networks and to behaviors. This will facilitate closer examination of neuron activity by allowing stronger data aggregation across subjects. Neural encoding and decoding models will be required to be faithful at both the individual neuron level and the multi-region voltage dynamic level, constraining neural relationships by known and learned biological properties. This will be accomplished by first building upon our explainable machine learning approach for learning multi-region networks by including historical data to improve the utility of machine learning during pilot studies and creating novel stochastic optimization approaches for real-time mapping of observed data into the networks. Then, we will develop a model capable of embedding neurons into a shared space, where the embedding succinctly reveals how a neuron relates to the electomes. Finally, these vector embeddings will be used to relate neurons to both behavior and the multi-region dynamics in both single-trial and repeated-trial behavioral tasks. Remarkably, a neuron’s embedding and the state of the mesoscale networks can predict the neural encoding a priori to observing behavior and neural firing simultaneously in a new subject. The overarching goal of this proposal is to learn how neurons’ action potentials, long considered to be a fundamental unit of information, relate to whole-brain spatiotemporal voltage patterns and behavior. To uncover this relationship, we will develop novel computational methods capable of learning networks that relate voltage signals from multiple brain regions based upon our previously developed explainable machine learning approach. These networks will then be used to stratify neurons into subtypes consistent across a population of subjects to facilitate the statistical aggregation of data to uncover relationships between multiple scale of neural activity and behavior.",Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks,9775689,R01EB026937,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral trial', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'connectome', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'member', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'voltage']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,775000,0.07571536439399698
"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics.

"Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the first regions in the brain to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, and is important for object recognition, odor discrimination and episodic memory. Hence, early AD symptoms such as misplacing objects, forgetting events and loss of smell could be due to LEC dysfunction. In order to understand how Aβ and tau accumulation impacts the LEC neurons, we will use two mouse models of AD: APP knockin (APP-KI) mice- expressing physiological levels of APP and EC- APP/Tau mice- expressing elevated levels of APP and tau in the EC. Both mouse models show selectively vulnerability in the LEC, making them ideal candidates to probe LEC function. Our preliminary data shows behavioral impairment in the EC-APP/Tau mice at 24 months and data on APP-KI show impairment at 18 months. In the proposal we will evaluate LEC function in the younger mice in order to detect neuronal changes prior to behavioral deficits. We will record LEC activity with silicon probes and test responses towards objects, odors and passage of time. Using computational approach such as machine learning, we will determine if ensemble properties of LEC neurons are affected by tau and Aβ. We hypothesize that APP in the LEC of APP-KI mice will make the neurons dysfunctional which will be evident with poor decoding accuracy for objects, odors and temporal epochs. In the EC-APP/Tau mice, combined effect of Aβ and tau will make the dysfunction worse and affect the decoding accuracy further allowing better prediction of early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The proposal brings together diverse fields (electrophysiology, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques to record ensemble populations of neurons and develop analytical and predictive computational tests to interrogate function in a vulnerable brain region that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease. Inability to smell odors, misplacing items and confusion with events are some of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and pathology in the lateral entorhinal cortex of the brain could be the major cause for these early symptoms. By using sophisticated electrophysiological techniques and computational analysis, we will investigate the neurons of the lateral entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease mice and predict disease onset before cognitive symptoms appear.",Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning,9891510,R21AG066168,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Silicon', 'Smell Perception', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Perception', 'Training', 'abeta accumulation', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'computational neuroscience', 'digital', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'in vivo', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mouse model', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'object recognition', 'response', 'sugar', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,-0.036062567551560926
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9792299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'computational basis', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,665648,0.006936038869562405
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9798264,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'axonal guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'programs', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,384007,0.04375127661709924
"Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the natural acoustic environment. They adapt their hearing to emphasize the features of sound that are important for making behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. A better understanding of the function of the healthy and impaired auditory system will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will develop computational tools to study central auditory processing. A software library will support fitting and evaluating a large number of encoding models to describe the functional relationship between a time-varying natural auditory stimulus and the corresponding neural response. Many such models have been proposed, but relatively few direct comparisons have been made between them. This project will enable their comparison, allowing identification of the key features that contribute positively to their performance. The system will have a modular design so that useful elements from different models can be combined into comprehensive models with even greater explanatory power. The software will be open source and will support data from multiple recording modalities, including small-scale single unit electrophysiological and calcium imaging data, as well as large-scale local field and magnetoencephalography data. In addition to building on existing hypotheses about neural coding, the system will support machine learning methods for fitting artificial neural network models using the same datasets. These large, data-driven models have proven valuable for wide ranging signal processing problems, but their value and relation to existing models for neural sensory processing remain to be explored. Sensory processing involves coherent activity of large neural populations. To study coding at the population level, the system will support models that characterize the simultaneous activity of multiple neural signals and identifies latent subspaces of population activity related to sound encoding. Sensory coding is also influenced by behavioral context, reflecting changes in behavioral demands and the more general environment. The system will incorporate behavioral state variables into models, where encoding properties can be modulated by changes in behavioral context. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the neural populations in the healthy brain represent complex natural sounds. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales,9774688,R01EB028155,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual system structure', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'computerized tools', 'data format', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open source', 'receptive field', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIBIB,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,794000,0.03305739984376002
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Quantifying causality for neuroscience Abstract: Causality is central to neuroscience. For example, we might ask about the causal effect of a neuron on another neuron, or its influence on perception, action, or cognition. Moreover, any medical approaches aim at producing a causal effect – effecting improvements for patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to establish causality, but they are not always practical. For example, while we can electrically or optogenetically activate entire areas, large-scale targeted stimulation of individual neurons is hard. Other ways of establishing causality are problematic: if we observe a correlation it is hard to know its cause. The problem is confounding: there are variables that we do not record that affect the variables we do. This also renders model comparisons problematic – a causally wrong model with few parameters may well fit the observed data better than a causally correct one with many parameters. We thus need data analysis tools that allow authoritatively asking causal questions without the need for random perturbation experiments.  Just like neuroscience now, the field of econometrics once focused on correlations. But since the 1980s, empirical economics has undergone a so-called credibility revolution, requiring the development of rigorous methods to establish causality. Several successful methods have emerged to become the workhorses of empirical economics. The idea underlying these methods is that if one can observe variables that approximate random perturbations, then one can still discover causal relations. This is what economists call a quasi-experiment. We here propose to carry over such quasi-experimental techniques to neuroscience. For example in neuroscience, if there is a random variable that affects only one neuron, then any activity in other neurons correlated with that variable must be causally affected by the neuron. Another famous quasi- experimental method is regression discontinuity design (RDD). This approach effectively uses the noise introduced at the threshold to identify causal relations. Importantly, such techniques have, thanks to decades of research in econometrics, very well understood statistical properties. These approaches promise to considerably enrich the approaches towards causality we have in neuroscience. We have a strong interdisciplinary team, spanning economics, experimental, and computational neuroscience, collaborating on adapting these quasi-experimental techniques to problems in neuroscience through a combination of machine learning and domain-specific engineering. This promises to be a major advance relative to current techniques that generally approach causality in neuroscience through model comparison. Project Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop a set of computational techniques that allow neuroscientists to quantify how neurons causally influence one another. To do so, it utilizes approaches popular in econometrics called quasiexperiments. Such approaches to quantify causality is important as medical perturbations of brains, e.g. treatments of epilepsy or depression are aimed at effecting or causing a change in the brain.",Quantifying causality for neuroscience,9775861,R01EB028162,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'optogenetics', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,803000,0.017797510031575134
"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease. There is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopy (EM) and correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy data. The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.  The reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutions. There is a strong need for next generation, well supported, integrated, easy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neurons, trace arbor branches, identify synapses, spines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time-consuming analyses in connectomic experiments. There is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data-driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discovery.  Powered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Rachel Wong and 9 additional labs, this project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysis (ICA) tool optimized for dense neuronal circuits. The tool will be commercially supported and integrated with DRVision’s flagship product Aivia to (1) provide accurate and automated neuron tracing in 3D EM and 3D fluorescence data up to multi-terabytes, (2) identify pre- and post-synaptic dendrite segments, (3) correlate light and electron microscopy data, quantify and classify neurons and sub-cellular components, (4) extract and analyze neuron circuits, (5) provide tools for phenotype discoveries, (6) seamlessly integrate the pipeline of ground truth (GT) annotation, editing, and machine learning workflow, and (7) access the required computing infrastructure, database connection, and exchange of data with other tools.

"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,9871513,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,134007,0.03050996197285766
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,9765324,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,254496,0.024294446971007546
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9730628,R01NS091421,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,381916,0.05143605220589121
"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9775212,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,628430,0.05359323301273768
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9695015,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,350000,0.03564256634830056
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9835325,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2019,99879,0.019876312585955253
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9730639,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,205290,0.022020879889683376
"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system — and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics — to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,9814744,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2019,2774000,0.021949778571439874
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9665785,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,403711,0.05721955229456822
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9775220,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2019,2994145,0.03506685910112831
"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9803507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,334599,-0.033404844789875036
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9735214,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'summer internship', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,268961,0.010903121085598275
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9625167,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,526760,0.018032507706743577
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9707904,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,446302,0.013409141993259432
"Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors,9744432,K99MH117264,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Housing', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hunger', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'generalized anxiety', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2019,110754,0.01933620295158452
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9654850,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dimensions', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2019,455655,0.023532770172888826
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis.

"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown.

Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9998384,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,68977,0.09045202335419915
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9676583,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,0.0334856033348105
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9805996,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,129087,0.047518186312899606
"Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease In early phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) only specific types of neurons are affected by pathological lesions. As the disease progresses, additional neurons types gradually start expressing signs of pathology and degeneration throughout the brain. A major obstacle to treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective neuronal vulnerability. Neurons from the layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the most vulnerable neurons of the brain, but there are currently no in vitro culture system for these neurons, preventing both an in-depth analysis of genes involved in neuronal vulnerability, and the search for drugs inhibiting early neurodegeneration affecting these neurons. In the parent RF1 grant, we proposed to identify transcription factors (TFs) involved in specifying ECII neuron identity, using both detailed molecular profiles for ECII and control neurons, which we generated at different points of their development, and cutting-edge functional genomics analyses. These TFs will then be used to drive the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into ECII neurons. While iPSCs provide a versatile platform that can be differentiated into many different neuron types, concerns have been raised that neurons derived from iPSCs are biologically very young, as the iPSC generation protocol “resets” the biological clock of a cell. AD-associated lesions are age-dependent, and we think that an in vitro paradigm adapted to this study of aging is crucial. In this administrative supplement, we thus want to adapt this iPSC protocol for the direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts, using the TFs identified in the parent grant. Directly reprogrammed fibroblasts are not reset biologically and present a biological age that correlates with the age of the fibroblast donor. After having optimized a protocol for direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into ECII neurons, we will provide a proof of concept that these ECII neurons are a good model for probing selective neuronal vulnerability by studying Tau pathology in neurons reprogrammed from fibroblasts of aging donors and of donors with AD mutations. Overall these ECII neurons directly reprogrammed from fibroblasts would be the first in vitro model for the study of the interplay between selective neuronal vulnerability in AD and aging. In Alzheimer’s diseases (AD), only certain regions of the brain are initially affected, followed later by more wide-ranging degeneration. In our parent grant, we proposed to establish the first cell culture system to model the neurons that are most vulnerable in AD, using stem cells. It was recently shown that culture systems involving stem cells generate cells that are young biologically, and not perfectly suited for the study of age- associated degeneration. We now propose to modify our initial protocol using “fibroblast direct reprogramming”, a protocol that does not involve stem cells, and that yields cells than can be biologically much older. This cell culture system would allow AD researchers to investigate, for the first time, the interaction between age and neuronal vulnerability to AD.",Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease,9791605,RF1AG054564,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cells', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Fibroblasts', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Grant', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research Personnel', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stem cells', 'Study models', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'abeta accumulation', 'age related', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'aged', 'entorhinal cortex', 'functional genomics', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'mutant', 'neurofibrillary tangle formation', 'overexpression', 'parent grant', 'presenilin-1', 'prevent', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tau Proteins', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor S-II', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIA,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,423750,-0.016508080643934296
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9634046,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,327250,0.04323130682927429
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9818745,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1164920,0.026042874643777046
"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice.

"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,9685191,R01EY011787,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amblyopia', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'cell type', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'photoactivation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-photon', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,394825,0.053219665315971866
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation. Discovery in this area can  help improve understanding of neurologic disorders and development of new stimulation therapies. n/a",CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits,9916954,R01NS115327,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Closure by clamp', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventroposterior Medial Nucleus of the Thalamus', 'Vibrissae', 'awake', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'technology development', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,325241,0.02667350418957176
"Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to develop a widely adoptable, high-throughput, functional connectomics platform to semi-automatically reconstruct and analyze the synaptic connectivity of functionally characterized neuronal microcircuits. We will develop this pipeline in the context of understanding neural microcircuits that control walking, using the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) as a model system. The VNC constitutes over a third of the fly central nervous system, and functions like the spinal cord to control movement and sensation of the limbs. It has a tractable number of neurons (~60,000), many of which are genetically identified and anatomically stereotyped, making it an excellent brain region for developing a comprehensive approach to characterize neuronal circuits. Our approach will integrate several technologies from our labs, including in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in walking flies, high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (EM), automated, deep- learning based connectomic reconstruction, and cell morphology-based analytics. Using this pipeline we will generate the first dense functional connectomes of the VNC, including the sensorimotor leg circuitry from multiple male and female flies. We will use these data to test the hypothesis that there exist specific patterns of synaptic connectivity between functional subtypes of leg proprioceptors and motor neurons. By creating the first connectomes of a microcircuit that orchestrates walking behavior, we anticipate this project will provide new and fundamental insight into the circuit basis of sensorimotor transformation and motor control. It will also create an important resource for the Drosophila and neuroscience communities, through publicly available tools and datasets that integrate connectivity, morphology, and cellular physiology data. Moreover, the technical approaches we develop for high-throughput functional connectomics can be readily applied to other brain regions and across species. Project Narrative Detailed mapping of neural computations and the neuronal circuits that underlie them is crucial for a comprehensive understanding central nervous system function in health and disease. Our goal is to develop an accessible, high-throughput pipeline of tools that we will use to dissect the relationship between neuronal connectivity and function in circuits that control walking. We will focus on sensorimotor transformations in the tractable genetic model organism Drosophila to dissect fundamental principles of proprioceptive feedback in motor control, while improving the speed and accessibility of functional connectomics for the broader scientific community.",Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics,9822460,RF1MH117808,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrical Synapse', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System control', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Property', 'Proprioceptor', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Walking', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fly', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'light microscopy', 'male', 'motor control', 'motor neuron function', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sex', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'two-photon']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2019,4347595,0.037777585277743476
"Multi-region 'Network of Networks' Recurrent Neural Network Models of Adaptive and Maladaptive Learning The massive neural activity data collected through transformative new technologies present an incredible opportunity in facilitating the mission of the BRAIN Initiative and the wider neuroscience community: to understand brain function. However, the analysis and interpretation of these massive datasets represent a bottleneck for computational models and theories, which traditionally simulate brain areas as modules in isolation, rather than as interacting, intercommunicating neural circuit ensembles. We propose to eliminate this bottleneck through the development of powerful new, scalable multi-region neural network models and analysis tools that will enable discovery of the connectivity and circuit mechanisms within and between brain regions. We will build off of the advantages of, and our prior successes with, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the state-of-the-art for modeling time-varying behaviors. Specifically, we propose to develop and test a new class of multi-region “network of networks” RNNs to model the nested, hierarchical computations occurring across multiple interacting brain regions during complex behavior. These models will provide another advantage over existing models in being trained to match experimental data from the outset, and using the dynamics of learning to reveal effective connectivity, comprising both network structures and communication principles. The entire pipeline—training and testing the multi-region models and analysis steps for real and simulated data—is scalable and modular, enabling our community of collaborators and end-users to reproduce, validate, and even customize it. Finally, the models, methods, and theories developed are aimed as extensible deliverables. They will lead to widely disseminable new extensions for probing the circuit mechanisms of inter-area communication during both functional and dysfunctional states, and bridging together several experimental observations and model systems. The specific aims of the project include a number of critical subprojects focused on: first, developing multi- region RNN models of adaptive learning, initially focusing on the use case of adversity evasion by zebrafish; and second, modeling circuit dysfunctions in maladaptive learning, the use case being learned immobility in the face of inescapable, persistent adversity. Third, in parallel, this project will scale up and expand the range of the multi-region models and tools for inferring effective connectivity to larger, yet less-sampled datasets, and disseminate them to a community of collaborative end-users. The proposed multi-region RNN models and analytical tools have the potential to be widely used in the neuroscience community to dissect features of brain function in both health and disease. Moreover, our resultant theoretical frameworks will have a strong influence on fundamental approaches to understanding neuroscience data and will inform experimental paradigms and drive future data collection. Transformative new technologies now capture neural activity from thousands of single neurons across multiple areas and even whole brains with sub-second resolution. These methods are critical facilitators for the BRAIN initiative and the wider neuroscience community. However, they produce large-scale datasets whose analysis and interpretation represent a bottleneck for computational models and theories, which traditionally simulate brain areas as modules in isolation, rather than as interacting, intercommunicating neural circuits. We will develop powerful new, scalable multi-region neural network models and analysis tools for eliminating this bottleneck, opening up new avenues for probing circuit mechanisms within and between brain regions in both health and disease.",Multi-region 'Network of Networks' Recurrent Neural Network Models of Adaptive and Maladaptive Learning,9775964,R01EB028166,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'adaptive learning', 'analytical tool', 'behavioral response', 'cohesion', 'coping', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,879000,0.010470371994987656
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9673799,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2019,553859,0.029366470372220472
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9789318,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,7509,0.0479452371852156
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9778913,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2019,3062362,0.04184449233729107

"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. Project Summary Synapses between neurons are plastic – able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an “error signal” that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers are other cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circuit uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorders, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local “decisions” cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit’s function over multiple time scales.

"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9797408,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,337875,-0.013807454146843711

"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9748637,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,480336,0.032266450348767226
"CRCNS: Real-time neural decoding for calcium imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Chen, Rong PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Real-time neural decoding centers on predicting behavior variables based on neural activity data, where the prediction is performed at a pace that reliably keeps up with the speed of the activity that is being monitored. Neuromodulation devices are becoming one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of brain disorders, enhancing neurocognitive performance, and demonstrating causality (Bergmann et al., 2016; Knotkova and Rasche, 2015). A precise neuromodulation system (Figure 1) integrates neural activity monitoring, real-time neural decoding, and neuromodulation. In precise neuromodulation, a decoding device predicts a behavior variable based on neural data streams in real-time. Based on the decoding results, neuromodulation parameters such as timing, frequency, duration, and amplitude are changed. Precise neuromodulation systems with closed-loop real-time feedback are superior to the fixed (open- loop) neuromodulation paradigm (Brocker et al., 2017; deBettencourt et al., 2015; Ezzyat et al., 2017). A recent direct brain stimulation study (Ezzyat et al., 2017) demonstrated significant advantages of precise neuromodulation over open-loop neuromodulation. Ezzyat et al. applied direct brain stimulation with decoding capability to patients with epilepsy to improve their memory. They found that stimulation increased memory function only if delivered when the decoding device indicated low encoding efficiency while stimulation decreased memory function if delivered when the decoding device indicated high encoding efficiency. An open-loop neuromodulation system with a fixed stimulation paradigm may not always facilitate memory function.  Miniature cellular imaging (Ghosh et al., 2011; Kerr and Nimmerjahn, 2012; Scott et al., 2013) is one of the most powerful ways to study neural circuits. It enables us to investigate neural circuits during behaviors for an understanding of network architecture of behavior, cognition, and emotion. Miniature cellular imaging records neuronal activity at cellular and sub-second levels of spatial and temporal resolution in freely moving animals. Miniature cellular imaging has many advantages. First, compared with in vivo multi-electrode recording, miniature calcium imaging can probe all cells in the field of view, and visualize the spatial location of monitored cells (Kerr et al., 2005). Second, compared with magnetic resonance imaging, which measures brain activity at the macroscopic scale and with low temporal resolution, miniature cellular imaging provides high spatial and temporal resolution. Third, fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2014) lacks cellular-level resolution, while miniature cellular imaging allows concurrent tracking of neural calcium activities at cellular spatial resolution.

"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,9872014,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2019,126090,0.05823045831470087
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,9830975,F31NS113385,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Endoscopes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Stereotyping', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'calcium indicator', 'complement pathway', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'indexing', 'microendoscopy', 'miniaturize', 'optogenetics', 'study population', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,38342,0.017642779794393666
"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes.

"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9775436,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,279706,0.06801874928456599
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9764342,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,34022,-0.006110867858861553
"Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit Project Summary/Abstract We have recently published a 3D electron microscopy volume of the whole fruit fly brain. However mapping of synaptic `wiring diagrams' or connectomes of neuronal circuits from this volume is currently completely manual and therefore slow. Our long-term goal is to increase understanding of how circuits process and transform information, both by accelerating connectomics mapping, and increasing the power and accessibility of analysis tools. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) provide newly available whole-brain segmentations to the user community, by extending the widely used, web-based circuit-mapping and analysis platform, CATMAID; and (ii) develop, validate, and apply new analysis tools for delivering insight into circuit structure. These objectives will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Deploy automatic segmentations to a CATMAID server where members of the fly neurobiology community can create and manage their own collaborative projects; 2) Provide integrated, scalable, and cross-modal software for analysis of connectomes and neurogeometry; and 3) Complete proof-of-principle projects using this infrastructure, including the first whole-brain tractography database, a study of stereotypy in position, number and connectivity of tracts and identified cell types, and a complete map of microconnectivity in the calyx of the mushroom body. In Aim 1, two recently generated whole-brain segmentations of all neurites and all synaptic clefts will be skeletonized, imported into CATMAID, and provided for use by the fly neurobiologists (>20 labs immediately; the entire community shortly thereafter). In Aim 2, tools for shape-based neuron search will be integrated into CATMAID, allowing online databases of cell type morphology to assist the reconstruction workflow and find genetic driver lines for behavior and physiology experiments at the bench. Analysis software will be written for automated tractography, location of contralateral circuit element equivalents, and identification of synaptic partners. In Aim 3, this infrastructure will be used in proof-of-principle analyses designed to test and guide infrastructure development, while providing important biological contributions in their own right. The proposed research is innovative because it will: almost immediately provide segmentation-assisted circuit reconstruction to the fly community in the whole fly brain dataset; provide powerful new analysis tools; and enable individual labs to form and manage their own public or private collaborations in an expertly managed server environment. The proposed research is significant because acceleration of circuit mapping will greatly increase our understanding of information processing in the brain of an important animal model system, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster; further, these tools will be applicable to diverse brain tissues and organisms. Ultimately, this infrastructure will therefore contribute to a qualitatively improved understanding of how neuronal circuits process and store information across phyla. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides a new and cutting-edge strategy to accelerate mapping of brain circuits at a synaptic level, a prerequisite to understanding circuit function in normal and diseased brains. The proposed infrastructure is relevant to the part of the BRAIN Initiative's mission that pertains to revolutionizing our understanding of brain function through tool development and improved data analysis technologies.","Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit",9822552,RF1MH120679,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automated Annotation', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mushroom Bodies', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'improved', 'information processing', 'infrastructure development', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light microscopy', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'stereotypy', 'tool', 'tool development', 'tractography']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,RF1,2019,1910784,0.006929652742315428
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling Project Summary/Abstract  This project develops machine learning approaches that describe statistical systems in biology. By combining analytic results calculated from the exact probabilistic description of the system with machine learning inference, our new methods present exciting opportunities to model previously inaccessible complex dynamics. The resulting Boltzmann machine-like learning algorithms present a new class of modeling techniques based on the powerful in- ference of arti cial neural networks. Further development of this approach will bring the groundbreaking advances from the surge of recent interest in machine learning into the biological modeling eld. The mathematical methods we develop will be used to derive e cient algorithms for multiscale simulation, directly applicable to large scale biological modeling. In particular, the algorithms will be used to study the dynamics of stochastic biochemistry at synapses, with direct relevance to learning and memory formation in the brain. Current studies of these processes are limited by the long timescales involved and the highly spatially organized structures featured. In addition to leveraging the machine learning expertise we are developing, we also employ new electron microscopy datasets to produce 3D reconstructions of neural tissue with unprecedented accuracy. Consequentially, we will be able to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, as well as the biochemical basis of oscillatory behavior in networks of neurons that occurs during sleep. Furthermore, the interactions of these highly stochastic ion channels with electrical in neurons will be explored through groundbreaking hybrid simulation environments. The software that we will develop combines existing popular simulation tools into multiscale approaches, and will be distributed as a powerful tool to the broader biological modeling community. Its usage in further computational experiments can present a key advancement in the development of pharmaceuticals, allowing the direct study of the interactions of biochemistry and whole neuron electrophysiology without making limiting assumptions to sim- plify the simulations. This has promising implications for intervening in age-related learning de cits, as well as in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Finally, this proposal will bring together our existing multiscale modeling community, the National Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS), with the MSM consortium. The interactions of these organizations and their communities of expert researchers will foster new collaborative work on exciting multiscale problems in biology, including applications of the machine learning frameworks and software we are developing. 1 Project Narrative  A wide variety of biological systems can be described statistically, from molecular biochemistry up to the network level activity of neurons. This work develops machine learning approaches to approximate these systems, enabling new simulation methods that bridge di erent levels of description. The resulting computational studies aim to shed light on the basis of learning and computation in the brain, and will enable the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. 1",Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling,9791802,R56AG059602,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consequentialism', 'Coupling', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'computer studies', 'experimental study', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'men who have sex with men', 'microscopic imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nervous system disorder', 'particle', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R56,2018,619053,0.019785788099831995
"MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings. NARRATIVE  Discovery of the Rosetta stone was an archaeological breakthrough, enabling translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics from parallel texts in ancient Greek. Understanding how the activity of different neuronal subtypes contributes to information processing in the brain is in desperate need of a similar cipher. Detailed studies in the cerebral cortex have revealed principles of how small groups of neurons work together, but these small-scale interactions have been difficult to relate to computations performed by larger groups of neurons, typically recorded without knowledge of cell identity, during animal perception and behavior. We will use advances in molecular-cell identification techniques and machine learning to create an automated classifier to decipher cell identity from dense electrophysiological recordings and decode brain function from neural activity.",MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION,9568053,R21NS104821,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Archaeology', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Clear Cell', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissent', 'Distant', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'In Vitro', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Somatostatin', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'cognitive process', 'excitatory neuron', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'somatosensory', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,197625,0.023630280098919043
"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics. Further, these experiments align with NIMH's mission to characterize the neural circuits of complex behaviors and mental illnesses.",Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles,9541373,F30MH115693,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Head', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'anxiety states', 'anxiety-related behavior', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'calcium indicator', 'conditioned fear', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'grasp', 'imaging approach', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F30,2018,35678,0.026928627721936514
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9628299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,120000,0.006936038869562405
"A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions in American children and adults. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits. The immediate goals of this innovative proposal are to decipher the neural code predicting compulsive overconsumption of sugar and to develop new approaches, algorithms, and technologies to detect neural signals of craving in real-time to avert maladaptive behaviors with unprecedented precision. Specifically, the project outline will begin by identifying neural circuits mediating compulsive sucrose seeking. Next, we will record neural activity using in vivo electrophysiology and fluorescence microendoscopy of GCaMP5-expressing cells to collect precise, first-order, raw features with high signal-to-noise ratio during cue-induced reinstatement and compulsion behavioral assays with their time-locked neural correlates allows for the identification of craving states. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine classification of neural activity allows for a Bayesian hidden Markov model for a transition diagram between states in craving-compulsion-consumption behavioral chains. Following identification of neural activity signaling “craving” states (operationally defined as the behavioral state immediately preceding compulsive reward-seeking), real-time state detection will be used to trigger precise optogenetic inhibition of compulsive sucrose-seeking. A successful outcome of this research would establish a new paradigm for the treatment for obesity, focusing on reprogramming the neural circuit perturbations that cause obesity, as opposed to treating the physical consequences of a neural circuit imbalance – an approach that could also be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This proposal is ideally suited for the New Innovator Award for the following reasons: First, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundation for translating Neural Circuit Reprogramming to human patients. Second, the proposal is focused on technology development, delivering new technologies that will enable not state-identification and dynamic triggering used for Neural Circuit Reprogramming, and serve as springboards for other fields. Third, this proposal heavily leverages my unique background in sucrose-self administration, relapse, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging, but is technically and conceptually distinct from my lab’s other studies on acute perturbations that affect anxiety, depression and addiction. As a new faculty member at MIT, I am poised at the nexus of science, engineering, computation and technology and am equipped with the precise skill set and expertise to execute this high-risk, yet potentially revolutionary project. Obesity afflicts ~35% of Americans, representing one of the greatest threats to the health of our nation, for both children and adults. With obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and other associated health problems skyrocketing, it is imperative that we focus on addressing the source of the problem rather than just treating the symptoms.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,9692129,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,271149,0.024294446971007546
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9509569,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,375839,0.05143605220589121
"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning,9692133,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Update', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fictional works', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'source guides']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,429555,0.025875378742430347
"Toward Automated Spike Sorting via Ground Truth Neural Recordings PROJECT​ ​SUMMARY Scaling extracellular electrophysiology to higher channel counts is hindered by the burden of data handling,storage, and especially preprocessing, e.g. spike sorting ​[1]​. The burden of spike sorting can in principle be reduced through a combination of high-density multielectrode array (probe) technology and algorithm optimization to yield a spike sorting method that is both highly accurate and fully automated [2–4]​. With a known-good spike sorting method in hand, the algorithm can be baked into the data stream as early as possible to allow for automatic data sorting and a massive reduction in data rate to downstream storage and processing. However, it takes an investment of considerable resources to implement this sort of large-scale real-time processing, and great confidence to throw away raw data and keep​ ​only​ ​processed​ ​data. Accuracy and automation of spike sorting increases with the spatial density of recording sites ​[5–7]​. Neural activity recorded from high-density probes can serve as a data corpus for testing the accuracy of spike sorting algorithms. However, to quantify spike sorting performance for comparison between algorithms, the ground truth spiking activity of neurons captured in the data corpus must be measured, such as by simultaneously recording via patch-clamp pipette or some other recording modality ​[8–10]​. Unfortunately, because ground truth recordings are so challenging to perform, they remain too rare to allow for this sort of analysis in a large-scale, meaningful way ​[11]​. Until this need is met, spike sorting development lacks a compass, and cutting-edge techniques such as supervised machine learning which require large amounts of labelled data remain out-of-reach ​[12]​. ​Accordingly, we propose a series of multimodal neural recordings combining multielectrode array and patch pipette techniques to generate​ ​a​ ​corpus​ ​of​ ​ground​ ​truth​ ​data​ ​for​ ​validation​ ​of​ ​spike​ ​sorting​ ​algorithms.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9594042,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,661507,0.05359323301273768
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9483798,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,350000,0.03564256634830056
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9632111,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2018,99879,0.019876312585955253
"From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the gap Recent advances in experimental technology promise rapid progress in developing a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuit structure, at the synaptic scale, leads to complex sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors. Volume EM techniques have advanced to the point that neural tissue can be imaged at synaptic resolution in volumes large enough (~ 100 µm) to contain a entire small neuron . Innovations in machine learning approaches to analyzing these EM images have now permitted automated segmentation of these into 3D representations of every neuronal process within the volume. However, significant technical challenges remain to improve EM acquisition and analysis methods to the point of achieving the millimeter-scale volumes required to reconstruct neuronal assemblies underlying complex behaviors. Tools are needed to improve the reliability of EM systems for the acquisition of such large datasets. Automated methods to identify the cell-type of segmented neurites and to characterize the firing patterns of neurons prior to EM imaging are also needed, as are software tools to query and visualize the resulting rich 3D datasets—essentially allowing neuroscientists to carry out ‘virtual experiments.’ Here we propose to develop a set of tools to address each of these problems. These tools will be developed in the context of the songbird, a powerful model organism to study the neural circuits underlying the production and learning of a complex vocal/motor behavior. Neural recordings in singing birds of every known cell type in cortical, thalamic, and basal ganglia circuits, have led to mechanistic circuit-level hypotheses, which in turn make clear and testable predictions about the ultrastructure of neural circuits. The proposed tools would allow neuroscientists to bridge the gap from vEM data to the virtuous circle of hypothesis driven anatomical experimentation, and data-inspired hypotheses. Our proposal describes three Specific Aims directed toward these goals: · Aim 1: Develop tools to acq uire and to automatically segment millimeter-scale EM data sets · Aim 2: Develop tools to densely identify cell-types of segmented neurites using ultrastructural fingerprints · Aim 3: Develop and test a platform for virtual experimentation in segmented and annotated EM datasets PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this BRAIN Initiative project is to develop tools and resources that will facilitate the detailed analysis of brain microconnectivity. We will develop new approaches and optimize existing techniques to facilitate this important new approach to understanding the basic circuitry and computations underlying brain function. The connectomic tools we develop will be of interest to, and will be made accessible to, the broader scientific community; such tools, and the detailed annotated structural datasets they enable, will facilitate the study of neurobiological mechanisms of brain disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and Huntington’s disease.",From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap,9609873,RF1MH117809,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biophysics', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Distant', 'Dorsal', 'Dreams', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Equipment', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'LOC118430 gene', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Songbirds', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2018,70863,0.05801047644514622
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9524750,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,205290,0.022020879889683376
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9536330,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,407497,0.05721955229456822
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9487337,R01MH109180,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,236692,0.053541266491042794
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9526901,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2018,281216,0.010903121085598275
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9584824,U19NS107466,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2018,2979311,0.03506685910112831
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9471853,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2018,536521,0.018032507706743577
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9488537,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,446302,0.013409141993259432
"High-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy system The Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) proposes to build a high-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy (TEM) system. Two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in behaving animals is important for many projects at Princeton, including several that are part of the U.S. BRAIN Initiative. The technique is being applied to large neural populations distributed across the entire nervous systems of small animals (worm, ?y, or larval zebra?sh), as well as to particular regions of the mouse brain (neocortex, medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia). These large-scale observations of neural activity are conducted while the animal is performing complex behaviors such as navigation, decisionmaking, and courtship. The TEM system would add large-scale anatomical information with unprecedented resolution and completeness. The extremely high throughput of the system would make it routine to perform serial section TEM imaging of the entire brain for small animals, or of large brain regions for the mouse. It would be possible to directly relate anatomy and physiology by applying two-photon calcium imaging and TEM to exactly the same neurons. In the past, this combined approach has been hindered by the fact that 3D EM imaging generates a huge amount of data and has taken months or years for even a small volume. The system will be fast enough to produce a petabyte in a few months, enough for a millimeter-scale brain volume. PNI is one of the few places in the world that is ready to handle petascale datasets, as PNI has recently received funding from IARPA to scale up EM image analysis techniques, including deep learning and crowdsourcing. The instrument will be housed in the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics, in the basement of the new PNI building. The Bezos Center already provides two-photon microscopy technologies to laboratories at PNI, and would become an even more important resource with the TEM system. Combined with existing capabilities in two-photon calcium imaging, the MultiSEM will enable the Princeton Neuroscience Institute to relate the structure and function of neural circuits. This should improve our understanding of normal brain function, and aid in understanding brain diseases that are caused by miswired or degenerated neural circuits.",High-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy system,9494063,S10OD023602,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Courtship', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electron Microscope', 'Funding', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Medial', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Zebrafish', 'brain volume', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'instrument', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'petabyte', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'two-photon']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,S10,2018,2000000,0.017502759451783145
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This project will develop an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms of timed motor behavior by combining large-scale neural recordings from multiple brain areas and computational modeling of neural networks. n/a",CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses,9518011,R01NS100050,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'computer framework', 'conditioning', 'driving force', 'dynamic system', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pressure', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,297172,0.06107273146247026
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9513320,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2018,51923,0.0022289470604837025
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9449472,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,378758,0.036152377797230933
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior.

"Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome Project Summary We propose to build a next generation crowdsourcing platform (code named “FlyWire”) for mapping the fly connectome using transmission electron microscopy images that were acquired at Janelia Research Campus. FlyWire will depart from EyeWire, a previous crowdsourcing platform, in two major ways: (1) Much higher throughput will be attained by leveraging the latest in deep learning. (2) FlyWirers will consist mainly of fly neuroscientists, while EyeWirers were primarily nonscientists. Once minimum usability and functionality are achieved with the Murthy lab as the pilot users, FlyWire will be opened up to the entire Drosophila neurobiology community. All reconstructions will be shared by the community. To motivate productivity and accuracy, the reconstruction of a neuron and its outgoing synapses will be reported through a “micropublication,” with a quantitative formula for assigning authorship. To guide the development of FlyWire, the Murthy lab will reconstruct all presynaptic and postsynaptic partners of a subset of central brain neurons involved in sensory processing and behavior. We will use the connectome of these neurons as a launching point to investigate how feature­selective sensory responses arise and how they are decoded to change behavior. We will also create software tools for matching FlyWire neurons with light microscopic reconstructions of neurons. The proposed project will complement Janelia’s efforts to obtain the fly connectome with FIB­SEM imaging. Janelia’s final FIB­SEM connectome is estimated to take up to five years, though draft connectomes should become available sooner. FlyWire will provide Drosophila neuroscientists with badly needed information about connectivity in the years before the FIB­SEM connectome becomes available. Multiple connectomes will enable the study of variability across individuals and between sexes (FlyWire will reconstruct a female brain, while the first FIB­ SEM connectome will be of a male brain.)

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9572441,R01NS104892,"['Accelerometer', 'Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,386750,0.09045202335419915
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9615336,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,21194,0.0479452371852156
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9534670,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,423985,0.000774559197071818
"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice. We will test this system on multiple mouse models of auditory spectrum disorders to uncover novel covariation in the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological phenotypes.",High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice,9601457,R21MH116450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'House mice', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Linux', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Raspberries', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensory', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wild Animals', 'Work', 'animal model development', 'auditory processing', 'base', 'behavior test', 'flexibility', 'gene discovery', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2018,209328,0.00997978745846791
"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination.

"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9518000,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2018,570779,0.029366470372220472
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory.

"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9546689,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,332220,0.0401507318825955
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9538277,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,477795,0.032266450348767226
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9692121,R01DA047869,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,254642,0.06801874928456599

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input.

"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders.

"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord.

Recent advances in molecular, electrophysiological and imaging techniques have led to a rapid enhancement in our understanding of the mechanisms that shape dendritic structure, function and connectivity and the contribution of dendritic computation to behavior. Computational and theoretical approaches have further refined our views of dendrites and their unique role in brain function. Notably, dendrite structure and function may undergo plastic changes that contribute to nervous system development and learning, and dysfunction in these mechanisms can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together researchers whose latest findings help clarify how the properties of dendrites enable them to perform complex computations important for sensory-motor processing and higher cognitive function.The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites. Project Narrative Neuronal dendrites receive and integrate inputs from other neurons to regulate the information flow through neural circuits. This Gordon Research Conference and Seminar will convene scientists of all levels and from diverse fields of neuroscience to present and discuss cutting-edge research on dendrite structure and function in health and disease. This conference will strengthen communication between scientists working on dendrites and enhance the already rapid pace of discovery in this field.","2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar",9682708,R13NS110205,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biochemical', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Creativeness', 'Dendrites', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gated Ion Channel', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Income', 'Information Storage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retreatment', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'interest', 'meetings', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'planetary Atmosphere', 'racial minority', 'symposium', 'translational scientist', 'unpublished works', 'voltage']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,20000,0.023012396784184312
"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex. These studies will facilitate our understanding of the function of cortical neural circuits and yield insight into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. 1",Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex,9531438,R01MH109665,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth Order', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Medial', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Training', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'molecular marker', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'online resource', 'operation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,797983,0.0023015662552325735
"MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings. NARRATIVE  Discovery of the Rosetta stone was an archaeological breakthrough, enabling translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics from parallel texts in ancient Greek. Understanding how the activity of different neuronal subtypes contributes to information processing in the brain is in desperate need of a similar cipher. Detailed studies in the cerebral cortex have revealed principles of how small groups of neurons work together, but these small-scale interactions have been difficult to relate to computations performed by larger groups of neurons, typically recorded without knowledge of cell identity, during animal perception and behavior. We will use advances in molecular-cell identification techniques and machine learning to create an automated classifier to decipher cell identity from dense electrophysiological recordings and decode brain function from neural activity.",MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION,9449797,R21NS104821,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Archaeology', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Clear Cell', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissent', 'Distant', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'In Vitro', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Somatostatin', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'cognitive process', 'excitatory neuron', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'somatosensory', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,237150,0.023630280098919043
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects.

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch. The proposed studies will determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex in which single neurons process and transmit information about itch and pain.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species.

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9351131,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2017,2910000,0.019876312585955253
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9315937,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,205290,0.022020879889683376
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9301514,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2017,293470,0.010903121085598275
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9275028,R01MH109180,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,241790,0.053541266491042794
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need.

"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9279262,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,446302,0.013409141993259432
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,9247804,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Injectable', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,418329,0.06922668267645544
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9395464,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2017,59166,0.0022289470604837025
"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue. Project Narrative This project will develop new optical imaging techniques for real-time neural activity tracking across large volumes of scattering brain tissue.

"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This project will develop an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms of timed motor behavior by combining large-scale neural recordings from multiple brain areas and computational modeling of neural networks. n/a",CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses,9306222,R01NS100050,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'computer framework', 'conditioning', 'driving force', 'dynamic system', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,297289,0.06107273146247026
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9238503,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,378758,0.036152377797230933
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement) Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments.

"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9450709,R01NS104892,"['Accelerometer', 'Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Recurrence', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,386750,0.09045202335419915
"Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles underlying cerebellar circuits. We will use large-scale electron microscopy to extract cerebellar network anatomy.

"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise.

"Neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern perception Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult, yet vital capabilities that the auditory system must achieve. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure can have profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, as well as improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. While much has been learned about the loci of language-related processing using non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans, these techniques cannot answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. As a result, the explicit cellular circuit-level and neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing are poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language, in particular the processing of temporal patterns within communication signals. The experiments outlined in this proposal investigate the neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent speech sounds (phonemes) can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Sensitivity to transition statistics is not exclusive to speech signals however, but reflects general auditory processes shared by many animals. In Aim 1 we investigate the categorical perception of complex auditory objects in populations of cortical neurons in an animal model, and ask how these neural representations are effected by temporal context. In addition to which elements occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Studies in Aim 2 focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. In Aim 3, we propose a basic circuit in which population level representations of auditory objects could be differentially modulated by patterning rules, and test this proposed pattern processing circuit using direct, casual manipulations. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern perception,9527903,R56DC016408,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transition Elements', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language processing', 'microstimulation', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2017,363607,-0.04263139195264773
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9310382,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,323033,-0.009329132633560814
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9402502,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2017,581182,0.029366470372220472
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9327009,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Neural Pathways', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2017,242522,0.012352751071918482
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9444124,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2017,3087282,0.04184449233729107
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9360116,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,332220,0.0401507318825955
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9324362,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plasticizers', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,479269,0.032266450348767226

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9470632,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2017,33050,-0.006110867858861553
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9284528,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,341250,0.0520884649574866
"A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions in American children and adults. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits. The immediate goals of this innovative proposal are to decipher the neural code predicting compulsive overconsumption of sugar and to develop new approaches, algorithms, and technologies to detect neural signals of craving in real-time to avert maladaptive behaviors with unprecedented precision. Specifically, the project outline will begin by identifying neural circuits mediating compulsive sucrose seeking. Next, we will record neural activity using in vivo electrophysiology and fluorescence microendoscopy of GCaMP5-expressing cells to collect precise, first-order, raw features with high signal-to-noise ratio during cue-induced reinstatement and compulsion behavioral assays with their time-locked neural correlates allows for the identification of craving states. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine classification of neural activity allows for a Bayesian hidden Markov model for a transition diagram between states in craving-compulsion-consumption behavioral chains. Following identification of neural activity signaling ""craving"" states (operationally defind as the behavioral state immediately preceding compulsive reward-seeking), real-time state detection will be used to trigger precise optogenetic inhibition of compulsive sucrose-seeking. A successful outcome of this research would establish a new paradigm for the treatment for obesity, focusing on reprogramming the neural circuit perturbations that cause obesity, as opposed to treating the physical consequences of a neural circuit imbalance - an approach that could also be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  This proposal is ideally suited for the New Innovator Award for the following reasons: First, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundation for translating Neural Circuit Reprogramming to human patients. Second, the proposal is focused on technology development, delivering new technologies that will enable not state-identification and dynamic triggering used for Neural Circuit Reprogramming, and serve as springboards for other fields. Third, this proposal heavily leverages my unique background in sucrose-self administration, relapse, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging, but is technically and conceptually distinct from my lab's other studies on acute perturbations that affect anxiety, depression and addiction. As a new faculty member at MIT, I am poised at the nexus of science, engineering, computation and technology and am equipped with the precise skill set and expertise to execute this high-risk, yet potentially revolutionary project. n/a",A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits,9284928,DP2DK102256,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Self Administration', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sucrose', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'addiction', 'combat', 'compulsion', 'craving', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sugar', 'technology development']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,DP2,2016,2560,0.05735439238842239
"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch. The proposed studies will determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex in which single neurons process and transmit information about itch and pain. Project Narrative/Relevance Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9136881,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,352019,0.05143605220589121
"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,9089992,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'taste stimuli', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2016,167410,0.0344773744851251
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states Abstract  In the last decade it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression play an important role in brain function and dysfunction. Disruption in neuroepigenetic developmental processes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation result in mental retardation and cognitive impairments. More recently, neuroepigenetic processes have also been implicated in adult behaviors, such as addiction and memory. This opens the possibility that these mechanisms may be able to control the establishment and maintenance of behavioral states. However, the underlying mechanisms through which neuroepigenetic processes can mediate changes in circuit excitability to determine behavioral states remain mysterious. Moreover, because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, and the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific circuits. This presents a major roadblock towards unlocking the interface between brain and environment and their role in human health and disease. Here we propose a three-prong solution to this problem by using: a brain that shows conserved neurochemistry and neuroepigenetic mechanisms, but with orders of magnitude fewer neurons and homogenous circuits compared to mammalian brains, behaviors that are regulated by the environment (hunger and satiety), and an environment that is experimentally controllable (fasting vs. re-feeding; normal diet vs. high sugar diet). Changes in the excitability and plasticity of conserved circuits determine outputs feeding states like hunger and satiety. These changes occur slow, are persistent over hours, depend on the physiological state and are bidirectional. Thus, they could be encoded neuroepigenetically to alter the expression of key genes important to modulate circuit excitability. Furthermore, because a large number of metabolism intermediates functions as cofactors for chromatin modifying enzymes, physiological changes in metabolites and nutrients can directly alter gene expression. My lab has pioneered techniques and established unique collaborations to address the functional role of neuroepigenetic processes in regulating the activity of specific circuits in the context of feeding states. We propose to map how environmental inputs act on chromatin and gene expression to direct the changes in neuronal excitability that underlie output feeding behaviors. First, we will identify the specific chromatin pathways that act in a unique circuit important to switch the behavioral state of the fly between hungry and sated. We will then map the functional genetic loci of integration between physiological state and output behavioral states by examining the occupancy of these pathways on chromatin and their effect on behavior and neural activity. We will then dissect how changes in environmental input (energy scarcity in fasting, energy availability in re-feeding, and energy surplus in a high sugar diet) directly affect gene expression by altering the activity of these pathways and their genetic loci of integration. To this end, we will work with analytical chemists to develop new methods to measure changes in metabolites in the blood, brain and specific circuits and with computational biologists to harness machine learning analysis to integrate metabolism and gene expression datasets to identify the molecular pathways that act at the interface between input and effector mechanisms to regulate output behavioral states. Because the endocrine and physiological changes that underlie hunger and satiety are evolutionary conserved, our approach will provide a model of how the environment can functionally determine bidirectional, flip-flop behavioral states through neuroepigenetic mechanisms. More broadly, these studies will uncover how epigenetic mechanisms may function as gatekeepers of “behavioral states” (normal and abnormal), to provide the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the “conditioning” effect of environments (from nutrients to maternal care) on neural plasticity.

"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9090040,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2016,293470,0.010903121085598275
"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function.

"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9130265,R01MH109180,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,246990,0.053541266491042794
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9120413,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information gathering', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,446302,0.013409141993259432

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction.

"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,9109046,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive task', 'combinatorial', 'connectome', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'mental function', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,313000,0.0690544593160735
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9170501,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2016,450322,0.000774559197071818
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.

"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9005185,R01DC014950,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,327250,0.04323130682927429
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies.

This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics. This achievement will be a crucial step towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of cognition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities and s disrupted in diseases such as schizophrenia. The long-term goals of this project are to characterize neural activity dynamics related to working memory in diverse brain regions, and to account for those dynamics in an integrated, brain-wide fashion in terms of cellular and circuit mechanisms. These goals will be achieved by observing, mapping, and perturbing brain circuits using advanced technologies which will be disseminated to the entire neuroscience community to accelerate progress towards understanding brain function and dysfunction.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory,9126618,U01NS090541,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Ramp', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory Process', 'Short-Term Memory', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social computing', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,75000,0.03496852948064601
"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. To make focused progress, we will undertake a comprehensive integration of experiments and computational models of the structure and function of whole-brain circuits in transparent fish experiencing virtual reality.","Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity",9119539,U01NS090449,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Fishes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Receptors', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,956033,0.05843088891535623
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9097814,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Internships', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,323032,-0.009329132633560814
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,9098854,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2016,248999,0.0005830110086826514
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9111024,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2016,186761,0.012352751071918482
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9170395,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,349970,0.0401507318825955
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9113674,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,476856,0.032266450348767226
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders.

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch. The proposed studies will determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex in which single neurons process and transmit information about itch and pain.                 Project Narrative/Relevance Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.                ",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9030044,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'light microscopy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,340627,0.05143605220589121
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative. The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.",High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits,8856373,R01NS076467,"['2 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Fast Electron', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nanometer', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'young adult']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,1543491,0.06198926501991923
"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,8890825,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'taste stimuli', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2015,166288,0.0344773744851251

"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9052858,R01MH109180,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,213460,0.053541266491042794
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms.

"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.                ","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",8957240,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information gathering', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,502152,0.013409141993259432
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8856665,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Health', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,418491,0.06922668267645544
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory.

"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level.

The current project develops novel imaging tools and analysis concepts to simultaneously study large groups of nerve cells in the awake brain with high temporal and cellular resolution, and will lay the groundwork for deeper insights into how the brain processes information and may provide mechanistic insights into brain disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.",Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics,8935976,U01NS090569,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'auditory discrimination', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cell type', 'density', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'millisecond', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",U01,2015,250000,0.09824375783200995
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8899642,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive task', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'mental function', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,313000,0.0690544593160735
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8807937,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,341436,0.010611934148729628
"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide. Progress has been limited by the availability of tools to investigate neuronal circuits with temporal and special specificity until the development of optogenetics. Because current optogenetic tools are still limited in purpose our goal is to maximize the optogenetic toolkit by providing much-needed tools for the broad neuroscience community.",Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination,8806609,R21MH103824,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chimera organism', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homologous Protein', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infrared Rays', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Left', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Parents', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Potassium', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vent', 'Visible Radiation', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'desensitization', 'design', 'directed evolution', 'improved', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'microbial', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2015,208125,0.04636102345690967
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8898252,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2015,249000,0.0005830110086826514
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8920676,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,323033,-0.009329132633560814
"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8849468,K99HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2015,82417,0.012352751071918482

Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9085979,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2015,249000,0.012352751071918482
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.            ",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,8964760,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plastics', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473336,0.032266450348767226
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary. Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.",Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices,8850914,R01NS076462,"['Action Potentials', 'Adhesives', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bathing', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caliber', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Chemicals', 'Child Development', 'Contralateral', 'Contrast Media', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Electroplating', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'density', 'design', 'electrical potential', 'improved', 'information processing', 'magnetic field', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural stimulation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'research study', 'sensor', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'voltage']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,392217,0.02674611050089152
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8928250,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,341250,0.0520884649574866
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.                ",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,8766158,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2014,167410,0.0344773744851251
"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function. Our procedures and analysis will mitigate many of the difficulties that have limited our ability to discern the structre and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.                ",Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits,8827174,U01NS090595,"['Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Comparative Anatomy', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Embryonic Development', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Group Meetings', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Jaw', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neck', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nociception', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smell Perception', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Taste Perception', 'Technology', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tongue', 'Touch sensation', 'Trigeminal System', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'feeding', 'image processing', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'nerve stem cell', 'orofacial', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'vocalization']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2014,851597,0.08380663942933883
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8710346,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,418570,0.06922668267645544
"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. To make focused progress, we will undertake a comprehensive integration of experiments and computational models of the structure and function of whole-brain circuits in transparent fish experiencing virtual reality.                ","Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity",8826324,U01NS090449,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Fishes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Plastics', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Receptors', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,1069693,0.05843088891535623
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics. This achievement will be a crucial step towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of cognition.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities and s disrupted in diseases such as schizophrenia. The long-term goals of this project are to characterize neural activity dynamics related to working memory in diverse brain regions, and to account for those dynamics in an integrated, brain-wide fashion in terms of cellular and circuit mechanisms. These goals will be achieved by observing, mapping, and perturbing brain circuits using advanced technologies which will be disseminated to the entire neuroscience community to accelerate progress towards understanding brain function and dysfunction.                ",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory,8827069,U01NS090541,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Ramp', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory Process', 'Short-Term Memory', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,250000,0.03496852948064601
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.   The current project develops novel imaging tools and analysis concepts to simultaneously study large groups of nerve cells in the awake brain with high temporal and cellular resolution, and will lay the groundwork for deeper insights into how the brain processes information and may provide mechanistic insights into brain disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.                ",Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics,8827121,U01NS090569,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'auditory discrimination', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'density', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'millisecond', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",U01,2014,250000,0.09824375783200995
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.

"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8624688,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,344886,0.010611934148729628
"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide. Progress has been limited by the availability of tools to investigate neuronal circuits with temporal and special specificity until the development of optogenetics.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8892350,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2014,249000,0.0005830110086826514
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.                ",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8634272,K99HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Neural Pathways', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2014,82417,0.012352751071918482
"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8722888,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2014,8990,0.043823783309497946
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.                ",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8761846,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,339427,0.0520884649574866
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subcellular distribution of synapses is critical for the assembly, function, and plasticity of the nervous system and plays a role in its disorders. Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. While advanced multidimensional images, in conjunction with single-cell genetic techniques, have afforded an unprecedented opportunity to understand synapse development at a new level, there is a knowledge gap in our capacity to effectively quantify subcellular synapses from large quantities of three-dimensional images. This is a significant problem and has hampered large-scale studies of the molecular mechanisms of synapse development, especially in neurons with complex arbor-such as Purkinje cells in mammals and lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC) in Drosophila-where existing approaches do not yield complete or robust synapse quantification for the entire dendritic tree and do not scale to efficient genetic screening. The objective of thi project is to bridge this gap by providing tools for quantitative investigation of subcellular synapse distribution and its molecular mechanisms using three-dimensional microscopy images. Specifically, our highly cross- disciplinary team will pursue two aims: (1) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Holistic and objective description of synapse density will enable automatic detection of mutant patterns. (2) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in different parts of the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Efficient quantification at distinct subcellular locations will assist discovery of novel regulators for different subcellular parts. As a test case, we will use synapse distribution n Drosophila LPTC neurons, which are amenable to both genome-wide genetic screens and genetic manipulations with single-neuron resolution. We will develop reliable methods to characterize the density of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory cholinergic synapses from three-dimensional fluorescence confocal images. Our algorithms will lead to the next level of mechanistic understanding that controls the subcellular distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and enable a wide range of quantitative analyses for other types of neurons with similar complexity. Powerful multichannel co-analysis and machine learning approaches will be used to improve synapse detection and subcellular compartment extraction for overcoming challenges in 3D confocal image, including staining artifacts and anisotropic resolution. Algorithms will be developed using a model-guided methodology that emphasizes efficiency for large volume 3D images during genetic screening. Pattern-recognition methods will be used to speed up proofreading of the synapse quantification results. A novel ordering strategy will be adapted for neurons of complex dendritic arbor to quantify subcellular synapses in a functionally meaningful way. The project will produce a set of open-source, extensible tools for automatic synapse quantification and proofreading, with friendly graphical-user interfaces, to serve the neuroscience community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the subcellular distribution of synapses remain largely unknown, which hinders the discovery of novel therapies for many neurological disorders. By developing new, efficient automatic algorithms and open-source tools for quantifying synapses in neurons, this research intends to advance the capacity to effectively analyze large quantities of three-dimensional neuronal images, especially those of complex dendritic arbor. The work will impact public health by enabling a better understanding of disease mechanisms, which is the critical first step toward new treatments, and supports NIH's goal to advance understanding of fundamental biology to uncover the causes of specific diseases.            ",Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor,8574710,R15MH099569,"['Academic Research Enhancement Awards', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic synapse', 'density', 'falls', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2013,461165,0.00936536374693883
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.            ",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8558913,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,413444,0.06922668267645544
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.                ",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8639755,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,313000,0.0690544593160735
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8505855,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,365000,0.010611934148729628
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8424238,K99NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2013,90662,0.0005830110086826514
"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease. We propose to develop a universal way to discover how genes work together in circuits, eventually leading to better diagnosis and therapy.             n/a",Center for Cell Circuits,8463229,P50HG006193,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Explosion', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome Components', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'embryonic stem cell', 'frontier', 'gene discovery', 'genetic profiling', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",P50,2013,2921325,0.016629760147353494
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.                ","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8527041,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2013,52190,0.043823783309497946
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding. The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes  sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders  of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering,  mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and  neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea  could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.",Coding of auditory space in the avian brain,8521234,R01DC007690,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Physiology', 'Auditory system', 'Barn Owls', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Ear', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Saccades', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Strigiformes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory nuclei', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'theories']",NIDCD,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,324389,0.041458567732679995
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors.

"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.                This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease.

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.           The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.  This system will help understand how brain cells process information.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease.

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.              Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.

"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.              Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.

These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7392804,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,35821,0.02435287133009816
"Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks to become independent as a neuroscientist and to work at the interface between neuroscience and physics. The Sloan-Swartz Center at UCSF provides a unique opportunity to become immersed in neuroscience at its cutting edge. While the majority of her time will be spent in research, she will attend a range of systems neuroscience and computer vision courses. The immediate goals of her research are to develop an information-theoretic method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non- Gaussian and have strong spatiotemporal correlations; and to use this method to analyze the responses of visual cortical neurons to natural time-varying images. There are numerous indications that the responses of neurons to natural stimuli cannot be completely predicted from their responses to stimuli with simple statistical properties, such as white noise ensembles. However, existing methods for analyzing single neuron responses may be rigorously applied only to Gaussian ensembles. The information-theoretic method involves finding the stimulus dimensions that carry the most information about the neuron's response. The stimulus ensemble is not assumed to be Gaussian. The only assumption made is that the neuron is selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high-dimensional stimulus space: responses with respect to the relevant dimensions might be arbitrarily nonlinear. After testing the method on model neurons and verifying that it gives reasonable results for cortical neurons probed by natural scenes, the method will be used to test the categorical distinction between simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex. The method will then be modified so that a large set of directions related to each other via certain symmetry operations, such as translation or scaling, can be simultaneously found, with the goal of systematically probing neurons in extrastriate areas with natural scenes. n/a",Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli,7418710,K25MH068904,"['Accidents', 'Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Area', 'Area Analyses', 'Auditory', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Formulations', 'Ear', 'Felis catus', 'Fire - disasters', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Physics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rotation', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'indium arsenide', 'interest', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'size', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector', 'voltage']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K25,2008,97809,-0.008442347480398914
"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed. Here we propose a collaborative research project between a mathematician (Kenneth Harris) and an electrophysiologist (Gyorgy Buzsaki), with the aim of recording, analyzing, and modeling the activity of large neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex and its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs. The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.      We will investigate the hypothesis that psychotomimetic effects of low doses of dissociative anesthetics are caused by a partial distortion in assembly organization, whereas larger doses cause a more complete distortion resulting anesthesia. If reliable signatures of psychotomimetic doses on assembly structure are found, this will suggest a novel method of drug screening for antipsychotics, whereby candidate drugs are evaluated by their ability to reverse these signatures. n/a",CRCNS: Info.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.  This system will help understand how brain cells process information.  This will help design assistive technology for people with severe paralysis.       n/a",A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex,7533930,R01NS062031,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cavia', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Computer information processing', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'awake', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'desire', 'disability', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'microsystems', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'tool']",NINDS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,527963,0.012115275510146788

"Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuing project is directed at describing dendrite structure in a compact yet sufficiently complete and detailed fashion to allow the computer generation of morphologically accurate neuronal models. Dendrite morphology plays a fundamental role in physiological and pathological brain function by subserving and shaping network connectivity and by integrating the complex pattern of synaptic inputs received by the neuron. A parsimonious and algorithmic description of dendritic shape is a crucial step towards the quantitative characterization of the structure-activity relationship in the nervous system and it constitutes an effective way to represent, compress, store, exchange, and amplify extremely complex neuroanatomical data. Neuroanatomical algorithms and models have been developed to simulate and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional structure of dendritic trees in the same format used to represent experimentally reconstructed neurons.      The specific aims of this project are: (1) to expand and improve neuroanatomically plausible algorithms of dendritic structure and development by including determinants of three-dimensional branch orientation and dependence of growth upon local and global influences (e.g. diameter and neuronal size, respectively); (2) to enhance and distribute the analysis, modeling, and data basing software in order to provide experimental and computational neuroscientists with web-based tools to query, retrieve, measure, classify, and synthesize dendritic morphology data; (3) to continue the experimental reconstruction and analysis of hippocampal pyramidal cells and spinal motoneurons with different experimental protocols and in early postnatal periods; and to integrate these data with detailed biophysical models of neuronal electrophysiology. The informatics and neuroscience components of this research are deeply intertwined and span a variety of scientific approaches, including ""wet"" experiments, computational simulations, statistical analysis and data mining.

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,7072822,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2006,197082,0.020505810219709
"CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control Current technology allows the simultaneous recording from hundreds of cells in the brains of awake behaving animals. Using this information to understand how the brain represents and processes complex information is a fundamental scientific challenge with large practical benefits to human health. In particular this project will develop technologies for neural prostheses which promise a new generation of therapies for the severely disabled to allow them to regain the ability to interact with the world. To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required. An interdisciplinary team including computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and neuroscientists will work in close concert to exploit existing infrastructure and experience with neural prostheses to address fundamental problems necessary for the practical application of these devices in humans.

"Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks to become independent as a neuroscientist and to work at the interface between neuroscience and physics. The Sloan-Swartz Center at UCSF provides a unique opportunity to become immersed in neuroscience at its cutting edge. While the majority of her time will be spent in research, she will attend a range of systems neuroscience and computer vision courses. The immediate goals of her research are to develop an information-theoretic method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non- Gaussian and have strong spatiotemporal correlations; and to use this method to analyze the responses of visual cortical neurons to natural time-varying images. There are numerous indications that the responses of neurons to natural stimuli cannot be completely predicted from their responses to stimuli with simple statistical properties, such as white noise ensembles. However, existing methods for analyzing single neuron responses may be rigorously applied only to Gaussian ensembles. The information-theoretic method involves finding the stimulus dimensions that carry the most information about the neuron's response. The stimulus ensemble is not assumed to be Gaussian. The only assumption made is that the neuron is selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high-dimensional stimulus space: responses with respect to the relevant dimensions might be arbitrarily nonlinear. After testing the method on model neurons and verifying that it gives reasonable results for cortical neurons probed by natural scenes, the method will be used to test the categorical distinction between simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex. The method will then be modified so that a large set of directions related to each other via certain symmetry operations, such as translation or scaling, can be simultaneously found, with the goal of systematically probing neurons in extrastriate areas with natural scenes. n/a",Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli,7035246,K25MH068904,"['biophysics', 'cats', 'information theory', 'mathematics', 'method development', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'neurophysiology', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'visual cortex', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,K25,2006,92195,-0.008442347480398914
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7125904,R01MH066990,"['bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neurophysiology', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'statistics /biometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2006,36891,0.02435287133009816
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6857150,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,358050,0.07375020464744701

After testing the method on model neurons and verifying that it gives reasonable results for cortical neurons probed by natural scenes, the method will be used to test the categorical distinction between simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex. The method will then be modified so that a large set of directions related to each other via certain symmetry operations, such as translation or scaling, can be simultaneously found, with the goal of systematically probing neurons in extrastriate areas with natural scenes. n/a",Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli,6881439,K25MH068904,"['biophysics', 'cats', 'information theory', 'mathematics', 'method development', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'neurophysiology', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'visual cortex', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,K25,2005,89509,-0.008442347480398914
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6708002,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,358050,0.07375020464744701
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy.

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6768857,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2004,201825,0.020505810219709
"CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control Current technology allows the simultaneous recording from hundreds of cells in the brains of awake behaving animals. Using this information to understand how the brain represents and processes complex information is a fundamental scientific challenge with large practical benefits to human health. In particular this project will develop technologies for neural prostheses which promise a new generation of therapies for the severely disabled to allow them to regain the ability to interact with the world. To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required. An interdisciplinary team including computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and neuroscientists will work in close concert to exploit existing infrastructure and experience with neural prostheses to address fundamental problems necessary for the practical application of these devices in humans.

"Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks to become independent as a neuroscientist and to work at the interface between neuroscience and physics. The Sloan-Swartz Center at UCSF provides a unique opportunity to become immersed in neuroscience at its cutting edge. While the majority of her time will be spent in research, she will attend a range of systems neuroscience and computer vision courses. The immediate goals of her research are to develop an information-theoretic method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non- Gaussian and have strong spatiotemporal correlations; and to use this method to analyze the responses of visual cortical neurons to natural time-varying images. There are numerous indications that the responses of neurons to natural stimuli cannot be completely predicted from their responses to stimuli with simple statistical properties, such as white noise ensembles. However, existing methods for analyzing single neuron responses may be rigorously applied only to Gaussian ensembles. The information-theoretic method involves finding the stimulus dimensions that carry the most information about the neuron's response. The stimulus ensemble is not assumed to be Gaussian.

"Embedded Tools for Processing Neural Ensembles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-electrode recording from ensembles of neurons in awake, behaving animals is a central technique for understanding the neural basis of behavior and nervous systems disorders, and a prerequisite to the creation of neural-controlled prostheses.

The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation.

The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.

Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6671314,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' learning', ' light intensity', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' sensory discrimination', ' sensory signal detection', ' visual feedback', ' visual perception', ' visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2003,229705,0.020505810219709
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6516620,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,358050,0.07375020464744701

The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks.

"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6539088,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior disorders', ' behavior prediction', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' decision making', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neuronal guidance', ' neurons', ' neuropsychology', ' online computer', ' performance', ' short term memory', ' space perception', ' stimulus /response', ' temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,249060,0.06655105318231663
"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                 dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal         mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in       addiction.                                                                        n/a",COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD,6495247,R01DA011723,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' dopamine', ' drug addiction', ' electrophysiology', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' reinforcer']",NIDA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2001,37627,0.030980879674176377

Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.

"PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Over the last decade             computational modeling has become central to neurobiology.  While much of        this work has focused on cellular and sub-cellular processes, the last few       years have seen increasing interest in systems level models and in               integrative accounts that span data from the subcellular to behavioral           levels.  Our proposal, in summary, is to extend existing work in parallel        discrete event simulation (PDES) and integrate it with existing work on          compartmental modeling environments, to produce a software environment which     has comprehensive support for modeling large scale, highly structured            networks of biophysically realistic cells; and which can efficiently exploit     the full range of parallel platforms, including the largest parallel             supercomputers, for simulation of these network models, which integrate          information about the nervous system from sub-cellular to the whole-brain        level.  Because of the scale of the models needed at this level of               integration, advanced parallel computing is required.  The critical              technical insight upon which this work rests is that neuronal modeling at        the systems level can often be reduced to a form of discrete event               simulation in which single cells are node functions and voltage spikes are       events.                                                                                                                                                           Three neuroscience modeling projects, will mold, test, and utilize these new     capabilities in investigations of system-level models of the nervous system      which integrate behavioral, anatomical and physiological data on a scale         that exceeds current simulation capabilities.  In collaboration with             computer scientists at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and UCLA,                neuroscientists at University of Virginia, the Born-Bunge Foundation,            Antwerp, and the Salk Institute, and developers of the NEURON and GENESIS        packages, these tools will be developed and made available to the                neuroscience community.  The software development aims include 1)                investigation of a portable, PDES system capable of running efficiently on       diverse parallel platforms, 2) development of interfaces to the PDES for         NEURON and GENESIS allowing models developed in those packages to be scaled      up, 3) investigation of a network specification language for neuronal            models, and associated a visualization interface, to facilitate                  investigation of systems-level models, 4) sufficiently robust and                well-documented software for download and installation at other sites.

"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6392761,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior disorders', ' behavior prediction', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' decision making', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neuronal guidance', ' neurons', ' neuropsychology', ' online computer', ' performance', ' short term memory', ' space perception', ' stimulus /response', ' temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2001,249900,0.06655105318231663
"NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES The PI is a Neurophysiologist and Pediatric Neurosurgeon who will be the         Associate Director of Center V (Behavioral and Neurobiology Research), with      special responsibility for Neurobiology programs, at the Children""s              Research Institute.  This RCA will permit the PI to devote nearly full time      to research.                                                                                                                                                      Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.                                                                                                                                                        The results of this research will fundamentally alter the way that neuronal      dynamics can be characterized and controlled, will provide a means to deal       with neuronal nonstationarity, will further explain the role of noise in         the nervous system, and may provide a novel approach for the control of          pathological neuronal ensembles in dynamical diseases such as epilepsy,          spasticity, and tremor.                                                           n/a",NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES,6185560,K02MH001493,"['artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' computational neuroscience', ' electric field', ' electroencephalography', ' extracellular', ' hippocampus', ' human data', ' intracellular', ' laboratory rat', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neurons', ' neurosurgery', ' noise', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,K02,2000,99063,0.07502072575249877
"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                 dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal         mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in       addiction.                                                                        n/a",COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD,6174750,R01DA011723,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' dopamine', ' drug addiction', ' electrophysiology', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' reinforcer']",NIDA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2000,154327,0.030980879674176377
"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6090371,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2000,123541,0.03831097357474968
"PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Over the last decade             computational modeling has become central to neurobiology.  While much of        this work has focused on cellular and sub-cellular processes, the last few       years have seen increasing interest in systems level models and in               integrative accounts that span data from the subcellular to behavioral           levels.

"THREE DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SYNAPSES DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Recent advances in               understanding neuronal functions have led to an expanded scientific interest     in defining the organization of the nervous system so the spatial correlates     of these functions can be identified.  This interest has been formalized as      the Human Brain Project, an ambitious multi disciplinary effort to map the       nervous system from the organismal to the macromolecular levels.  One of the     greatest challenges of this effort is to preserve the complex                    three-dimensional relationships that occur between neuronal structures.          This problem will require new methods for data acquisition as well as data       visualization.                                                                                                                                                    The project described here is an interdisciplinary effort to derive              three-dimensional reconstructions of synaptic architecture from stereo           electron micrographs acquired from multiple viewpoints.  The collaboration       combines advanced ultrastructural visualization techniques with massively        parallel computational methods and an innovative set of pattern recognition,     stereo correspondence and depth mapping algorithms.  Our goal is to              integrate structural information from numerous images into a single,             high-accuracy three-dimensional reconstruction of the synaptic cytoskeleton.     The immediate result of this collaboration will be an improved understanding     of the spatial relationships between synaptic macromolecules.  More              importantly, the project will produce a set of computational tools that can      be applied to stereo image data sets of various areas of the nervous system,     from the macroscopic to the molecular level.  Finally, our studies will          advance the state-of-the-art of parallel computation and interactive             reconstruction methods that can provide novel solutions to difficult             problems of neuroscience visualization.                                           n/a",THREE DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SYNAPSES,6185220,R01LM006326,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' brain mapping', ' cell cell interaction', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytoskeleton', ' data collection', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' macromolecule', ' method development', ' nerve endings', ' neurons', ' parallel processing', ' stereophotography', ' structural biology', ' synapses']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2000,117821,0.009853994519946821

Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6088130,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior disorders', ' behavior prediction', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' decision making', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neuronal guidance', ' neurons', ' neuropsychology', ' online computer', ' performance', ' short term memory', ' space perception', ' stimulus /response', ' temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2000,273575,0.06655105318231663
"Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery At the end of 2020, the IARPA MICrONS program will conclude with an automated reconstruction of all neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the neurons’ synaptic connectivity and calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. We believe that this dataset could become the most widely used resource in the field of cortical circuits, but more work is required to realize this potential. We propose to create an online community called Pyr (pronounced “peer”) that takes the result of MICrONS as its starting point. We propose to detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated segmentation through automated algorithms and human proofreading working in tandem. Automated error detection and correction will utilize hand-designed heuristics as well as deep learning and deep metric learning. Proofreading will be crowdsourced to nonscientist volunteers, a concept pioneered by Eyewire, but updated to handle a 1000x larger dataset and far more accurate artificial intelligence. We expect that Pyr will generate more cortical connections than any previous study, by orders of magnitude. This information will be accompanied by calcium-imaged visual responses of 80,000 neurons. With such an enormous and rich dataset, the primary bottleneck will become scientific discovery. We propose to crowdsource discovery by assembling a community of researchers who collaborate with Pyr and each other. Discovery infrastructure will include a “Science API” that allows programmatic access to the primary and derived data through Python functions, an automated system for “materializing” the connectome that makes the result of proofreading available to researchers with essentially zero delay, and a versioning system will insure that analyses are reproducible. We will create a framework enabling the community to contribute their own kinds of annotations, which will be included in materialization. Finally, we will build interactive discovery tools that couple Science API queries with visualization. We envision a community of researchers who will build upon the above discovery infrastructure, creating and sharing analysis tools of their own. They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons. Pyr will provide fundamental knowledge about normal function of the cortex, which is expected to be useful when studying mouse models of mental disorders.",Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery,10025901,RF1MH123400,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caring', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Continuing Education', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive load', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'heuristics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'online community', 'peer', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'visual coding', 'volunteer']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,6000000,0.037374032240652014
"A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States Project Summary Advances in neural recording technology now provide access to neural activity at high temporal resolutions, from many brain areas, and during complex and naturalistic behavior. Interpreting these types of high-dimensional and unconstrained neural recordings is still a major challenge in neuroscience. The aim of this project is to develop innovative methods for distilling high-dimensional neural activity patterns into simpler low-dimensional formats that can be effectively compared across time, conditions, or even across species. Our team is uniquely positioned to not only develop these novel methods, but also apply them to characterize changes in neural systems across a wide range of clinically-relevant perturbations, including addiction, sensory manipulation, and disease. In this project, theory, methods, and models will be developed for: 1) learning low-dimensional latent space models that align many neural datasets onto a common reference frame for comparison, 2) comparing datasets and testing the impact of a variety of perturbations (e.g. monocular deprivation, addiction and withdrawal) on the shape or geometry of neural activity from its baseline state, and 3) investigating the role of specific cell types and microcircuits on shaping population activity over time, during sleep, and in response to certain classes of perturbations. This project will provide new tools and frameworks for comparing neural datasets, leading to robust measures of disease, signatures of addiction, and other network-level reflections of environment and behavior. Significance: As neural datasets continue to grow in size, new methods for analysis are becoming of utmost importance in driving scientific understanding of the brain. The methods developed in this proposal will identify new ways to learn network-level signatures that allow us to link and compare different neural activity patterns. A robust ability to compare activity across time and animals will have wide reaching impacts, and provide new tools to advance network-level understanding of disease. Innovation: This project will leverage state-of-the-art approaches in high-dimensional statistics and geometry, which are simultaneously advancing in the context of deep learning (DL) architectures, and to tackle challenges in neural coding. This project represents a truly innovative combination of tools in machine learning and computational neuroscience which will likely transfer knowledge in both directions: from machine learning to neuroscience and back. The unique application of advanced mathematical tools in geometry and optimization to population-level analysis of perturbations will be transformative, not only for neuroscience but also in the study of DL architectures. Project Narrative Interpreting patterns of activity across large networks of neurons is an incredibly challenging problem that remains a key objective of the BRAIN initiative. This project will develop transformative methods for distilling neural activity patterns into compact, informative representations that facilitate comparison across datasets from different brain areas and multiple time-scales, and at different states of neurological disease.",A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States,10007243,R01EB029852,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'deprivation', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'monocular deprivation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,1000000,0.03409215875415852
"Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the first regions in the brain to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, and is important for object recognition, odor discrimination and episodic memory. Hence, early AD symptoms such as misplacing objects, forgetting events and loss of smell could be due to LEC dysfunction. In order to understand how Aβ and tau accumulation impacts the LEC neurons, we will use two mouse models of AD: APP knockin (APP-KI) mice- expressing physiological levels of APP and EC- APP/Tau mice- expressing elevated levels of APP and tau in the EC. Both mouse models show selectively vulnerability in the LEC, making them ideal candidates to probe LEC function. Our preliminary data shows behavioral impairment in the EC-APP/Tau mice at 24 months and data on APP-KI show impairment at 18 months. In the proposal we will evaluate LEC function in the younger mice in order to detect neuronal changes prior to behavioral deficits. We will record LEC activity with silicon probes and test responses towards objects, odors and passage of time. Using computational approach such as machine learning, we will determine if ensemble properties of LEC neurons are affected by tau and Aβ. We hypothesize that APP in the LEC of APP-KI mice will make the neurons dysfunctional which will be evident with poor decoding accuracy for objects, odors and temporal epochs. In the EC-APP/Tau mice, combined effect of Aβ and tau will make the dysfunction worse and affect the decoding accuracy further allowing better prediction of early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The proposal brings together diverse fields (electrophysiology, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques to record ensemble populations of neurons and develop analytical and predictive computational tests to interrogate function in a vulnerable brain region that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease. Inability to smell odors, misplacing items and confusion with events are some of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and pathology in the lateral entorhinal cortex of the brain could be the major cause for these early symptoms. By using sophisticated electrophysiological techniques and computational analysis, we will investigate the neurons of the lateral entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease mice and predict disease onset before cognitive symptoms appear.",Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning,10017142,R21AG066168,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Confusion', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Silicon', 'Smell Perception', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Perception', 'Training', 'abeta accumulation', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'computational neuroscience', 'digital', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'in vivo', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mouse model', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'object recognition', 'response', 'sugar', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual reality environment']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,202500,-0.036062567551560926
"Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit Work on learning in neural systems has focused largely on the effects of plasticity at synapses that provide direct input to the neurons being studied. Learning a model of the environment or a complex skill, however, relies on plasticity that is widely distributed and may occur at synapses far from the neurons driving decisions or actions. As is well-known from multi-layer (or 'deep') artificial networks, distributing learning over multiple layers is substantially more powerful but also more difficult to implement than learning at a single layer. The fact that computer scientists have solved such problems has revolutionized artificial intelligence and is rapidly reshaping the human world. Understanding how the brain solves such problems is, undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience today. However, progress along these lines has been slow, due in part to the high degree of complexity of learning and memory circuits in mammals, such as hippocampus and neocortex, that have been a major focus of research. This proposal applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to a system with unique advantages for understanding learning in multi-layer networks. The electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish is the site of a continual learning process that predicts and cancels self-generated sensory input in order to enhance detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Building on this knowledge, we propose to develop a model of the ELL spanning from cellular biophysics to network dynamics with the goal of explaining how synaptic plasticity widely distributed across processing layers and cell types gives rise to learning. To accomplish this, we will leverage cutting-edge approaches for mapping synaptic connectivity at high-resolution and monitoring neural population activity over the entire time course of learning. The proposed research is expected to yield general insight into how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. This proposal seeks to understand how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. To do this we will apply cutting-edge approaches for measuring activity in neuronal populations, mapping circuitry at high-resolution, and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system—the weakly electric mormryid fish. The research will produce a detailed computational model, spanning from biophysical to network levels, of how learning arises from synaptic plasticity that is widely distributed across processing layers and cell types.",Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit,10053457,R01NS118448,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mormyridae', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'skills']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1521512,0.05798217836092397
"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of “open source” models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,9874435,R21DC018374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'premonitory sensory phenomena', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2020,235500,0.011996661861896496
"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10157174,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Functional Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Wing', 'Work', 'appendage', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'male', 'markov model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroethology', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'peanut butter', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.048181534418709676
"Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema The goal of this proposed research is to reveal the sensory origins underlying the body schema representation. Body schema is the brain's internal model of the body's spatial configuration. This internal representation is critical for sensorimotor processing, movement control, and self-awareness, and is continuously updated during movement. Body schema representations are disrupted when somatosensory input is lost. The first step toward discover the neural correlates of body schema is to uncover neural mechanisms that generate body posture representation. We hypothesize that sensory inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are transformed to construct a body posture representation.  To delineate the mechanisms underlying the neural coding of body posture, this project will utilize large- scale monitoring, apply interventional tools, develop new data analysis tools, and integrate new approaches. Our approach is to perform large-scale electrophysiological recording and novel markerless tracking of 3D posture in freely moving mice. To track posture, the first aim is to adapt a markerless tracking pipeline comprised of a deep 3D convolutional neural network to process high-speed videography of mouse behavior from multiple cameras. The second aim is to perform large-scale recording of neurons in S1, S2, and PPC and use advanced computational approaches to determine which postural features best explain the activity of neurons in these cortical areas. Finally, the third aim is to use optogenetic and projection-specific manipulations to address the causal impact of proprioceptive inputs from S1 and S2 on coding of posture in PPC. This research promises to uncover how sensory inputs are involved in generating the body schema representation and guiding behavior.  Extensive training will be required to carry out this project and achieve my goal of earning a tenure-track professor position. The rigorous methodological and intellectual environment in Dr. Fan Wang’s lab and the Duke Neurobiology community will advance my conceptual knowledge and technical skills. I will implement deep learning techniques through training and collaboration with specialists. I will learn new techniques by attending Neuropixel and computational neuroscience courses. Finally, I will develop my professional skills by frequent attendance of seminars, workshops, and meeting with a postdoctoral mentorship committee.  The proposed project will be conducted in the Department of Neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Campus. This interdisciplinary community at Duke will bolster the research and training included in this application through frequent interaction with talented and collaborative faculty, organization of seminars and symposia, numerous opportunities to practice research talks and receive valuable feedback, formation of a personalized postdoctoral mentorship committee, extensive career and professional training, and invaluable support from the postdoctoral association. Project Narrative Body schema, the brain’s internal model of the spatial configuration of its body parts, is normally updated during movement, but can be disrupted following amputation, stroke, or deafferentation. Understanding how neural circuits generate body schema representation in health and disease could pave the way for improvements in surgical practice, stroke recovery therapy, brain-machine interface technology, and prosthetic limb engineering. Furthermore, sustaining an internal model of the body is a key element of awareness of one’s own body and the body of others, so findings on the sensory origins underlying body schema will have implications ranging from sensorimotor processing, motor control, interpersonal representations, and social cognition.",Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema,9987939,F32MH122995,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Analyses', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Experimental Models', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Self Perception', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'research to practice', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,37289,0.0020413682058842584
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9984554,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,384007,0.04375127661709924
"Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior ABSTRACT Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain. Exploratory behaviors are necessary for rodent survival in the natural world and ubiquitous in freely-moving rodent experiments. One neural circuit that may mediate natural exploratory behaviors are the projections from prelimbic cortex (PL, part of rodent prefrontal cortex) to ventral tegmental area (VTA). Stimulation of PL-VTA projections causes increased velocity but is not rewarding, despite the well-known rewarding effect of direct stimulation of VTA-dopamine neurons. Taken together with the fact that VTA has been implicated in exploration, my central hypothesis is that PL-VTA neurons mediate natural exploratory behaviors through downstream effects on a subpopulation of non-dopaminergic VTA neurons. To investigate this hypothesis, I will first develop an unbiased, machine-learning-based method to quantify untrained, freely-moving mouse behaviors (Experiment 1.1). My method will leverage multi-view, high resolution video, supervised body part tracking, and unsupervised machine learning-based postural clustering methods. I will use this method to identify which specific behaviors (rearing, walking, grooming, sniffing, etc.) are affected by optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of PL-VTA cells in the presence and absence of rewards (Experiment 1.2). Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of my behavioral quantification method and suggests that PL-VTA stimulation increases exploratory behaviors. Next, to identify the genetically- and target-defined VTA cells that are preferentially synapsed onto by PL projections, I will use a combination of optogenetics, in vitro electrophysiology, transgenic mice, and retrograde tracing. First, I will use transgenic mice to measure the functional strength of PL input specifically onto VTA cells that are dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic (Experiment 2.1). In a different set of mice, I will use retrograde tracing to identify if PL synapses preferentially onto VTA cells that project to nucleus accumbens or amygdala (Experiment 2.2). After learning which genetic and target-defined VTA subpopulations receive PL input, I will use retrograde tracing in combination with transgenic labeling to identify specifically which genetically and projection-defined VTA subpopulation receives PL input (Experiment 2.3). Finally, I will use a retrograde cre-dependent virus to selectively infect this VTA subpopulation with ChR2 and use my behavioral quantification pipeline to investigate whether in vivo stimulation of this subpopulation recapitulates the exploratory effects of PL-VTA stimulation (Experiment 2.4). Thus, the project proposed will develop a novel method for quantifying naturalistic behavior and integrate this computational method with diverse experimental methods, including in vivo and in vitro optogenetics, natural behavior, and synaptic physiology. These experiments will contribute novel information on how the PL-VTA circuit mediates naturalistic motor output, independent of the reinforcement effects of VTA-dopamine activity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain, but until recently methods for quantifying spontaneous behavior have been limited. I will develop a novel computational method for assessing how naturalistic exploratory behaviors are mediated by a subset of prefrontal cortex cells and the midbrain cells onto which they synapse. In total, this project will combine computational and experimental methods to map prefrontal-midbrain circuit and identify its effects on natural exploratory behavior.",Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior,10146550,F32MH125546,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Dopaminergic Cell', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Motor output', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Running', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Walking', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell cortex', 'cell type', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69926,0.04805366604343124
"CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging Neuroscience has been able to gain major insights by relating measurements of neural activity to the  brain’s sensory inputs and motor outputs. Yet most neural activity supports computations and cognitive functions (‘thoughts’) that are not directly measurable by the experimenter. The investigators for the  present proposal invented a novel method to model an animal's thoughts by combining eXplainable  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) cognitive models for naturalistic tasks with measurements of the animal’s  sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. This model, called Inverse Rational Control (IRC), infers the internal model assumptions under which an animal's actions would be optimal. It then provides estimates of time series of subjective beliefs about the world that are consistent with this internal model. These estimates provide targets for a dimensionality reduction framework that assesses task-relevant  computational dynamics within neural population activity. The investigators propose to use these analysis  tools to find neural representations and transformations that implement these cognitive processes. They will apply this to a complex, naturalistic task that they developed: catching fireflies in virtual reality. The  monkeys they successfully trained to perform this task demonstrably weigh uncertainty, develop  predictions and long-term strategies, and apply nonlinear dynamics — all computations that are  fundamental for brain function. The investigators propose first to apply their method to analyze existing behavioral data and neural recordings collected in a simple version of this task with a single target firefly.  They will then collect new data on a multi-firefly version of the task, which incentivizes animals to make and implement longer-term plans. To analyze this data, the investigators will generalize their approach to  allow them to learn which compressed representations are selected by the animal as the foundation for  their strategies. These results will be used to form predictions about neural computations that will be tested using the electrophysiological data collected from multiple brain regions during this project. The  results of this study will explain the computations required to perform a complex, strategic navigation task  in the presence of uncertainty, and will demonstrate a new paradigm for understanding naturalistic brain computations. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will uncover the neural basis of cognitive processes in the primate brain that underlie spatial  navigation, strategic planning, and behavioral control. It will demonstrate how a powerful new paradigm  for understanding complex, natural brain computations can apply to a wide variety of tasks, to explain  either adaptive or pathologically structured behavior. This will provide crucial guidance for understanding  and improving disrupted human cognitive function. n/a",CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging,10146521,R01NS120407,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Fireflies', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Instruction', 'Juice', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Utah', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'way finding']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,423814,0.0212477657594898
"Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue Abstract  How is connectivity between neurons related to patterns of activity exhibited by these neurons in vivo? This question of structure-function relations in brain circuits is of fundamental importance. Answering it in a quantitative manner would have far-reaching consequences both for our theories of how brain works and for applications ranging from better disease treatments to new tools for artificial intelligence. However, our current understanding of structure-function relations is relatively poor, in large part because the fine structure of neuronal connectivity has remained largely unknown. In turn, this severely limits connecting modeling to theoretical efforts. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of studying the highly heterogeneous cortical circuits, which are involved in important functions like perception, cognition, and learning.  Fortunately, recent experimental work by our collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science is now resulting in transformational new datasets that characterize connectivity in the mouse cortical area V1 at the level of Cell Types using multi-patch synaptic physiology and at the level of individual neurons using electron microscopy (EM). For the first time in history of neuroscience, we will have connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in ~1 mm3 of V1, plus systematic characterization of synaptic properties.  We will leverage these unique datasets to build and share with the community new models of V1 and use them to study the relationships between cortical connectivity and in vivo activity and computations. We will analyze how multiple features of neuronal code depend on individual cell properties and on higher-order connectivity motifs, which are present in the EM connectome, but not in the statistics-based connectivity inferred from sparse measurements at the Cell Types level or from existing literature. We also will evaluate the consistency of the new models of V1 with predictions made by current theories of structure-function relations.  These models and simulations will be freely shared with the community as a resource that scientists will use to guide future experiment designs, improve biological realism in models, and assist in generating and testing theories. By providing a rich and biologically realistic framework for new theoretical, modeling, and experimental studies, this resource will fuel new discoveries regarding relations between the structure and function of cortical circuits. To improve our understanding of the healthy brain as well as what breaks down in disease, it is essential to develop a quantitative, mechanistic description of how properties of neurons and their connections determine the properties of neural activity in vivo. This project will take advantage of unprecedented experimental datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science that contain a systematic characterization of synaptic connections between the cell types present and a connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in the mouse visual cortex. We propose to integrate these data into new, highly realistic network models of cortical circuits, use the models to explore theoretical predictions, and provide them as a resource to fuel future theoretical, modeling, and experimental work in the community.",Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue,10005712,R01EB029813,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,ALLEN INSTITUTE,R01,2020,600000,0.04835725352484997
"Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans PROJECT SUMMARY A diverse range of behaviors including language, event segmentation, and learning to play an instrument involve parsing complex temporal sequences. Item co-occurrence in a sequence can exist between pairs of items shown consecutively, as well as triplets, quadruplets and other higher order sets. For example, when learning a language both humans and natural language processing algorithms make use of first order statistics about which words tend to follow others, and higher-order statistics about the grammar of sentences and paragraphs. The statistics of this co-occurrence between sets of different sizes can influence how well people learn the sequence. We can demonstrate this learning by presenting stimuli in a sequence determined by a walk on a highly clustered graph where stimuli within a large cluster tend to co-occur more frequently than stimuli in different clusters. When subjects are shown motor cues generated from a walk on such a graph, they exhibit shorter reaction times and more similar BOLD activity for successive cues drawn from the same cluster than when they are drawn from different clusters. Generalizable theories of hippocampal function suggest that its role in learning and predicting abstract relationships could subserve this behavior. In line with this theory, neuroimaging data implicates the hippocampus and downstream cortical regions in this behavior. However, direct electrophysiological measures of neural activity during the performance of this task have not been examined, leaving the description of the neural underpinnings of the behavior incomplete. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that activity in the hippocampus reflects behavioral change across clusters, and is sensitive to higher-order associations between stimuli. Our investigation is an important next step in testing theories of how the hippocampus aids relational learning, and it will add to knowledge of how information in the world is represented in the brain and how it aids or hinders learning. PROJECT NARATIVE Identifying complex relationships between items in a sequence is a crucial component of learning in humans, and is thought to rely on activity in the hippocampus. However, the neural substrates that allow humans to learn higher-order statistics among stimuli in a sequence have not been fully explored, greatly limiting our understanding of sequential information encoding in the brain. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that hippocampal activity reflects these complex relationships between items, and tracks behavioral changes that demonstrate learning.",Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans,9991400,F31MH120925,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Distant', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Quadruplet Multiple Birth', 'Reaction Time', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Walking', 'discounting', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sequence learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories', 'way finding']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,-0.012365059780565447
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Project Summary of Work The purpose of this administrative supplement application is to provide support for Dr. Alexandra Bey, a psychiatry resident and neuroscience researcher, to expand her opportunities to carry out translational neuroscience research during her clinical training. By conducting the project outlined in this grant, Dr. Bey will gain invaluable experience in new scientific techniques, will study a behavior and its underlying neural dynamics extremely important to neuropsychiatric illnesses, and obtain personalized mentorship that will prepare her for an independent scientific career. To her accomplished skillset in molecular genetics and mouse behavior, she will develop electrophysiology and machine learning techniques in order to advance her ability to study neuronal circuits relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders. Through supervision by Dr. Kafui Dzirasa, Dr. Bey will receive intensive mentorship on experimental design, data analysis, manuscript publication, and grant-writing in order to prepare her to run a research group and compete for independent funding. Additionally, through regular counsel from a committee of preeminent clinician-scientists, Dr. Bey will obtain guidance and support for developing as a psychiatrist-neuroscientist as well as obtain relevant clinical exposure to patients with autism. Dr. Bey and Dr. Dzirasa have developed the following research project to investigate the neural dynamics of sleep. Furthermore, sleep as a behavior is quantifiable, translational, and frequently disrupted in many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. At present, there is very limited understanding of neural networks underlying sleep architecture. Dr. Bey’s experience with generating and characterizing different genetic mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders uniquely poise her to advance her skillset to include techniques to truly dissect neural circuits, networks, and their dynamics. Utilizing Dr. Dzirasa’s expertise in in vivo electrophysiology, our collaborator Dr. David Carlson’s expertise in machine learning, we will support Dr. Bey in her efforts to: 1) obtain multisite in vivo electrophysiological recordings in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disease during sleep and wake states, 2) utilize machine-learning algorithms to identify altered neural circuit oscillations contributing to sleep architecture, and 3) extend this work to include a clinically relevant genetic manipulation to examine gene x stress interaction on the dynamics of sleep. Dr. Bey will be a key contributor to the development of each of these experiments and through their conduct, will develop expertise in measuring and understanding neural circuit function which will allow her to advance her career in studying the neurobiological basis of autism. Project Narrative Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder.

"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,-0.0041065910959667004
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,10012952,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,134007,0.03050996197285766
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate.

"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease. There is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopy (EM) and correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy data. The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.  The reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutions. There is a strong need for next generation, well supported, integrated, easy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neurons, trace arbor branches, identify synapses, spines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time-consuming analyses in connectomic experiments. There is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data-driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discovery.  Powered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Rachel Wong and 9 additional labs, this project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysis (ICA) tool optimized for dense neuronal circuits. The tool will be commercially supported and integrated with DRVision’s flagship product Aivia to (1) provide accurate and automated neuron tracing in 3D EM and 3D fluorescence data up to multi-terabytes, (2) identify pre- and post-synaptic dendrite segments, (3) correlate light and electron microscopy data, quantify and classify neurons and sub-cellular components, (4) extract and analyze neuron circuits, (5) provide tools for phenotype discoveries, (6) seamlessly integrate the pipeline of ground truth (GT) annotation, editing, and machine learning workflow, and (7) access the required computing infrastructure, database connection, and exchange of data with other tools.

"Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors,9920206,K99MH117264,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Housing', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hunger', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'generalized anxiety', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2020,110754,0.01933620295158452
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation. Discovery in this area can  help improve understanding of neurologic disorders and development of new stimulation therapies. n/a",CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits,9978162,R01NS115327,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Closure by clamp', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventroposterior Medial Nucleus of the Thalamus', 'Vibrissae', 'awake', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'technology development', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,324660,0.02667350418957176
"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Dystonia', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Human', 'Image', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'awake', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'in vivo', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,0.02033573739631978
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory- experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way, I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,9871193,K99NS114194,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Dopamine', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'limb movement', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'motor behavior', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'supervised learning', 'theories']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,124157,0.05667072454417694
"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10041102,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,106190,-0.00423989327191825
"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9939507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334688,-0.033404844789875036
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions. Our methodology reveals various multiscale dynamical processes, relating measured neuronal activity to functional behavior, and has already uncovered activity patterns, dysfunction, and recovery stages.",Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling,10009336,R01EB026936,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Apical', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'behavior prediction', 'brain machine interface', 'computerized data processing', 'control theory', 'data fusion', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'denoising', 'experience', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'high dimensionality', 'mathematical methods', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensorimotor system', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,330552,0.060436851653630344
"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image. We will develop an integrative strategy, which combines advanced labeling, sample preparing, imaging and computing techniques to permit automated microconnectivity analysis in regular neurobiology labs. Our study on inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex will greatly advance the fundamental knowledge about how inhibition is formed. This is highly relevant to the circuitry mechanism of Autism Spectrum Disorder and many other neural disorder diseases, which are caused by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the brain.","Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain",10025817,RF1MH123402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cre driver', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'anatomic imaging', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'learning network', 'light microscopy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,RF1,2020,2900000,0.058618264646285466
"Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity PROJECT SUMMARY Dexterous food-handling is a critical but still poorly understood type of basic motor behavior. We propose an exploratory research program to investigate how the mouse uses its digits and forepaws to dexterously handle food. Preliminary results suggest that mouse food-handling movements, despite appearing extremely complex, can be decomposed into several types of simpler elements, tentatively identified as distinct and very rapid submovements that exhibit partly stereotyped and partly variable kinematic features. They also suggest that the mouse’s thumb (first digit, or D1; pollex) plays a surprisingly large and previously unrecognized role in dexterous food-handling. To explore these hypotheses and observations, we will first develop an approach for quantitatively characterizing seed-handling behaviors of freely moving mice. For this we will use high-speed, close-up video capture, combined with deep neural network methods for automated markerless tracking (DeepLabCut). We will then develop a novel trial-based paradigm for characterizing seed-handling under the more experimentally controlled conditions of head-fixation. We will combine this approach with tools for optogenetic silencing of either selectively targeted cortical areas or selectively labeled corticospinal neurons in motor cortex, as well as multi- probe/multi-channel linear array recordings of spiking activity in key nodes along sensorimotor pathways. Collectively this work will advance our understanding of the elemental movements involved in the dexterous manipulation of food, providing new insights into this process in a genetically tractable model organism, and opening the way for future studies to dissect the cellular mechanisms in sensorimotor circuits mediating specific aspects of forelimb and digit motor control. NARRATIVE The proposed research on dexterous forelimb behavior is directly relevant to public health because pathology in the neural circuits that mediate these behaviors severely impairs motor control. By elucidating fundamental aspects of these behaviors in a model mammalian organism, the mouse, this research can lead to new treatments of disease, and is thus relevant to those aspects of the NIH mission aimed at improving health through understanding pathophysiological mechanisms in disorders causing disability.",Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity,9982480,R21NS116886,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Mastication', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'free behavior', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,434500,0.015169413559739973
"CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning,9929660,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Structures', 'Animals', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Update', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fictional works', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'source guides']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387421,0.025875378742430347
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9914374,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,350000,0.03564256634830056
"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10153974,R01MH125571,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Capuchin Monkey', 'Choice Behavior', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Savings', 'Schizophrenia', 'Silicon', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wages', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral economics', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'preservation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,337222,0.035226781198001364
"A novel geometric paradigm for nonlinear modeling and control of neural dynamics PROJECT SUMMARY A standing challenge in neuroscience is to control the activity of large populations of interconnected neurons that underlie our brain’s functions and dysfunctions. The dynamics of these neural activity patterns are immensely complex and nonlinear, making their modeling extremely difficult. Thus, the precise control of neural dynamics and the associated mental states using stimulation input has remained elusive to date. If precise dynamic modeling and control was possible, this would both elucidate the neural basis of behavior and treat the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders such as depression or addiction, which are a leading cause of disability worldwide. The goal of this innovative proposal is to move toward making this vision a reality. We will: (1) develop a novel biologically-informed geometric paradigm to achieve nonlinear dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of neural population activity; (2) demonstrate it on brain network activity collected from the monkey motor system and the human corticolimbic system to characterize the neural dynamics of complex movements and control the neural biomarkers of depressed mood, respectively. This geometric paradigm will be based on a central idea: if we learn and model the low-dimensional nonlinear geometric space over which neural population activity evolves in time, we can then analytically write the dynamic model in a much simpler form over this manifold; this will allow for precise modeling of nonlinear dynamics and enable their control, which is otherwise impractical. Capturing the nonlinearity in the geometry to achieve control of brain dynamics with unprecedented precision is a major innovation and departure from current methods. We introduce concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry into neural dynamic modeling and control. We will develop new methods at the interface of these disciplines, neuroscience, machine learning and control theory to: (1) identify the type of manifold that embeds neural dynamics (e.g., torus or sphere); (2) develop novel algorithms that learn analytical dynamic models over this manifold (both with and without stimulation input); (3) build decoders and controllers of neural dynamics that incorporate the biologically-informed nonlinear geometric models. We will provide three rigorous experimental demonstrations on rich data from two distinct neural systems: (i) existing spike-field activity from monkey motor cortices during complex reach-and-grasps; (ii) existing multisite intracranial human brain activity in the corticolimbic system with simultaneous mood tracking; (iii) new closed-loop control experiments to selectively modulate brain network activity underlying mood states in the corticolimbic system using electrical stimulation. The paradigm will provide a new tool to build interpretable, low-dimensional, and controllable nonlinear models of neural dynamics to elucidate the neural basis of behavior and disease. Also, it will achieve nonlinear closed- loop control of neural dynamics underlying mental states and lead to closed-loop brain stimulation systems that could transform treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression or addiction for millions of patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed geometric paradigm for dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of nonlinear brain dynamics will provide a new scientific tool to study neural mechanisms in health and disease, and innovative closed-loop controllers of mental states with unprecedented precision to facilitate precisely-tailored stimulation treatments for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and addiction.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10005472,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,628430,0.05359323301273768

However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system — and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics — to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,10001592,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2020,2773998,0.021949778571439874
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,10016303,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'developmental prosopagnosia', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,265973,0.024294446971007546
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9904776,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2020,538317,0.029366470372220472
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9897551,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,403711,0.05721955229456822
"Impaired Astroglial Glutamate Signaling in Rett Syndrome ABSTRACT  Rett syndrome (RTT) is a leading cause of severe intellectual disability in women. Individuals with RTT develop  typically  until

"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,10001503,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,7509,0.0479452371852156
"Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness SUMMARY The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates (NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions. NARRATIVE This research advances our understanding of how the brain generates predictions which shape how we perceive the world, otherwise known as predictive coding. Predictive coding is relevant to public health because it holds great promise in conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, delirium and dementia, as well as understanding sleep and anesthesia. Progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of predictive coding, as well as predictive coding deficits, is a necessary step in developing more effective treatment strategies for multiple health conditions.","Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness",10034682,R01NS117901,"['Adrenergic Receptor', 'Agonist', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Disinhibition', 'Dose', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Propofol', 'Public Health', 'Pulvinar structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Study models', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Unconscious State', 'Update', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'paired stimuli', 'postsynaptic', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sedative', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'therapeutic development', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,517182,0.013963835238934926
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9852566,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'complex data ', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,510889,0.018032507706743577
"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission that pertains to reducing illness and disability.",Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity,10118759,R01NS115800,"['Age', 'Anions', 'Blindness', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cations', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Childhood Injury', 'Chlorides', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Edema', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurons', 'Newborn Infant', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Stroke', 'Swelling', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Water Movements', 'base', 'cell type', 'cytotoxic', 'deafness', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'drug development', 'excitotoxicity', 'extracellular', 'fluorophore', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'neonatal period', 'neonate', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'prevent', 'symporter', 'water channel', 'water flow']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,423191,-0.02151426223116762
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9930683,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2020,2983524,0.03506685910112831
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,9973904,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,645926,-0.008962315927410796
"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology Project Summary Listening in noise is a core problem in everyday hearing. Sound sources of interest routinely occur amid irrelevant distractors, as when you talk with someone in a bustling coffee shop. This background “noise” distorts the pattern of spikes in the auditory nerve, often to a profound degree. Thus, to recognize sources of interest, the auditory system must somehow separate or suppress the effects of the background. Typical human hearing is remarkably noise-robust, but listeners with age-related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and are not much helped by contemporary hearing aids. Previous work on the neural basis of noise robustness has typically employed simple, synthetic noise sources, which lack the structure present in real-world sounds, and this work has focused on subcortical regions or on primary auditory cortex. Reasoning that real-world conditions might necessitate more complicated solutions, in the applicant's doctoral work, he considered everyday sources of noise, and leveraged the large-scale coverage afforded by fMRI to examine noise robustness throughout human auditory cortex. Real-world “background noise” was operationalized as a natural sound with statistical properties that are stable over time (i.e., are stationary), conveying little new information about the world (e.g., swamp insects, an air conditioner, rain on pavement). The applicant measured fMRI responses in human listeners to a broad set of natural sounds presented in quiet, as well as embedded in the real-world background noises. Primary auditory cortical responses were substantially altered by the background, but non-primary responses were substantially more robust. This effect was not seen for simple synthetic backgrounds as had been used in previous work, suggesting that becoming robust to real-world background noises require different mechanisms. The applicant's thesis work demonstrates where noise invariance arises, but understanding how will require data with finer spatial and temporal resolution, and thus the proposed postdoctoral research will consist of training in single-unit electrophysiology using marmosets. Aim 1A builds on previous work examining single- unit noise robustness in artificial conditions, extending such work to real-world noise. Aim 1B leverages texture models to probe what aspects of real-world backgrounds disrupt the encoding of foregrounds. Aim 2A deploys linear reconstruction techniques to probe population representations. Aim 2B involves optimizing deep neural networks for noise invariance tasks, and using them as an encoding model to predict single-unit responses. Furthermore, such networks will be deployed as nonlinear decoding algorithms, reconstructing stimuli from neuronal populations. Throughout all aims, the work will characterize neuronal responses in non-primary areas, and in particular in parabelt, which is understudied in primates. The proposed work may enable improvements in hearing aid algorithms or neural prosthetics. Lastly, this training will lay the groundwork for the applicant's long-term goal of developing a marmoset model for hearing loss. Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,10104430,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,64926,0.016817612076089183
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9944496,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing Tests', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,337875,-0.013807454146843711
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This project will develop an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms of timed motor behavior by combining large-scale neural recordings from multiple brain areas and computational modeling of neural networks. n/a",CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses,10017326,R01NS100050,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'computer framework', 'conditioning', 'driving force', 'dynamic system', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'motor behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pressure', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'support vector machine', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,296942,0.06107273146247026
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,9991417,F32MH123012,"['ARNT gene', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Cloning', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73010,0.05524043084089858
"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders. This work on the fundamental nature of the neural code will contribute to the body of knowledge required to create effective brain interfaces for motor and sensory prostheses with the potential to reduce sensory disabilities, provide treatments for cognitive disorders, and aid in recovery from central nervous system trauma.",Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations,10006552,R00EY028612,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Population Statistics', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Disorders', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic CNS injury', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual Cortex', 'Washington', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'clay', 'computational neuroscience', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'mathematical methods', 'millisecond', 'neural model', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory prosthesis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,0.024605152596346245
"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10050798,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Structure', 'ImProv', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vector']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,373940,0.022091682352952766
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,10015338,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2020,126090,0.05823045831470087
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,10026026,F31NS113385,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Endoscopes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Postural adjustments', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Stereotyping', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'calcium indicator', 'complement pathway', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'indexing', 'microendoscopy', 'miniaturize', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2020,33352,0.017642779794393666
"CRCNS: Real-time neural decoding for calcium imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Chen, Rong PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Real-time neural decoding centers on predicting behavior variables based on neural activity data, where the prediction is performed at a pace that reliably keeps up with the speed of the activity that is being monitored. Neuromodulation devices are becoming one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of brain disorders, enhancing neurocognitive performance, and demonstrating causality (Bergmann et al., 2016; Knotkova and Rasche, 2015). A precise neuromodulation system (Figure 1) integrates neural activity monitoring, real-time neural decoding, and neuromodulation. In precise neuromodulation, a decoding device predicts a behavior variable based on neural data streams in real-time. Based on the decoding results, neuromodulation parameters such as timing, frequency, duration, and amplitude are changed. Precise neuromodulation systems with closed-loop real-time feedback are superior to the fixed (open- loop) neuromodulation paradigm (Brocker et al., 2017; deBettencourt et al., 2015; Ezzyat et al., 2017). A recent direct brain stimulation study (Ezzyat et al., 2017) demonstrated significant advantages of precise neuromodulation over open-loop neuromodulation. Ezzyat et al. applied direct brain stimulation with decoding capability to patients with epilepsy to improve their memory. They found that stimulation increased memory function only if delivered when the decoding device indicated low encoding efficiency while stimulation decreased memory function if delivered when the decoding device indicated high encoding efficiency. An open-loop neuromodulation system with a fixed stimulation paradigm may not always facilitate memory function.  Miniature cellular imaging (Ghosh et al., 2011; Kerr and Nimmerjahn, 2012; Scott et al., 2013) is one of the most powerful ways to study neural circuits. It enables us to investigate neural circuits during behaviors for an understanding of network architecture of behavior, cognition, and emotion. Miniature cellular imaging records neuronal activity at cellular and sub-second levels of spatial and temporal resolution in freely moving animals. Miniature cellular imaging has many advantages. First, compared with in vivo multi-electrode recording, miniature calcium imaging can probe all cells in the field of view, and visualize the spatial location of monitored cells (Kerr et al., 2005). Second, compared with magnetic resonance imaging, which measures brain activity at the macroscopic scale and with low temporal resolution, miniature cellular imaging provides high spatial and temporal resolution. Third, fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2014) lacks cellular-level resolution, while miniature cellular imaging allows concurrent tracking of neural calcium activities at cellular spatial resolution.

"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9983641,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,279706,0.06801874928456599
"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex.

"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.030937087212958684
"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis. We aim to test our central hypothesis that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence that supports multiple confidence-guided behavioral processes.",Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence,10058676,R01MH097061,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Wages', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'deaf', 'design', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sound', 'success']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,500079,0.03473990053455479
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9994009,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,129087,0.047518186312899606
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9955382,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'squid axon', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,386750,0.09045202335419915
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9842566,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,202500,0.0334856033348105
"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,9912748,R01EY011787,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amblyopia', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'cell type', 'cortical visual impairment', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'mouse genetics', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'photoactivation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-photon', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2020,395525,0.053219665315971866
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9983219,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1025216,0.026042874643777046
"Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior Project Summary/Abstract In order to control specific behavioral responses, transcriptionally distinct cell types assembled into dynamic brain circuits integrate environmental information with internal states and generate purposeful motor actions. While tools have been developed to independently measure the activity dynamics, connectivity and transcriptional profiles of individual neurons, it remains challenging to integrate this diverse information into a coherent model of behavior. To address this challenge, we aim to uncover the sensorimotor transformations leading to a complex naturalistic behavior, male and female parenting, by developing innovative molecular, imaging and systems-level approaches and by integrating multimodal information obtained from single neurons in behaving animals. In aim 1, we will develop new tools to uncover the activity and the transcriptional identity of neuronal cell types involved in infant-mediated behavior. In aim 2, we will explore in molecular, functional, and behavioral terms how olfactory and other sensory modalities underlie parenting behavior in males and females and in virgin versus mated states. In aim 3, we will investigate how specific hypothalamic cell types process information reflecting behavioral outcomes using a combination of spatial transcriptomic, functional imaging, circuit tracing and behavioral methods. In aim 4, we will combine cell-type based neuronal architecture with activity patterns across key brain regions to formulate predictive models underlying the neural control of parenting. Project Narrative We propose to develop a transformative multimodal experimental platform to uncover the brain-wide architecture of neuronal circuits underlying parenting behavior in molecular, functional, connectivity-based and computational terms. We will use this experimental framework to shed light into the sensory motor transformation underlying parenting behavior as a function of the animal sex and physiological state.",Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior,9971196,R01NS116593,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Child Rearing', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Discipline', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instinct', 'Investigation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'male', 'microendoscopy', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuroregulation', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'predictive modeling', 'pup', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2444289,0.061051709585286495
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes. This work forms a basis to study central alterations following noise- induced hearing loss or other cochlear pathology, and gain deeper understanding of all auditory structures from brainstem to cortex.",The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus,9898347,R01DC015901,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biophysics', 'Birds', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'CNS processing', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear nucleus', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Octopus', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'afferent nerve', 'auditory processing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell type', 'cellular targeting', 'connectome', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'granule cell', 'health goals', 'human error', 'in silico', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular scale', 'nanoscale', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recombinase', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory system', 'sound', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R01,2020,620597,-0.004600173027856618
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9983177,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2020,3062362,0.04184449233729107
"2/2 Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers associated with the development of psychiatric disorders In this project, we will develop novel methods for finding brain-specific enhancers, build regulatory networks, deconvolve brain-region-specific regulation, and relate differential enhancer signals to variations in the human population.
