"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9600692,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,568221,0.06958301845922141
"An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposed project is to examine the feasibility of an individualized vocabulary intervention program for preschool dual language learners (DLL) from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. Children who grow up in low SES and language minority homes (L1) and learn English (L2) as a second language in school settings are likely to be at risk for reading difficulties and poor academic performance (e.g., August et al., 2006). In order to serve the particular needs of DLLs from diverse backgrounds, scientific evidence is critically needed about the intervention strategies for these preschoolers. In this proposed study, we examine the feasibility of using machine learning methods to generate individually tailored interventions for low SES dual language learners who learn two typologically different languages, Cantonese (L1) and English (L2). Two important strategies will be used in this study. First, a computation model will be built to predict and select appropriate bilingual target words for individual DLLs. Second, this intervention will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps. There are two specific aims in this proposed study: 1. Model normative lexical development in Cantonese-English DLLs. We will leverage  data previously collected by Dr. Kan on Cantonese-English vocabulary development at  Head Start Centers, and computational models of typical lexical development in monolingual  English speakers, to build a computational model of typical bilingual lexical development in  Cantonese-English dual language learners. 2. Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a model-based individualized vocabulary  intervention program. We will use the computational model to make individual level target  word recommendations for 200 Cantonese-English DLLs, and work with teachers at 8 Head  Start centers to integrate the recommendations into their existing curriculum. The goal of this project is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of using machine learning methods to develop an individualized, personalized vocabulary intervention programs for preschool dual language learners from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The individualized intervention program for each child will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps.",An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners,9771334,R21HD092837,"['Address', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Head Start Program', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Testing', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'follow-up', 'intervention program', 'kindergarten', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'low socioeconomic status', 'peer', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'reading difficulties', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'teacher']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R21,2019,186473,0.04068157107273532
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan. Â  Â  Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.

"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication â the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems â semantics, phonology, and sentence planning â are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering. Using large existing neuroimaging datasets obtained in these disorders will allow us to address important questions about the causes and consequences of these developmental disorders.",Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders,9757857,F32DC017637,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Stuttering', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'caudate nucleus', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'language impairment', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'standardize measure']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,F32,2019,65354,0.01115702783329023
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9614566,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2019,438611,0.0285022658355911
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk.

"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicantâs long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9836112,F31DC018220,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Control Groups', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endowment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exclusion', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'literacy', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'trait', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2019,40450,0.0017135599079838926
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9731439,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2019,39939,0.07955492707916885
"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimerâs disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimerâs disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided âdefinitiveâ evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,9674437,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,557010,0.020435714856868837
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9674421,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,2193618,-0.009375254102822602
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9684602,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,608110,0.06792115387086037
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a childâs ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9788034,F32DC017373,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'farmer', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'peer', 'preservation', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2019,22217,0.009256441916125362
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. âLate Talkersâ are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills. Â  Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9729661,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,606922,0.0739903729517017
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors â a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individualâs independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimerâs disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individualâs quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9390046,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,578454,0.06958301845922141
"An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposed project is to examine the feasibility of an individualized vocabulary intervention program for preschool dual language learners (DLL) from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. Children who grow up in low SES and language minority homes (L1) and learn English (L2) as a second language in school settings are likely to be at risk for reading difficulties and poor academic performance (e.g., August et al., 2006). In order to serve the particular needs of DLLs from diverse backgrounds, scientific evidence is critically needed about the intervention strategies for these preschoolers. In this proposed study, we examine the feasibility of using machine learning methods to generate individually tailored interventions for low SES dual language learners who learn two typologically different languages, Cantonese (L1) and English (L2). Two important strategies will be used in this study. First, a computation model will be built to predict and select appropriate bilingual target words for individual DLLs. Second, this intervention will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps. There are two specific aims in this proposed study: 1. Model normative lexical development in Cantonese-English DLLs. We will leverage  data previously collected by Dr. Kan on Cantonese-English vocabulary development at  Head Start Centers, and computational models of typical lexical development in monolingual  English speakers, to build a computational model of typical bilingual lexical development in  Cantonese-English dual language learners. 2. Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a model-based individualized vocabulary  intervention program. We will use the computational model to make individual level target  word recommendations for 200 Cantonese-English DLLs, and work with teachers at 8 Head  Start centers to integrate the recommendations into their existing curriculum. The goal of this project is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of using machine learning methods to develop an individualized, personalized vocabulary intervention programs for preschool dual language learners from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The individualized intervention program for each child will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps.",An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners,9530276,R21HD092837,"['Address', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Head Start Program', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Testing', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'follow-up', 'intervention program', 'kindergarten', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'low socioeconomic status', 'peer', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'reading difficulties', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'teacher']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R21,2018,221909,0.04068157107273532
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Additional aims are to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment and identify the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of using modern neuroimaging techniques.",Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis,9596726,R01DC016800,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavioral neurology', 'clinical investigation', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'predicting response', 'primary outcome', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,609151,0.09750392372628608
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9522332,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,666236,0.06454592743013324
"Neural Predictors of Language Outcomes in Young Children with Cochlear Implants Impressive advances in cochlear implant (CI) technology in recent years have placed within our grasp the possibility of developing spoken language. However, one remaining question is why CI children as a group still perform below their normal-hearing peers and why performance varies across individuals. In searching for the sources of language development variability in young CI children, our proposed study will also seek to construct clinically useful models that capitalize on pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures for predicting post-surgical language development outcomes at the individual level. At the Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, we have collected pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures and post-surgical speech outcome data from about 130 (70 prospectively and 60 retrospectively) subjects over the past five years. We also conducted a preliminary study that demonstrates that individual patients can be classified into better or poorer language improvers six months post-surgery by a machine-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on neuroanatomical measures established pre-surgery. Our proposed study will seek to extend this preliminary research by: (1) continuing data collection and analyzing a larger set of neural measures and outcome data up to two years post-surgery, and (2) testing the generalizability of the predictive models built in Chicago to CI patients of similar characteristics at the Mayo Clinic and the University of Michigan in order to evaluate the models' broader clinical utility. Our studies will be constructed to test two competing hypotheses. The neural preservation hypothesis postulates that brain regions that are unaffected by hearing loss contribute most to language development outcomes, and that they most likely encompass auditory association areas and cognitive brain regions. The neural cycling hypothesis argues that post-surgical language development relies on the recovery of the brain regions that are most affected by hearing loss, most likely in the primary auditory cortical regions. If successful, our predictive models could immediately be deployed to augment current clinical practice, because they concern patient outcome at the individual level. Ultimately, our predictive information will allow clinicians and parents to plan more carefully for post-surgical therapy and to identify personalized management strategies for individual children. Our study directly addresses Priority Area 3 in Hearing and Balance Research of the latest NIDCD Strategic Plan. Â  Â  Although cochlear implants have allowed better spoken language development in early-deafened children, the language and cognitive abilities of these children continue to lag behind those of their normal-hearing peers. The proposed study will seek to use pre-surgical neural and behavioral measures to predict post-surgical language outcomes in young children who have received a CI in order to assist in better post-surgical planning and the optimization of therapy.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9612777,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2018,39939,0.07955492707916885
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided âdefinitiveâ evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,9461502,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,607626,0.020435714856868837
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9470863,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,606853,0.06792115387086037
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9455467,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2018,2212889,-0.009375254102822602
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a childâs ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9609288,F32DC017373,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'farmer', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'peer', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2018,58282,0.009256441916125362
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. âLate Talkersâ are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills. Â  Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9506574,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,606922,0.0739903729517017
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis,9393259,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multilingualism', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,268713,0.08986173020201751
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individualâs independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimerâs disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individualâs quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9564053,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,709956,0.012114338765468908
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9191358,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,602469,0.06958301845922141
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided âdefinitiveâ evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,9311162,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,608789,0.020435714856868837
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9244766,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2017,2210408,-0.009375254102822602
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9307257,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,636163,0.06792115387086037
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. âLate Talkersâ are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills. Â  Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9297279,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,606922,0.0739903729517017
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis,9234982,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multilingualism', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,293203,0.08986173020201751
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individualâs independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimerâs disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individualâs quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.                ",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9020029,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Only Child', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Sign Language', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,638494,0.06958301845922141
"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9083041,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'wasting']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2016,2291632,-0.009375254102822602
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,8984169,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aphasia', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Child', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discourse analysis', 'Educational workshop', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'lexical', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,270581,0.08967288449723579
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. âLate Talkersâ are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills. Â  Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9172394,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,606922,0.0739903729517017
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment. The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.",Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development,8852664,R01HD067364,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Assimilations', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'English Learner', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'bilingualism', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories']",NICHD,"HASKINS LABORATORIES, INC.",R01,2015,576358,0.045959404506984346
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,8787131,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Child', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'lexical', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,268514,0.08967288449723579
"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8852594,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comprehension skill', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,194301,0.026674083464836167
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.                ",Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication,8876473,R01DC009834,"['21 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Movement', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'P300 Event-Related Potentials', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Running', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive system', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'engineering design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mindfulness meditation', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'residence', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skills', 'spelling', 'statistics', 'syntax', 'technology development', 'time interval', 'usability', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,665012,0.027315111178708825
"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.",Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language,8793776,R01DC007646,"['Acquired Alexia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agraphia', 'Alexia', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Modality', 'Oral', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Semantics', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Third-Party Payer', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'Writing', 'aphasia rehabilitation', 'behavioral outcome', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical retrieval', 'literate', 'novel', 'phonology', 'response', 'scaffold', 'skills training', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment planning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,386939,0.0892049645623298
"Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive control allows individuals to adjust thoughts and actions on-the-fly upon discovering conflict across informational sources during processing; it is therefore critical to both memory and language functions (e.g., recognizing objects correctly despite interfering memoranda; recovering from temporary misinterpretation during reading or spoken language comprehension). The overall objective of this project is to understand the interplay among multiple cognitive systems, whether the same cognitive control functions operate systematically across conflict types that arise in different domains, and to characterize the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie their interaction. In doing so, this research will contribute to our knowledge about shared language and memory functions and the extent to which cognitive control engagement in one domain influences performance in another. Specifically, this proposal tests whether the experience of information conflict within memory alters subsequent conflict-control procedures in language processing, ultimately deriving quantitative assessments of these effects in both brain and behavior. This project has three specific aims. The first is to test how the experience of information-conflict during non- linguistc task performance (and thus the engagement of cognitive control) affects real-time language processing, indexed by eye-movement patterns to objects in a scene as listeners carry out spoken instructions. Experiment 1 harnesses the phenomenon of ""conflict adaptation"" (wherein conflict detection triggers cognitive control to facilitate conflict resolution on a subsequent tril) to examine whether listeners dynamically adjust language processing behavior (e.g., easier recovery from misinterpretation) following conflict detection in the Stroop task, a classic cognitive control measure. Second, this proposal examines neurobiological changes during language processing depending on whether cognitive control has been triggered by a preceding conflict trial outside the syntactic domain. Experiment 2 utilizes single-trial analysis of fMRI daa to form a quantitative link between fMRI signal amplitude and both eye-tracking and behavioral indexes of resolving syntactic ambiguity. Third, this proposal investigates the extent to which a wide range of ostensibly different tasks share a common conflict-control mind state. Experiment 3 includes a battery of memory and language tasks with high cognitive control demands to test whether machine-learning algorithms (i.e., multi-voxel pattern analysis, or MVPA) can accurately classify conflict states broadly across domains. The proposed experiments adopt converging eye-tracking and neuroimaging techniques (single-trial and multivariate analyses) to help address a central issue in cognitive science: how language processing is relatively affected by the engagement status of the cognitive control system. Because cognitive control deficits affect patients' memory and language performance alike, elucidating the dynamic interplay between these cognitive systems has major health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results from this research will inform an understanding of common language and memory functions in the human mind and brain, insights that can be applied to public knowledge about how various cognitive systems develop typically and atypically during childhood, and how they fail following injury to the underlying neurobiological structures. Critically, we will be able to draw conclusions about the malleability (or causal nature) of certain language and memory processes, findings that can ultimately be disseminated to and used in clinical, educational, and government settings.                ",Dynamic behavioral and neural effects of cognitive control on language processing,8714196,F32HD080306,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'conflict resolution', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'memory process', 'mind control', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'stimulus processing', 'syntax']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",F32,2014,57782,0.02579205349190853

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8642022,F31DC013204,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agrammatism', 'Aphasia', 'Attention', 'Brain Injuries', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perceptual learning', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'aphasia rehabilitation', 'aphasic', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language training', 'learning ability', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'sequence learning', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,35352,0.07683415793445336
"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.            ",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8764466,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,234765,0.026674083464836167

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.  If successful, the new methods will have important impacts on research and clinical practice for ASD and for other disorders in which language is affected, by enabling analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples as well as by creating opportunities for discovery of currently unknown language characteristics of ASD by the effortless extraction of numerous language features.        Although atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown, in part due to the paucity of instruments for the analysis of natural language samples.

The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8522948,F31DC013204,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agrammatism', 'Aphasia', 'Attention', 'Brain Injuries', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perceptual learning', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'aphasia rehabilitation', 'aphasic', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language training', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'sequence learning', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,34908,0.07683415793445336
"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia  Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.  PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.",Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia,8247172,R03DC010878,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Agrammatism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Atrophic', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Functional Aphasias', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantic Dementias', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'syntax']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2012,121968,0.06561735935809879

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.           The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.           More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. Benchmarks will be established to emphasize the direct competitive teasting of competing hypotheses from alternative theoretical and methodological positions. n/a",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,7813998,R01HD051698,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Child', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'digital', 'disability', 'lexical', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,223419,0.026767534570517122
"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI).

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.              PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Tools for Automated Assessment of Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders including Developmental Language Disorders (DLD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). It is increasingly recognized that assessment should include spontaneous natural language samples. There are measures, such as the Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), which are laborious to apply, since they require manual analysis of a corpus of sentences collected from the child. There is therefore a strong need for automated tools to aid clinicians in this task, and to provide more robust analyses for assessment. Many widely-used commercial software packages, such as the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) do little more than count linguistic features, and still require someone to code those features. Fully automated systems, such as Computerized Profiling (CP) do exist, but reports vary on how well they work. However, recent advances in natural language processing, in particular in the realm of grammar adaptation, mean that we are now able to produce high-quality commercial software that can be used by clinical practitioners in their assessment of child language. This project will build a commercially viable suite of fully automated, software-based tools, requiring no special equipment beyond a standard personal computer, targeted at clinicians who work with children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The system will have been evaluated not only with children with Typical Development (TD), but with data from children with ASD and DLD. The system will include the following components: (1) text normalization tools to help with the clean up and normalization of transcriptions; (2) a state -of-the-art part-of-speech tagger; (3) a state-of-the-art morphological analyzer; (4) a state-of-the-art syntactic parser; (5) a dependency analyzer and semantic-role labeler, (6) a scoring module to take the output of the language analysis, and map this to the IPSyn or other scales. The software will be written in C++ and Java, and will adopt a rigorous industrial coding style, namely the Google style guide, which is in the public domain. As part of an NIH-funded project on Autism, the Center for Spoken Language Understanding, in collaboration with colleagues at Yale University, has collected a corpus of video and audio recorded interactions of children with ASD and DLD, as well as TD children ages 4-8. In this STTR-funded project, we will perform a manual IPSyn assessment on these data and provide the results as a benchmark on how well the system will perform in the field. While the target language for the initial development will be English, the software will be written in a fully language-independent fashion, in that no properties of English will be hard-coded into the system. All that would be required to 'port' the system to a new language would be appropriate training material for the language.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders, and it is increasingly recognized that assessment should involve the analysis of spontaneous language samples. This project will develop a package of software programs for the automatic analysis of spontaneous language samples from children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The program will be usable directly by clinicians in their assessment of patients.          n/a",Tools for Automated Assessment of Language,7800817,R41DC010502,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Benchmarking', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Language', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Java', 'Language', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Personal Computers', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Special Equipment', 'Speech', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'computerized', 'indexing', 'natural language', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,"BIOSPEECH, INC.",R41,2009,198687,0.056923948980838086
"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment. The findings from this research will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the language learning in children with language impairments, and will aid the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with language impairments who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure.          n/a",Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment,7659525,R01DC005650,"['9 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Development', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Habits', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Secondary to', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'implicit memory', 'improved', 'insight', 'lexical', 'motor skill learning', 'novel', 'procedural memory', 'public health relevance', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'syntax', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,308285,0.024707089191905743
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.

"An Accessible, Effective Treatment for Sentence Deficit in Agrammatic Aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our work is to develop an accessible, effective and cost effective speech and language treatment for aphasia. To achieve this goal, we will develop a commercial prototype of a computer program called Sentactics based on over 15 years of research at Northwestern University that demonstrates the effectiveness of the program to improve speech production and comprehension skills of individuals with aphasia. Preliminary work funded by the NIH resulted in an initial version of the Sentactics program. A clinical trial revealed that individuals with agrammatic aphasia who used Sentactics improved their speech and language production and comprehension skills significantly, with gains equivalent to subjects who were administered the clinical treatment from expert human clinicians. This study also demonstrated that individuals with aphasia find the Sentactics program to be highly engaging and fun to use. Our project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a commercial prototype of an improved version of Sentactics that incorporates two new features: (a) a spoken language system that uses speech and natural language processing technologies to provide feedback to clients about the accuracy of their speech productions, and (b) a clinician oversight capability that enables individual clinicians to use the internet to monitor multiple simultaneous users of the program and communicate with individual users as needed. In Phase I of the project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of using the spoken language system to provide feedback to clients about the accuracy of their speech productions. In Phase II we will develop a commercial prototype of the program incorporating the spoken language system and clinician oversight functions. We will then field test the program with individuals with aphasia. We will compare changes in the speech production and comprehension abilities of individuals using the Sentactics program to individuals using a commercially available program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful outcomes of this project would result in a commercial prototype of an accessible, affordable, effective and easy to use speech and language therapy program for use by individuals with aphasia in clinics or homes. This project addresses a great national need for inexpensive, intensive, extensive, effective treatments for millions of individuals with aphasia.                        Relevance Successful outcomes of this project would result in a commercial prototype of an accessible, affordable, effective and easy to use speech and language therapy program for use by individuals with aphasia in clinics or homes.

"Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project tests specific hypotheses about dependencies between language comprehension and production, which are typically studied independently. The PI's production-distribution-comprehension (PDC) account holds that utterance planning choices during language production yield distributional patterns in the language, in which certain syntactic structures co-vary with particular word choices, messages, and discourse environments. Comprehenders, through statistical learning during prior comprehension experiences, become highly sensitive to these patterns, and this sensitivity guides comprehension processes. Thus, many aspects of comprehension can ultimately be traced to task demands related to language production. Specific aims of the project include: (1) Link syntactic structure choice in production to mechanisms of sentence planning. (2) Compare the PDC account of comprehension to alternative views of relative clause interpretation. (3) Test the causal relations between production constraints, distributional patterns in the language, and comprehension performance. (4) Relate adult sentence comprehension to statistical learning. (5) Test the current limits of constraint-based models of language comprehension. The PDC approach offers a significant alternative to other views and also may inform language acquisition research by illuminating the role of distributional patterns in child language acquisition. The work also can inform language therapies for brain injured patients in several ways. First, sources of production difficulty are precisely investigated, as are accommodations that unimpaired speakers make in the face of this difficulty. Second, the project investigates the relationship between prior experience with a syntactic construction and comprehension difficulty, which can have implications for the amount and nature of practice that should be provided to patients to improve their comprehension of certain sentence types.         n/a",Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns,7426941,R01HD047425,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Characteristics', 'Child Language', 'Collaborations', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Foxes', 'Human Characteristics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'infancy', 'injured', 'insight', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'preference', 'research study', 'statistics', 'stem', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,164747,-0.01083814067875492

Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. Benchmarks will be established to emphasize the direct competitive teasting of competing hypotheses from alternative theoretical and methodological positions. n/a",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,7265230,R01HD051698,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Series', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'digital', 'disability', 'lexical', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,234683,0.026767534570517122

"Analysis and Remediation of Language Production DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aphasia strikes approximately one in 250 Americans. The reduced ability to communicate with language represents, in most cases, a catastrophic loss of self-sufficiency and a source of profound social isolation. No treatment for aphasia reported to date has reliably brought about changes in language production that migrate from highly constrained laboratory tasks such as single picture description to more challenging and socially functional tasks such as the production of entire narratives. The current climate in health care limits access to speech therapy, and thus it is imperative to develop approaches to treatment which allow patients to supplement 1:1 clinical treatment with intensive independent home practice. We have developed two computer programs to address the need for effective aphasia treatments that can be used semi-independently. One is a communication system (CS), which allows aphasic users to record spoken sentences a single word or phrase at a time, to replay these words or phrases, and to build them into sentences and narratives by manipulating visual icons on a computer screen. The other program is a language therapy system (TS) incorporating speech recognition and natural language understanding technology, which allows the computer to 'understand' the patient's spoken sentence and to provide feedback about whether it correctly describes a picture on the screen. This allows independent home practice of spoken language. The goals of this project are: (1) to replicate pilot results showing measurably more structured language production by aphasic patients using the CS, and to link these effects to characteristics of subjects' language processing impairments (Exp. 1); (2) to assess the impact of enhancing the CS with word-finding support for more severely impaired patients (Exp. 2); (3) to replicate the positive outcomes in pilot studies which used the TS and CS to improve aphasic patients' spoken language production, and to use the TS to train subjects on grammatical structures that provide tests of specific hypotheses about the impact of impaired short term memory on aphasic production (Exp. 3); and (4) to use data automatically collected by the CS to investigate the nature of the underlying disruption and to motivate the most effective approaches to remediation (Exp. 4). Information obtained from these studies will provide a basis for the further development of novel, theoretically motivated approaches to aphasia treatment. n/a",Analysis and Remediation of Language Production,7188572,R01DC005629,"['Address', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disruption', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social isolation', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Therapy', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'analytical method', 'aphasic', 'base', 'computer program', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical retrieval', 'novel', 'phonology', 'programs', 'remediation', 'size', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2007,337888,0.06765964712871743

"Neural Network Models of Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is characterized by alterations of language and inferential processes. In spite of extensive research, core mechanisms of these disturbances remain uncertain. The overall objective of this RO1 proposal is to use DISCERN, a neural network simulation of natural language processing (Miikkulainen & Dyer 1991; Miikkulainen 1993, 1998), to investigate the mechanism(s) of language-based disturbances in schizophrenia. DISCERN learns stories, utilizes inferential processes, replies to questions, and produces coherent, multi-sentence narrative paraphrases of episodic memories. To enhance applicability of DISCERN as a model of human narrative language production, a larger corpus of stories will be learned that incorporates emotion-coding and self-reference. Simulations will be conducted to determine if disrupted function in different neural modules of DISCERN can produce three core language-based illness manifestations of schizophrenia -- (I) positive thought disorder (such as derailment and illogicality), (II) negative thought disorder (reduced language outputs), and (III) delusions of the idee fixe type. DISCERN will be used to compare and contrast effects of excessive noise versus reduced network connectivity when applied to semantic and working memory modules. Both types of ""lesions"" have been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Noise-induced lesions are predicted to produce word selection errors and curtail language output -- but not to produce positive thought disorder or delusions. In contrast, connectivity loss, when applied to story processing modules, is predicted to simulate all three disturbances, i.e., derailment and curtailment of language outputs as well as production of ""fixed"" narratives that simulate delusions. A parallel, pilot study of normal subjects and patients with schizophrenia will assess narrative recall of episodic memory. These behavioral data will be used to test and refine models of normal and schizophrenic language production. These findings will significantly advance our understanding of illness mechanisms in schizophrenia and direct future research aimed at developing more selective treatments that reverse these abnormalities. n/a",Neural Network Models of Language,6902613,R01MH066228,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'computational neuroscience', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human subject', 'language', 'neural information processing', 'neuropsychology', 'psychopathology', 'schizophrenia', 'short term memory', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,220725,0.04074231413078712

"Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).  Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. What's more, two thirds of children identified as having language-specific impairments previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop language intervention strategies designed specifically to meet the needs of this population; that is, intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions typically missing from the grammar of these children. In Phase I, a curriculum was developed for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. Curriculum design was guided by contemporary linguistic research, which suggests ways in which treatment may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved. Software was developed to deliver parts of this curriculum, and was integrated with an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies. Twenty-six kindergartners used the software successfully during field- testing. In Phase II these efforts will be expanded by developing an integrated series of language intervention modules and verifying that the modules are effective under typical classroom conditions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers and parents recognize the importance of intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal Law.

"Early Language Intervention via the Internet    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test an Internet-based language intervention system designed to promote language development in preschool children with language disorders. Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative. Yet research shows that most children with language delays never receive language intervention services during their preschool years. We propose to complete an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in 3-5 year old children with language function in the range of 24-42 months. The curricular design will be guided by contemporary linguistic research. Online delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks performance and adjusts instructional support. By combining easy access via the Internet with centralized data collection and curricular control, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies, and to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. In Phase I we tested the feasibility and technical merit of this objective. A prototype program module was developed and tested with 23 students who were enrolled in an Early Essential Education program, including 19 preschoolers with language delays.

"Referential Contrast Effects in Language Processing   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A great deal of work in sentence                processing over the years has dealt with the question of whether contextual          information can guide language processing. There is by now considerable              evidence that suggests that some kinds of information from the discourse             context have immediate effects. However, the question of how these effects           occur has remained largely ignored. The studies in this proposal focus on the        discourse properties of modified definite noun phrases. Work in sentence             processing has shown that the resolution of ambiguities in which one of the          possible readings involves noun modification is affected by the availability of      a discourse model in which the modificational phrase serves to distinguish           between two possible referents. A central question is whether such discourse         effects found with modifiers reflect a general, conventionalized property of         modification, or whether they are more aptly characterized as a more subtle          system based on expectations regarding typical usages. A series of studies is        proposed to investigate the hypothesis that a typical default expression exists      for neutral (i.e., non-contrastive) contexts, and that the use of a more             informative expression signals a contrastive function in the discourse, with         immediate processing consequences. Data will come from elicited production           tasks, on-line comprehension experiments which monitor subjects' eye movements       to a visual array in response to spoken linguistic stimuli, traditional reading      time studies, and prosodic analyses in a read-aloud task. The current proposal       represents a significant departure from existing work in two salient ways:           First, it attempts to provide a detailed investigation into the nature of the        referential effects, using a methodology that is especially well-suited for          studying referential aspects of language. Second, whereas previous findings          have been couched almost exclusively in terms of the mechanisms of sentence          processing, the current proposal seeks to integrate experiments from on-line         language processing and language production. Results of this project may be          useful in developing models for language disorders, for the development of           pedagogical tools, and for progress in artificial intelligence.                                                                                                           n/a",Referential Contrast Effects in Language Processing,6615572,R01MH062566,"['clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' eye movements', ' human subject', ' language', ' language development', ' neural information processing', ' phonology', ' reading', ' speech', ' syntax', ' visual stimulus', ' visual tracking']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,114544,0.042506333825438405

As such, we anticipate that our computer-based language intervention system, designed to facilitate language development in school-age children, will be a commercial success and will fulfill an unmet need for individual services. n/a",Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development,6485703,R44DC004107,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' educational resource design /development', ' elementary school', ' human subject', ' language development', ' language disorders', ' middle childhood (6-11)', ' psycholinguistics', ' speech disorders', ' syntax']",NIDCD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2002,597990,0.05787733749341755
"Referential Contrast Effects in Language Processing   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A great deal of work in sentence                processing over the years has dealt with the question of whether contextual          information can guide language processing. There is by now considerable              evidence that suggests that some kinds of information from the discourse             context have immediate effects. However, the question of how these effects           occur has remained largely ignored. The studies in this proposal focus on the        discourse properties of modified definite noun phrases. Work in sentence             processing has shown that the resolution of ambiguities in which one of the          possible readings involves noun modification is affected by the availability of      a discourse model in which the modificational phrase serves to distinguish           between two possible referents. A central question is whether such discourse         effects found with modifiers reflect a general, conventionalized property of         modification, or whether they are more aptly characterized as a more subtle          system based on expectations regarding typical usages. A series of studies is        proposed to investigate the hypothesis that a typical default expression exists      for neutral (i.e., non-contrastive) contexts, and that the use of a more             informative expression signals a contrastive function in the discourse, with         immediate processing consequences. Data will come from elicited production           tasks, on-line comprehension experiments which monitor subjects' eye movements       to a visual array in response to spoken linguistic stimuli, traditional reading      time studies, and prosodic analyses in a read-aloud task. The current proposal       represents a significant departure from existing work in two salient ways:           First, it attempts to provide a detailed investigation into the nature of the        referential effects, using a methodology that is especially well-suited for          studying referential aspects of language. Second, whereas previous findings          have been couched almost exclusively in terms of the mechanisms of sentence          processing, the current proposal seeks to integrate experiments from on-line         language processing and language production.

"Language and Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The aim of the dissertation is to shed light on the question of what linguistic knowledge available to children language learners is innate, as opposed to being gleaned postnatally from the environment, and to do it by answering a more basic question: what, if it were innate, would assist language learning, and what would not? The method involves implementing a formal model for learning a basic but quite versatile kind of grammar for natural language syntax using methods borrowed from statistical machine learning, along with theoretical methods from theories of syntax and semantics in linguistics. Experiments using existing grammars as benchmarks will be carried out computing measures of performance commonly accepted by computational linguists to assess the accuracy of competing grammars. Initially the testing will be done on small fragments of the grammar of English, but with a view to eventual scaling up so that the system can be trained on large sets of data deriving from actual natural language use in conversational contexts. n/a",Language and Learning,6450183,F31HD041927,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' child psychology', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gene environment interaction', ' health science research support', ' language', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological models', ' semantics', ' statistics /biometry', ' syntax']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2002,26141,0.03475655378570562

"EARLY LANGUAGE INTERVENTION VIA THE INTERNET Language delay is pervasive among preschool children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative, yet research shows that most preschoolers do not receive language intervention services. We propose to develop an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in three to five-year-old children with language function in the range of 24 to 42 months. The curricular design will be based on contemporary linguistic research. On-line delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks ongoing performance. By combining Internet accessibility with centralized curricular control and data collection, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies. It will also be possible to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. Our Phase I goal is to test the feasibility and technical merit of our plans. A prototype internet-based language intervention system will be developed and placed on- line in an Early Essential Education classroom, and students with language delays will be given an opportunity to use the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers, and parents recognize the importance of early intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and Federal law mandates such intervention.

"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patientsâacute and chronicâlongitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes.

"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicantâs long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9975626,F31DC018220,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Control Groups', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endowment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'literacy', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'visual tracking', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2020,15602,0.0017135599079838926
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9825536,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,574747,0.06958301845922141
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided âdefinitiveâ evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,9894782,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,517151,0.020435714856868837
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9895715,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,583798,0.06792115387086037
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9850564,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,466715,0.0285022658355911
"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering. Using large existing neuroimaging datasets obtained in these disorders will allow us to address important questions about the causes and consequences of these developmental disorders.",Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders,9944309,F32DC017637,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Stuttering', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'caudate nucleus', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disorder control', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'language impairment', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'standardize measure']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,F32,2020,69426,0.01115702783329023
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication â the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems â semantics, phonology, and sentence planning â are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9944489,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2020,39939,0.07955492707916885
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9875268,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach', 'visual tracking']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,585545,0.06454592743013324
"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimerâs disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimerâs disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

"Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) PROJECT SUMMARY â Original Submission Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Although language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here 24-36 months) impedes accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model to identify PLI as early as possible. Our developmentally- sensitive, translational approach introduces multiple innovations including: (1) characterizing the developmental patterning of toddler emergent language beginning at 24 mos. using state-of-the-art methods, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language into PLI risk assessment; (3) using a novel paradigm to assess the protective effects of both behavioral and neural synchronization within parent-child language transactions; and (4) consideration of irritability, a robust developmental marker of early mental health risk, to enhance identification of those language delayed toddlers at highest risk for persistence. For the proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L), we capitalize on our funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non-irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24-month-olds. Our key predictors will be toddler emergent language patterns (24-36 months), their neural biomarkers and synchrony within the transactional language environment. Our central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age (54 mos., when PLI can be reliably evaluated), assessed via clinical gold standard expressive and receptive language abilities. SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1a. Evaluate accuracy of PLI prediction based on multi-component measures of language including intensive longitudinal assessments of toddler developmental precursors of key language functions at older ages, neural biomarkers. We will assess neural and linguistic processing via quantitative EEG during parent-child interaction and ERPs to speech sounds as well as during eye tracking tasks and 1b. Evaluate feasibility of creating an algorithm for early identification of PLI that can be applied in clinical practice, using cross-validation and machine learning. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that parent-child dyadic synchrony buffers PLI risk For the first time, we combine behavioral and novel social EEG measures of parent-child synchrony during natural interaction and a custom-designed word learning task to directly test how observed (behavioral) and neural (EEG) dyadic synchrony impact word learning. AIM 3: Test whether consideration of toddler irritability enhances PLI prediction. In sum, PLI confers sustained negative effects on a variety of personal-social and academic outcomes. Pinpointing children at highest risk for PLI is critical for reducing the public health burden of PLI for children, families, and the systems supporting them, and enhancing targeted allocation of resources. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, many toddlers with early language delays recover naturally, and others who appear to be developing typically show signs of impairment by preschool age. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, multi-level neurodevelopmental approach to characterize emergent language patterns from 24- 36 mos. along with the influence of neural and linguistic processing and transactional processes within the child's broader language environment. We also test whether PLI prediction is enhanced via consideration of irritability, a robust predictor of early mental health risk. Drawing on findings from our predictive models, we will also examine feasibility of developing a clinical algorithm from this scientifically-validated toolkit. Generating reliable methods for accurate identification of young children at highest risk for language impairment lays the foundation for optimizing early intervention and preventing developmentally-cascading effects on academic and adaptive functioning.",Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L),10162280,R01DC016273,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human Subject Research', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Activity', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Transact', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'standard measure', 'stress reduction', 'translational approach', 'tv watching', 'visual tracking', 'word learning']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,197084,0.039727174318395286
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individualâs independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimerâs disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individualâs quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9890992,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,986375,0.012114338765468908

"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors â a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment. Pinpointing auditory causes of language problems in children with ASDs may inform early interventions.",Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders,9913498,R01DC017736,"['Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anisotropy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Intervention', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Organizational Change', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'critical period', 'density', 'early childhood', 'gray matter', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,592142,-0.0015543725155891188
