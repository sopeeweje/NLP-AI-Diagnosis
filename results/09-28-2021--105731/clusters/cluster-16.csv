"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",9734801,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,422197,0.07848173595225413
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",9758947,F31DA047048,"['4-aminospiroperidol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,35547,0.2616894237887207
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9636556,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2019,168497,0.11613729453576666
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation.

"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9691298,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'translational research program', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,990000,0.3122455354007702
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9824096,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,174994,0.09331880568705465
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results across studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media.",Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight ,9769518,K02DA043657,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Latina', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Media Campaign', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survey Methodology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Twitter', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career development', 'data mining', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'hookah', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'marijuana use', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social implication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2019,118137,0.11007117895936895
"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",9545385,R44DA046151,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'User Compliance', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'active method', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'sobriety', 'software development', 'stress management', 'stress reduction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"CONTINUEYOU, LLC",R44,2019,224991,0.14130415614239794
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting.

We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9756356,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,486320,0.1672704467857252
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9424658,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2018,171483,0.11613729453576666
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project Abstract Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes.

A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9576900,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543369,0.1672704467857252
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results across studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media.",Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight ,9548190,K02DA043657,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Latina', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Media Campaign', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survey Methodology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career development', 'data mining', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'hookah', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'marijuana use', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social implication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2018,118137,0.11007117895936895
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9235662,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2017,173475,0.11613729453576666
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking. This formative research has high public health significance as it can clarify the SNS partner seeking dynamics driving MSM's substance use and sexual risk behaviors to inform culturally congruent technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.",SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior,9303328,R03DA039752,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bisexual', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Gays', 'General Population', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Informed Consent', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Office of AIDS Research', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Sexual Partners', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug testing', 'high risk population', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'oral HIV', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'reduced substance use', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2017,154000,0.17240356818199815
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results across studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media.",Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight ,9285056,K02DA043657,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Latina', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Media Campaign', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survey Methodology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career development', 'data mining', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'hookah', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'marijuana use', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social implication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2017,118137,0.11007117895936895
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking. This formative research has high public health significance as it can clarify the SNS partner seeking dynamics driving MSM's substance use and sexual risk behaviors to inform culturally congruent technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.        ",SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior,9137371,R03DA039752,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bisexual', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Gays', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Informed Consent', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'NIH Office of AIDS Research', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Sexual Partners', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'oral HIV', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'reduced substance use', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,154000,0.17240356818199815
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.        ",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9052904,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2015,128696,0.3122455354007702
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving  Project Summary Abstract This proposal aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effets of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this proposal will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.

Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders.

"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY  Individuals with substance use disorders are disproportionately experiencing homelessness, poverty, and chronic medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension), which are emerging risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (official name for the virus that causes COVID-19). Different types of substance use have been associated with development of respiratory infections and progression to severe respiratory failure, also known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, complex syndromes like ARDS and behavioral conditions like substance misuse are difficult to identify from the electronic health record. Clinical notes and radiology reports provide a rich source of information that may be used to identify cases of substance misuse and ARDS. This information is routinely recorded during hospital care, and automated, data-driven solutions with natural language processing (NLP) can extract semantics and important risk factors from the unstructured data of clinical notes. The computational methods of NLP derive meaning from clinical notes, from which machine learning can predict risk factors for patients leaving AMA or progressing to respiratory failure. Our team developed tools with >80% sensitivity/specificity to identify individual types of substance misuse using NLP with machine learning (ML). Our single-center models delineated risk factors embedded in the notes (e.g., mental health conditions, socioeconomic indicators). Further, we have developed and externally validated a machine learning tool to identify cases of ARDS with high accuracy for early treatment. We aim to expand this work by pooling data across health systems and build a generalizable and comprehensive classifier that captures multiple types of substance misuse for use in risk stratification and prognostication during the COVID pandemic.  We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal analysis of hospitalized patients, and that such information can be used to identify those at risk for disrupted care and those at risk for respiratory failure. We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 60,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. This Administrative Supplement will allow us to examine the correlations between substances of misuse and risk for COVID-19 as well as development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the context of these phenomena.

"A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources Project Summary Access to community resources such as housing, food, transportation and medication also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) has been shown to be critical for a successful treatment and recovery of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, case managers and social workers at various points-of-care (e.g. law enforcement sobering centers, primary health centers) dedicate time to identify community resources that may address their patients’ health and social barriers. However, identifying competent community resources remains a challenge as they are usually stored in manual “referral binders” which are highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations. Therefore, this significantly contributes to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD. Based on preliminary data and interviews with case managers and social workers, this SBIR Phase I study has two objectives. 1) Evaluate whether a co-creation led business model that will leverage partnerships with organizations that have SUD subject matter expertise (e.g. Houston Recovery Center - https://houstonrecoverycenter.org/) can provide enhanced access to SUD treatment services and community resources at the point-of-care. This is important as most points-of-care particularly primary health centers may not have care teams highly experienced in curating SUD related resources. Therefore, our innovation will facilitate the flow of SUD related community resources from organizations with SUD subject matter expertise to those without, such as primary health centers. 2) Establish the feasibility of a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm in matching health and social needs identified at the point-of-care to relevant and competent community resources. Our hypothesis is that the co-creation led business model coupled with a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm will lead to enhanced access to appropriate SUD recovery and healthcare resources. Finally, upon successful completion of Phase I, a future Phase II project will focus on establishing whether these innovations have a positive impact on the utilization of SUD recovery support services, encounters with law enforcement and EMS services.

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10017030,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,191907,0.07848173595225413
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",10001326,F31DA047048,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support vector machine']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2020,36051,0.2616894237887207
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9851871,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2020,165510,0.11613729453576666
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9980343,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,118134,0.09331880568705465
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years.

These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10161464,UG1DA040309,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Community Networks', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Fire - disasters', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Maine', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'National Clinical Trials Network', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New Hampshire', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vermont', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cocaine use', 'college', 'community organizations', 'comorbidity', 'data privacy', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk population', 'high school', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana use', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'personalized health care', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'research study', 'rural setting', 'scale up', 'screening', 'smart watch', 'social media', 'special interest group', 'telehealth', 'treatment disparity', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,UG1,2020,622500,0.053772071285810595
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9942350,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2020,738169,0.08317536179401326
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9923614,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical trial analysis', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100287,0.1672704467857252
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results across studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media.",Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight ,10002211,K02DA043657,"['ATOD', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Latina', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Media Campaign', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survey Methodology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Twitter', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career development', 'data mining', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'hookah', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social factors', 'social implication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2020,118137,0.11007117895936895
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",9981957,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,1020000,0.2101489067286332
