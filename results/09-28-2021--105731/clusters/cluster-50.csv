"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,9846761,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2019,68862,0.019020852823584768
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. In some cases, the computational models are derived from discrete molecular endpoints while in others they are quite broad in scope. Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade both in model development and availability such that the next generation of larger scale models will promote it to the next level and further focus in vitro and in vivo testing on verification of select predictions. Pharmaceutical, consumer products and other chemistry focused companies possess structure-activity data generated over many decades of screening that is not in the public domain, and this data is primarily only accessible to the cheminformatics experts in each company. Outside of these companies small biotechs and academics must rely on data from public databases, commercial databases and their own data. Integrating such data and processing it to build algorithms that can help with predictive models is a vast undertaking. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity related and drug discovery endpoints. Drug companies tend to focus on target related information whereas there might be an opportunity to understand toxicity also. Our work with a consumer product company indicated the need for accessing machine learning models based on the growing public datasets could be a commercially viable product. Without massive legacy internal data many of small drug discovery and consumer product companies will have to make do with data accessible in PubChem, ChEMBL or other public databases (ToxCast, Tox21 etc) only. In this proposal we will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms (Bayesian, Support vector machines, random forest and Deep Neural Networks as just some examples) for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo datasets. We are not aware of any other company pursuing such an approach to create as wide an array of toxicity models. We are also not aware of other software companies in the toxicity model space generating their own experimental data to test the models. Such a technology could have very broad utility for other pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, consumer product companies, regulatory groups and academic research groups. As we have been working for several years to build up technologies and experience in cheminformatics and software development it would be relatively straightforward for us to build the core foundations of MegaTox and deliver them to potential customers. This technology will also be used in our consulting projects with pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. Project Narrative The objective of ‘MegaTox’ is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating toxicity data, and machine learning models. This will enable the prediction of various toxicity endpoints relevant to pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. We will use the latest machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated public datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system. We will use MegaTox internally for our own drug discovery projects as well as leverage it for consulting for clients so we can combine public and private datasets and increase the coverage of chemical property space.

"MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models Summary Being able to predict interactions with important human transporters would be of value to new drug design to avoid compounds that interact with them and cause undesirable side effects. OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) are `uptake' transporters largely restricted to the sinusoidal aspect of hepatocytes. They both transport a wide variety of structurally-unrelated compounds, including members of several clinically im- portant drug families such as statins, sartans and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We now propose to test over 1000 drugs against 2 substrates for each transporter in vitro. We will then use these data to curate and validate machine learning models. We will also use an array of machine learning methods as well as multiple model evaluation metrics. This will enable us to develop a web-based software tool called MegaTrans that will encourage the user to input their own compound structures and generate predictions for interactions with transporter/s of interest and then visualize the similarity to the training set of each model using several different visualization methods. The return on investment of such a tool would be that it could assist in the design and selection of more favorable compounds that avoid transporters of interest while also saving time and money. It could also identify compounds that are already approved that might present a drug interaction risk. Predicting such behavior seen in vivo is ideal and will lead to the prioritization of compounds to test in vitro for potential drug-drug interactions. In Phase II we would greatly expand the number of transporters which we would generate data on and build models such that we could address all the major transporters of interest to drug discovery. Narrative The objective of “MegaTrans” is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating human trans- porter data into drug discovery pipelines, as well as enabling its analysis and visualization. This will then enable improved computational tool development for in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of xenobiotic exposures across a range of assay types. It will also assist with developing computational tools for quantitatively modeling drug-drug interactions of xenobiotics. Across Phase I and Phase II we will generate data for transporters which currently have a paucity of data in the public domain, use validated machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system to enable predictions.",MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models,9768844,R41GM131433,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Modelings', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescein', 'Glucuronides', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Products', 'Online Systems', 'Organic Cation Transporter', 'Output', 'POU2F2 gene', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'side effect', 'software development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'uptake']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2019,210712,-0.013749474916398816
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9834239,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,0.011445848801961221
"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools. We anticipate that this work will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis,9886611,R01GM132391,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Circulation', 'Case Study', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Intestines', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nutritional', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subject Headings', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'chemical standard', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'gastrointestinal system', 'gut microbiota', 'interest', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'neural network', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'open source', 'physical property', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2019,379614,0.058971968526484043
"Feature Learning For Improved Multiplex Disease Diagnosis Abstract This proposal is for CATTS, a feature learning technique optimized for use in multiplex mass spectrometry (MS) fingerprinting assays.

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies.

This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9608754,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,356625,0.05647550358643737
"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,9786702,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,431816,0.043122512689478025
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary We have recently used computational models to identify the protease inhibitor indinavir (used as an antiviral for HIV) as a positive allosteric modulator at the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We now propose to build on this discovery as well as other publications describing compounds that are positive allosteric modulators of the α7- nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We propose identifying further compounds that possess activity against this or one of 9 other targets implicated in Alzheimer’s disease using a combination of Bayesian machine learning and in vitro assays. Generating such data will enable us to potentially provide more specific compounds as well as building datasets that can be used to build predictive models to identify additional compounds with activity at these Alzheimer’s targets. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the Alzheimer’s disease scientific community. We are proposing to build and validate models based on public databases, select compounds for testing and use the data generated as a starting point for further optimization. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that causes dementia and it is characterized by amyloid deposition of a 39-42 AA peptide (Aβ) processed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Many palliative drugs are available for the disease but there is still an urgent need for curative drugs with greater efficacy. We need to understand the key factors involved in disease progression and their suitability as drug targets for discovering new drugs against Alzheimer's disease. We hence propose to study several of these targets for Alzheimer’s disease involving all the key steps in the pathway, including several old and new targets. We will use our ‘Assay Central’ software to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, that can be used to selected compounds to test activity in vitro as a starting point for further optimization.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9881110,R44GM122196,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'HIV', 'Indinavir', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Publications', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'alpha-bungarotoxin receptor', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro activity', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'positive allosteric modulator', 'predictive modeling']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2019,188759,-0.03173424281337319

"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9640405,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,1140875,0.039537078569626065
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9807074,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2019,482291,0.017252462713473846
"High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform Project Summary/Abstract The scale of the US opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the critical need for breakthroughs to assess compound abuse liabilities and to enable discovery of new analgesics with minimal abuse potential. We hypothesize that altered addiction-associated physiology can be modeled in co-cultured hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells and detected by profiling gene expression alterations and associated phenotypic readouts. Our proposal addresses the significant lack of physiologically-relevant tools capable of profiling relevant molecular changes that underpin addiction in the human nervous system by executing Specific Aims that encompass: (1) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; (2) execution of a phenotype-based pilot machine learning-enabled predictive abuse liability screen; and (3) combination of phenotypic profiling and gene expression analysis to characterize the molecular and cellular changes associated with compound exposure. Successful completion of our project will deliver 2 significant advances: (1) an important new technical framework to assess abuse potential of candidate therapeutics early in the development process and (2) an innovative, scalable in vitro assay platform that enables discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to mitigate addiction phenotypes. These innovations will position Cairn Biosciences to initiate drug discovery programs that will bring significant societal benefit by helping to stem the growth of the US opioid crisis and reduce the mortality rates and economic burden associated with this National Emergency. Project Narrative The ongoing opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the need for new approaches to overcome addiction and mitigate the abuse liabilities of new therapies, yet a critical barrier to progress is the lack of in vitro assays in human cells to profile the abuse liabilities of therapeutics. Our project will deliver an innovative in vitro assay platform that enables 1) the assessment of abuse liability of candidate therapeutics early in development and 2) the discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to prevent development of an addiction phenotype. These high impact advances align with government priorities such as the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) initiative and will deliver significant additional benefit to public health by enabling identification of safer new therapeutics without addictive potential.",High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform,9912598,R44DA048686,"['Address', 'Analgesics', 'Astrocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Glutamates', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Array', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transfection', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'addiction', 'base', 'design', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug discovery', 'expression vector', 'healing', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'stem', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIDA,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,323750,-0.028067259218655237

"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9826639,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2019,54833,0.010422014661278437
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9613245,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,352125,0.02846976991172935
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures.

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9462161,R01GM114029,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,338393,0.07290384632334863
"Quantifying NETosis via Automated High Content Imaging Convolutional Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY NETosis was identified as a distinct mode of cell death in neutrophils more than a decade ago. Dysregulation of NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of human pathologies such as preeclampsia, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and coagulopathies that include cancer-associated thrombosis. The literature consistently cites the lack of a standardized methodology for quantitation of NETosis as an impediment to basic and translational research. Thus, the premise is that there is a compelling, unmet need for a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis to accelerate neutrophil and inflammation-based research and facilitate the discovery and development of therapeutic compounds. The scope of this STTR project is to develop a high-throughput image analysis and quantitation method by using high content imaging and the revolutionary technology of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the identification and quantitation of NETosis in human neutrophils. The target readout is based on the primary morphological difference between NETotic and non-NETotic nuclei--the decondensation of chromatin. This image-based quantitative method will be observer-independent and will enable robust and rapid evaluation of a large number of samples that would exceed any attempts at manual assessment. In Phase I we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize and standardize the high- throughput platform for quantitation of NETosis in adherent human neutrophils. This includes standard assay optimization procedures, training the CNN to identify and quantitate NETotic neutrophil, and demonstrating that the CNN reliably distinguishes between necrosis and NETosis, whose phenotypes appear similar to the human eye. Aim 2: Validate the NETosis assay biochemically and clinically. This includes concentration-response assays with NETosis agonists, assessment of NETosis inhibitors, and evaluation of the NETotic status of Sickle Cell Disease patient samples (a disease in which aberrant NETosis has been implicated). The expected outcome of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for this automated high- throughput NETosis assay. Further, we expect to provide insight into the utility of the assay for assessment of inhibitors of NETosis as therapeutic agents. Upon completion of our Phase I aims, our Phase II program will focus on further optimizing and validating this NETosis assay and preparing it for commercialization.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lack of a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis is impeding basic and translational research. We have developed a high-throughput assay using convolutional neural networks to quantify NETosis in human neutrophils.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9406318,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,356625,0.05647550358643737
"Rules for penetrating the Gram-negative bacterial envelope The development of new antimicrobials has drastically lagged behind the fast growth of drug resistant pathogenic microbes, especially for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria. To be effective in GN bacteria, entering and staying in the cells is a challenge. Insight into the physicochemical properties that enable the entrance of compounds is critical to direct future effort in the development of effective treatment against GN pathogens. Toward this goal, we will develop methods to accurately quantify the accumulation of small molecule compounds, without requiring fluorescence or other properties for detection, and independent of their antibacterial activity. In addition, we will develop a novel computational algorithm to describe and predict physicochemical properties that favors entry and evade efflux in GN bacteria. The computer model will be validated and refined through the selection and characterization of ~1,500 of compounds. Specifically, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1) To develop and validate LC-MS/MS based assays to quantify compound partition. We will use a panel of antibiotics as ""gold standards"" to develop and validate assays to accurately determine the accumulation of small molecule compounds in different cellular compartments. We will develop LC-MS/MS assays and experiment with the kinetics of entrance, optimizing the conditions to enable reproducible and accurate quantification. We will use a CRE strain of E. coli and a MDR strain of Acinetobacter baumannii in this study. Aim 2) To develop a computational algorithm for predicting compounds that are potentially good penetrators for GN bacteria. We will develop a new and highly accurate computational algorithm through machine learning which can systematically recognize all favorable structural factors of the compounds effective for GN bacteria. Selected compounds will be experimentally characterized in Aim 3, the knowledge from which will be incorporated back into refining the computational algorithm to generate a new round of learning/prediction. This cycle will be repeated, with the testing of ~1,500 compounds in total. Aim 3) To measure the accumulation and subcellular distribution of selected compounds and to validate rules on compound accumulation. With the assays from Aim 1, we will measure the accumulation data of compounds selected through Aim 2. Data from these analyses will be used to polish the computer model in Aim 2. Finally, the models will be evaluated through measurement of accumulation data of selected compounds and examine if the experimental data match the prediction. The knowledge gap about penetrating the cellular envelope has become the biggest hurdle to the rational design of new classes of antimicrobials against all GN pathogens. Outcome from the proposed study will help bridge the gap between a potent inhibitor and an effective antibacterial drug. The combined use of the detailed experimental assays and the new computational algorithm will empower drug discovery efforts that aim to identify promising drug candidates targeting GN bacteria.

"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,9589711,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,439996,0.043122512689478025
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays.

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9547382,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'human microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'stool sample', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634157,0.02746692740122627
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

"Feature Learning For Improved Multiplex Disease Diagnosis Abstract This proposal is for CATTS, a feature learning technique optimized for use in multiplex mass spectrometry (MS) fingerprinting assays. MS fingerprints consist of a large number of chemical species, leading to very high dimensional feature spaces, and subsequent high false-discovery rates. CATTS aims to reduce the size of this space, by using knowledge of the underlying biochemistry, as well as general-purpose clustering algorithms. Our preliminary results demonstrate that, when used as a feature-learning technique for a variety of classification methods, CATTS significantly improves assay sensitivity. This proposal takes our existing implementation of CATTS and extends it to support additional feature learning algorithms and classification methods. Additionally, its performance as a multiplex assay strategy will be tested on both protein and lipid MS fingerprint libraries, with an eye towards commercialization.. Relevance to public health: The detection of pathogens via mass spectroscopy fingerprinting is rapidly becoming a standard technique for clinical microbiology. However, high false detection rates and conflicting multiple identifications limit applicability, and make interpretation of results difficult. Our work on CATTS aims to improve the statistical performance of these assays. Preliminary results from studies on one dataset we intend to apply CATTS to suggest that UTIs and, in some cases antimicrobial resistance, can be detected, directly from patient samples. However, the statistical methods currently employed aren't reliable enough - the further development of CATTS will accelerate the development of this, and other mass-spectroscopy-based assays..",Feature Learning For Improved Multiplex Disease Diagnosis,9559527,R43GM128538,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Biochemistry', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Eye', 'Fingerprint', 'Immune', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Fingerprints', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'vector']",NIGMS,"DEURION, LLC",R43,2018,189594,0.013491713116873047
"The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay: a high throughput platform to screen compounds for neurodevelopmental effects Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disabilities, Bipolar disorders, and Schizophrenia, etc.) are prevalent and due to errors in neurodifferentiation and neurocircuitry. While NDDs, in many cases, are due to inherited mutations, evidence is mounting that prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants also cause NDDs via disruption of epigenetics (e.g., modifications of histones [histone tags] or methylation of DNA). Our project will develop the Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay, which will enable testing of chemicals for epigenetic effects related to NDDs. In preliminary research by Alexey Terskikh (Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute) MIEL methods were developed in which human Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs, from fetal brain) were treated with test compounds and analyzed for changes in the pattern of histone tags within the nuclei (altered “epigenetic signature” – which utilizes multiplexed immunolabeling, automated high throughput imaging, and cell-by-cell analysis using machine learning). A subset of chemicals from the US EPA ToxCast program was analyzed, and “epigenetic hits” were identified. In a separate approach, Vala Sciences Inc, which commercializes cell-based assays relevant to toxicology/drug discovery, tested EPA compounds on synapses/neurite formation in neurons developed from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-neurons), which represent human neurons in early stages of maturation. When results from the assays were compared, several epigenetic hits also altered synapse and neurite formation in the iPSC-neurons consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic alterations may alter fate decisions of NPCs and neurodevelopment. To further develop the MIEL-ND, we propose to screen additional ToxCast compounds for effects on epigenetic and cell fate NPCs and test the compounds for effects on synapse/neurites in iPSC-neurons to develop a library of epigenetic hits with known effects on the two cell types. We will use these data and emerging data from the ToxCast program, to develop and optimize the MIEL-ND to predict NDD-inducing effects of possible environmental toxicants. The MIEL- ND will identify compounds that affect neurodevelopment that are not cytotoxic (which are missed by current assays) and represents a less expensive, higher throughput, more predictive alternative to current tests which use animals, thus reducing the use of animals in toxicity testing. Phase II goals include developing a version of the MIEL-ND featuring iPSC-NPCs (enabling use of cells derived from patients with NDDs), and adaptation of the assay to identify potential therapeutics for NDDs. Our proposed project will develop an assay to enable us to test environmental pollutants for their potential to cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Autism, Intellectual Disability [retardation], Bipolar Disease [Manic Depression], and Schizophrenia. While many cases of NDDs are due to inherited mutations (the disease “runs in the family”), recent research indicates that exposure of the mother to pollution during pregnancy can cause NDDs in children that would otherwise be healthy. This is because development of the fetal brain is very sensitive to toxins. In our assay, cells representing early stages of brain development will be cultured in the laboratory and treated with compounds from the US EPA that are linked to NDDs. The cells will be photographed with robotic microscopes and the images analyzed with computers to determine which compounds may alter neurodevelopment. Currently, testing for effects on brain development of the fetus is done with animal testing. Our assay will be cheaper, more rapid, and more predictive than animal models (since it will use human cells); our assay will reduce the use of animals in toxicity research, which is a big problem, as hundreds of new compounds are developed, each year, for use in agriculture and manufacturing, and help reduce the number of people afflicted with NDDs.",The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay: a high throughput platform to screen compounds for neurodevelopmental effects,9623072,R41MH119621,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Viability', 'Fetus', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Pregnancy', 'Research', 'Research Contracts', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'epigenome', 'fetal', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'microscopic imaging', 'nerve stem cell', 'neural precursor cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuron development', 'prediction algorithm', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'senescence', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIMH,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R41,2018,300000,0.02293320112901994
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9593457,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,276802,0.037256926690533244
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9611819,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'emergency service responder', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149471,0.010422014661278437
"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s.

"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9465735,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2018,178854,0.017252462713473846
"Sterol and Isoprenoid Diseases Consortium Supplement 2018 Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare inherited neurocutaneous disease characterized by ichthyosis, spastic diplegia or tetraplegia, intellectual disability, and a distinctive retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in ALDH3A2, which codes for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. Despite knowing the gene defect and enzyme abnormality, the pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear and no single biomarker exists that correlates with disease severity. FALDH deficiency results in several lipid abnormalities including accumulation of fatty aldehydes, which have potential toxic effects via formation of covalent adducts with proteins and lipids. This unusual lipid abnormality has the potential to affect multiple unrelated cellular pathways that are critical for disease pathogenesis. Our recent metabolomic studies in SLS have identified a unique biochemical profile of at least 30 metabolites in plasma that suggests disruption of several previously unsuspected pathways. We now propose to mine our STAIR 7004 clinical database of 20 SLS patients together with their associated metabolomic data to develop a minimal “metabolomic profile” that will correlate with severity of clinical symptoms and function as a reliable biomarker. These studies will utilize various statistical analytical methods, including principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and random forest analysis, to define a minimal group of clinically informative metabolites, representing multiple biochemical pathways, for construction of a SLS metabolomic profile. When completed, this research will provide an objective biomarker for SLS disease description and therapeutic monitoring. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, spasticity, intellectual disability and a distinct retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in a gene called ALDH3A2 and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. The pathogenic mechanisms that are responsible for the symptoms are still not defined. The proposed research will investigate whether a distinctly abnormal group of biochemicals in the blood, which constitute a “metabolomics profile”, will correlate with the severity of symptoms in patients and thereby act as an objective biomarker for disease severity.",Sterol and Isoprenoid Diseases Consortium Supplement 2018,9719054,U54HD061939,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Congenital ichthyosis', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty Acids', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Lipids', 'Little&apos', 's Disease', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Neurocutaneous Syndromes', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Specimen', 'Sterols', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'adduct', 'analytical method', 'biomarker identification', 'fatty aldehyde', 'forest', 'isoprenoid', 'lipid metabolism', 'long-chain-aldehyde dehydrogenase', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'response', 'spasticity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2018,58479,-0.006028562072558273
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9485464,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,1436141,0.039537078569626065

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9250169,R01GM114029,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,339051,0.07290384632334863
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9260548,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,356625,0.05647550358643737
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9353372,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,650808,0.02746692740122627

"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9357736,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filoviridae', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Products', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'clinical candidate', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2017,312390,0.029576548446741478
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,0.02846976991172935
"Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics Project Summary  Metabolites are building blocks of cellular function, thus understanding the mechanisms that underlie various physiological conditions and processes will provide insight into disease or aberrant states. Innovative developments in high-throughput analytical technologies and data analysis have allowed for systems-level metabolomics analyses to be performed, many of these technologies have centered around mass spectrometry. The diverse chemical structures in the human metabolome exhibit a wide range of concentration, solubility, polarity and volatility with highly diverse structural forms and physiochemical properties as well as a high number of isomers, therefore the need for as many orthogonal separations as possible is necessary for metabolomics experiments (i.e., multidimensional data sets). Mass spectrometry approaches incorporating liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/MS) analyses have shown utility for global untargeted metabolic profiling experiments. Since ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a relatively new commercially available technology, the incorporation of the ion mobility measurement (via collision cross section, CCS) into current metabolomics data analysis identification strategies is minimal. The typical analytical use of ion mobility is as a quick chemical separation (which allows for noise reduction, increase in peak capacity, etc.), however IM can also be used to increase the confidence in identification and characterization because CCS provides structure specific information about individual metabolites. The long term objectives of this proposal are all centered around incorporating IM measurements into metabolomics based chemoinformatic and bioinformatics pipelines. These include: (1) determining the extent at which the ion mobility dimension can address molecular specificity of isomeric metabolites, (2) developing an IM-based library using CCS values as a descriptor to screen and assign identities to unknown metabolites and lastly, (3) incorporating visualization tools for navigating multidimensional datasets which will allow scientists to better uncover relationships between metabolites and human health. Molecular specificity of the IM dimension will be addressed by analyzing previously generated IM-MS data from a commercially available metabolite library (>600 primary metabolites, of which >20% are isomeric). Individual metabolites in the metabolite library will also be interrogated for curation of the CCS library and these values will be used in the molecular identification pipeline for global untargeted metabolite studies generated previously. Lastly, multidimensional self-organizing maps will be utilized to visualize and navigate various dimensions of data (LC, CCS, m/z, etc.) and ultimately allow the user to prioritize and identify with high confidence metabolites indicative of disease state. Accomplishing the aims outlined in this proposal will be seen as overcoming several critical barriers which have so far hindered the routine and widespread use of ion mobility in MS-based metabolomics workflows. Project Narrative  The innovative developments described in the proposal incorporate high-throughput metabolomics technologies, big data informatics, and multidimensional visualization strategies which will allow scientists to uncover relationships between metabolites and human health using systems-level metabolomics analyses. Specifically, we believe these goals can be accomplished by overcoming several critical barriers to adopting new technologies based on multidimensional mass spectrometry which hold promise for furthering our knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems. Strategies outlined in this proposal include, providing a highly annotated library incorporating empirical ion mobility based collision cross section values (inclusive also of exact mass, fragment ion data, and retention time) and developing novel big data and visualization strategies to improve throughput and confidence in metabolite annotations.",Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics,9433378,R03CA222452,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exhibits', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phonation', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Solubility', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'ion mobility', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'professor', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,151533,0.049623624481693246
"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9347295,R44HL127843,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Preservation', 'Blood', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Europe', 'Formulation', 'Glutathione', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospital Costs', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'State Hospitals', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'model design', 'novel', 'open innovation', 'oxidative damage', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'wasting']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,1099022,0.01723405036331149
"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kynurenine catabolic pathway for tryptophan degradation in humans produces metabolites that are neurologically active and affect neurotransmission and neuronal integrity. Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a product of the pathway which has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and has been correlated with depression in patients administered the inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-α. Besides, activation of the kynurenine pathway by inflammation leads to elevated levels of QUIN, which have been shown to cause depressive-like behavior in mice. The mechanism by which QUIN acts in the brain is to activate excitotoxic neurotransmitter pathways involving the amino acid glutamate and by leading to lipid peroxidation. Following metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and subsequent steps, three consecutive enzymes of the kynurenine pathway determine the metabolic partitioning of tryptophan metabolites to QUIN, picolinic acid (PIC), or further metabolism. We hypothesize that the shift of QUIN and PIC levels is linked to chronic inflammation and major depression. To test this hypothesis, we will, in the first aim, study the structure and action of the enzymes and the mechanisms controlling QUIN and PIC production. In the second aim, a new, rapid and efficient analytical method will be developed for in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of QUIN and PIC levels and will be applied to samples obtained from patient populations expected to exhibit high levels of QUIN as a result of increased inflammation and from assays using purified protein to simulate similar distributions. Through these studies, the correlation between kynurenine metabolites and major depression will be investigated, and small molecule inhibitors will be used as probes for modulating the production of QUIN and PIC levels. n/a",Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study,9272010,R21MH107985,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Carboxy-Lyases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Epilepsy', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Kynurenic Acid', 'Kynurenine', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picolinic Acids', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quinolinic Acid', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan 2,3 Dioxygenase', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'enzyme pathway', 'excitotoxicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'patient population', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2017,222688,0.010439513606197782
"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.            ",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9104589,R01GM114029,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'research study', 'response', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,359776,0.07290384632334863
"A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites covering a substantial fraction of the small molecules present in a biological sample. This presents an exciting opportunity to develop potentially transformative approaches to study cells and organisms. One major challenge in realizing this potential lies in processing and analyzing the data. A typical dataset from an untargeted experiment contains many of thousands of “features,” each of which could correspond to a unique metabolite. Analyzing such datasets to obtain meaningful biological information depends on reliably and efficiently resolving the chemical identities of the detected features. Currently, in silico fragmentation methods predict candidate metabolites that are scored and ranked based on how well the fragmentation explains the observed MS/MS spectrum, and on other factors influencing fragmentation such as bond dissociation energies and ionization conditions. Deciding which candidate metabolites is the best match for a particular feature in the context of the biological sample, however, is a daunting task. Extensive testing of candidate metabolites against chemical standards library may be prohibitive in terms of cost and efforts. We seek to develop software-enabled workflows centered on resolving metabolite identities. Our approach is to exploit knowledge of the biological context of a sample to identify the metabolites. Recognizing that the metabolites present in a sample result from enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions active in the corresponding biological system, we employ topological analysis and inference to best map the metabolites implied by the detected features to metabolic pathways that are feasible based on the genome(s) of cells in the biological system. Aim 1 develops a computational method based on Bayesian-inference to enhance candidate metabolite rankings that are obtained via in silico fragmentation analysis. Our method utilizes all available information (database lookups, in silico fragmentation analysis, and network/pathway context) to maximally inform and adjust the rankings. Aim 2 will build software widgets to implement the metabolite identification workflow within a data-analytics framework. As the analytics framework, we will use Orange, which allows the user to create interactive data analysis pipelines through a plug-and-play graphical user interface (GUI). Aim 3 will validate the computational method and software widget implementation. Experimental validation will utilize high-purity standards to confirm (or reject) the computationally assigned metabolite identities. Widget implementation will be evaluated through a focus group discussion with the widget users in the labs directed by the PIs. As project outcomes, we anticipate both a methodological advance in analyzing mass signature data as well as a suite of easily accessible software in the form of widgets. Metabolomics is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites. Prospectively, advanced computational tools and software for metabolomics data analysis can aid discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel bioactive metabolites that could be developed into diagnostic indicators or therapeutic agents. ",A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities,9223450,R03CA211839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical standard', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'database query', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'ionization', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'software development']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2016,147569,0.037518000362470084
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9136115,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,662793,0.02746692740122627
"Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like liver X receptor (LXR) β selective agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent work demonstrated that activation of the LXR signaling pathways leads to improved amyloid β (Aβ) turnover, reduction in Aβ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic LXRβ selective binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects such as mutagenicity or binding to undesired targets. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biological assays to assess toxicity, brain penetration potential and the ability to induce expression of the corresponding genes. A dozen diverse compounds will have been tested through two iterations of the two steps of in silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. These initial leads will be augmented with additional de novo compounds and further scrutinized via behavioral assays, dose-response studies and more detailed, sophisticated, and mechanistic assays during Phase 2. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biological assays will identify drug-like LXRβ selective agonists with minimal side-effects. These agonists will slow and reverse Alzheimer’s Disease.",Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining,9202941,R43AG054350,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Joints', 'LXRalpha protein', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Liver X Receptor', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'PPAR gamma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'lipid metabolism', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacophore', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'social']",NIA,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2016,223325,-0.015570651584275709
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9204673,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Product Drug', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'bioactive natural products', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2016,288801,0.029576548446741478
"Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year, while infecting nearly 9 million. New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best 6 months in duration. We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials. (E)-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)-N2,N4-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2019) [1], was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in 2013. It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in 1969 [2]. While JSF-2019 did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands, a close analog, ((E)-N2,N4-diisopropyl-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2032) [2] was reported in 1969 to exhibit in vivo activity. Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS, mouse liver microsomal stability, Caco-2 cell permeability, and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic. We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy, in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these early compounds. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents. Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant/whole-genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class. Phase I would, therefore, seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target/s through complimentary methods. A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and/or biotech/pharmaceutical companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic, which claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year. Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models. We will also probe the potential target/s of the triazine series.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P.

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kynurenine catabolic pathway for tryptophan degradation in humans produces metabolites that are neurologically active and affect neurotransmission and neuronal integrity. Quinolinic acid (QUIN) is a product of the pathway which has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and has been correlated with depression in patients administered the inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-α. Besides, activation of the kynurenine pathway by inflammation leads to elevated levels of QUIN, which have been shown to cause depressive-like behavior in mice. The mechanism by which QUIN acts in the brain is to activate excitotoxic neurotransmitter pathways involving the amino acid glutamate and by leading to lipid peroxidation. Following metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and subsequent steps, three consecutive enzymes of the kynurenine pathway determine the metabolic partitioning of tryptophan metabolites to QUIN, picolinic acid (PIC), or further metabolism. We hypothesize that the shift of QUIN and PIC levels is linked to chronic inflammation and major depression. To test this hypothesis, we will, in the first aim, study the structure and action of the enzymes and the mechanisms controlling QUIN and PIC production. In the second aim, a new, rapid and efficient analytical method will be developed for in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of QUIN and PIC levels and will be applied to samples obtained from patient populations expected to exhibit high levels of QUIN as a result of increased inflammation and from assays using purified protein to simulate similar distributions. Through these studies, the correlation between kynurenine metabolites and major depression will be investigated, and small molecule inhibitors will be used as probes for modulating the production of QUIN and PIC levels.         n/a",Kynurenine metabolites and depression: An in vitro and ex vivo study,9112097,R21MH107985,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Carboxy-Lyases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Enzymes', 'Epilepsy', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Kynurenic Acid', 'Kynurenine', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picolinic Acids', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quinolinic Acid', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan 2,3 Dioxygenase', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'enzyme pathway', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'patient population', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2016,197688,0.010439513606197782
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,0.03947261564831615
"High Content Sceening for Hereditary Stroke Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a hereditary stroke syndrome that has no treatment other than neurosurgery. Loss of one of three genes causes CCM. By reducing the expression of one of these genes (CCM2) in the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells), unique structural and functional phenotypes result. We will use a chemical suppression screen in cell culture systems to discover small molecules that rescue these distinct phenotypes. Our high-throughput platform consists of two primary screens: the first is an imaging screen with machine-learning based phenotype analysis; the second screen uses electric cell substrate impedance sensing to detect changes in endothelial barrier function. We will then further screen the top candidate compounds in a mouse model of human CCM disease. The result of this project will be personalized medicine candidates for the treatment of CCM caused by mutations in the CCM2 gene.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8928177,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,673919,0.02746692740122627

In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology. Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8874981,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,377291,0.06916067082523021
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,0.03947261564831615
"High Content Sceening for Hereditary Stroke Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a hereditary stroke syndrome that has no treatment other than neurosurgery. Loss of one of three genes causes CCM. By reducing the expression of one of these genes (CCM2) in the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells), unique structural and functional phenotypes result. We will use a chemical suppression screen in cell culture systems to discover small molecules that rescue these distinct phenotypes. Our high-throughput platform consists of two primary screens: the first is an imaging screen with machine-learning based phenotype analysis; the second screen uses electric cell substrate impedance sensing to detect changes in endothelial barrier function. We will then further screen the top candidate compounds in a mouse model of human CCM disease. The result of this project will be personalized medicine candidates for the treatment of CCM caused by mutations in the CCM2 gene.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.            ",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8817197,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,727558,0.02746692740122627
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8841436,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2014,402924,0.013840271651911474
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,0.06916067082523021
"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"High Content Sceening for Hereditary Stroke Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a hereditary stroke syndrome that has no treatment other than neurosurgery. Loss of one of three genes causes CCM. By reducing the expression of one of these genes (CCM2) in the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells), unique structural and functional phenotypes result. We will use a chemical suppression screen in cell culture systems to discover small molecules that rescue these distinct phenotypes. Our high-throughput platform consists of two primary screens: the first is an imaging screen with machine-learning based phenotype analysis; the second screen uses electric cell substrate impedance sensing to detect changes in endothelial barrier function. We will then further screen the top candidate compounds in a mouse model of human CCM disease.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.          The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.

"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8484404,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,370345,0.06916067082523021
"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Discovery of A-beta Oligomer Antagonists via 3D Pharmacophore Space Analysis The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research strategy is to target ApoE gene expression through RXR agonists; this has recently been shown to improve A¿ turnover, reduction in A¿ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic RXR binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biochemical assays including competitive binding with bexarotene, and ApoE level determination in cultured mouse brain cells. A small number of drug-like compounds will be obtained through multiple iterations of the two steps of in-silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biochemical assays will identify drug-like compounds that can clear toxic chemicals responsible for Alzheimer's Disease from brain cells with minimal side-effects. These compounds will form the starting point for the first true cure of Alzheimer's Disease by slowing and reversing its effects.",Discovery of A-beta Oligomer Antagonists via 3D Pharmacophore Space Analysis,8253357,R43GM100664,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bexarotene', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Line', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Competitive Binding', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Headache', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Humulus', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mus', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Oral', 'Outcome Study', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RXR', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Space Models', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'drug candidate', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'social', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2012,183000,-0.016350317206492774
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.               The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections.

"Identification of Biomarkers of Cardiotoxicity using Metabolomics of Human Plurip    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiotoxicity, as a result of adverse drug effects, is a serious problem that has yet to be effectively screened prior to patient exposure. Cardiac safety is one of the leading causes of compound attrition in the pharmaceutical industry and withdrawal of FDA-approved drugs from the market. The purpose of this proposal is to alleviate the financial burden of compound attrition due to cardiotoxicity, but more importantly, to improve public health through the development of an in vitro assay to predict a drug's ability to induce cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery (""Stemina"") proposes to do so through the use of metabolomics on treated cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem (hES) and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. These technologies will be used to discover human endogenous small molecule biomarkers which predict cardiotoxicity, with an emphasis on cardiomyopathy. The use of metabolomics to measure small molecules secreted by human cardiomyocytes in response to drugs is a novel approach and may pave the way for a new generation of more accurate predictive toxicology screens. Stemina has already used such a paradigm to develop predictive methods to assess development toxicology in stem cells. Stemina's long-term goal is to fully develop this humanized, high throughput cardiotoxicity screen so that it would be a valuable tool to pharmaceutical and biotech companies during preclinical development of therapeutics. In order to achieve this long term goal, Stemina is first proposing to establish an experimental platform for each cardiomyocyte culture system (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will use these systems to develop a dose response curve for each of the 24 compounds (16 cardiotoxic and 10 non-cardiotoxic) as a training set to establish a predictive metabolomic model. These dose response curves will be used to determine 3 concentrations for drug treatment to be utilized in Aim 3. Stemina will then establish a specific metabolic signature of candidate human biomarkers of drug-induced cardiotoxicity (Aim 3). To do so, human pluripotent stem (hPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes will be treated with well-established known inducers and non-inducers of cardiotoxiciy. The spent medium from treated cells will be analyzed with mass spectrometry in order to study the secreted metabolites, or secretome, of these cells. Small molecules whose abundances vary dependent upon whether cells were treated with an inducer or non-inducer of cardiotoxicity will serve as candidate biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. In future studies, these candidate biomarkers will be validated through the use of specialized mass spectrometry techniques. Lastly, the ability of these biomarkers to adequately predict cardiotoxicity will be tested through the use of a blind study. Completion of these aims will encourage further discussions with partnering companies in order to develop a kit that can detect the validated biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. Stemina will then utilize this kit to market a service to predict whether or not a compound will induce cardiotoxicity that will serve pharmaceutical companies in pre-clinical screening trials. Such a service will provide the first humanized screening assay for cardiotoxicity based on cardiomyocyte metabolism and will likely improve public health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery proposes to develop biomarkers of cardiotoxicity that would drive a service model to predict the cardiotoxicity-potential of drug candidates in order to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients. Such a product will greatly improve public health.           Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1).

Over the past few years exciting strides in our understanding of the mechanistic basis of this disorder have been made. Thus the field is poised to make a major breakthrough and develop a drug for this disorder. We have developed a sensitive high throughput screen (HTS) to identify compounds that cure or ameliorate pathologies associated with myotonic dystrophy.

"Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant project is the development and pre-validation of the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt), a tiered testing strategy consisting of a battery of four alternative ocular irritancy assays, which will replace regulatory mandated acute ocular irritation testing using the Draize Rabbit Eye test. ROBatt consists of the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay (BCOP), the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay using 10-day fertile chicken eggs (CAMVA), the Porcine Corneal Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) and the Porcine Confocal Assay (PorFocal). This tiered strategy follows a decision tree that allows for a thorough interrogation of possible ocular irritants. Although four assays are recommended, in most cases only two or three will be used depending on the degree of irritation. The Specific Aim of the ROBatt project is to validate the decision tree variables using at least 50 chemicals listed in the European Center for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) data bank, including Corrosive (EEC R41, GHS/EPA Cat 1), Severe (EEC R36, GHS CaL 2, HMIS 2), Moderate (EPA Cat. 3, HMIS 2), Mild (HMIS 1) and Non-irritating (EPA Cat 4, HMIS 0). The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. This proposal seeks to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced. In most cases, these safety assessments are performed using the Draize Rabbit Eye test, resulting in thousands of rabbits used in testing every year. Alternatives have been discussed since the 80s without any appreciable acceptance from regulators.           n/a",Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt),8068095,U01NS073481,"['Acute', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cattle', 'Chemicals', 'Chickens', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Opacity', 'Corrosives', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'European', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Felis catus', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Instruction', 'Irritants', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Permeability', 'Public Health', 'Safety', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Validation', 'chorioallantoic membrane', 'consumer product', 'egg', 'irritation']",NINDS,"MB RESEARCH LABORATORIES, INC.",U01,2010,562935,0.033275318114647116
"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. The time required to bring a new drug into the market has not decreased, though the cost for drug discovery is steadily increasing. The root causes of this problem are related to efficacy, toxicity, and inappropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as shown by recent rigorous analyses. To focus on the ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) issues, pharmaceutical research groups have, since the late 1990s, moved various physicochemical property screens earlier in the drug discovery process. The metabolic transformations of pharmaceuticals profoundly impact their bioavailability, efficacy, chronic toxicity, metabolic idiosyncrasies, excretion rates and routes. Metabolism is one of the major hurdles to overcome. In silico tools enable fast and virtual screening of large numbers of compounds before compounds are synthesized. Such tools enable researchers to recognize complicated metabolic processes, to eliminate poor candidates, and then to use the knowledge gained to discern possible deficiencies in compounds. Still poorly understood, metabolism is the most difficult to predict. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a system to predict xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, and to gain insights into metabolism mechanisms (aim 1), and to study the differences in metabolism between humans and model animals (aim 2). We will use MDL's Metabolite database as a source of information about drug metabolism reactions. For aim 1, we will develop both global metabolism prediction systems, which can be applied to diverse substrate without prior knowledge of enzymes, and local models for particular enzymes, when prior knowledge of the enzymes involved in reactions is available. Global metabolism prediction systems will comprise many individual models, each of which will focus on an animal species (e.g., humans), an enzyme (e.g., CYP3A4) and a specific biotransformation (e.g., hydroxylation). Machine learning techniques will be used to build each individual model using various features to characterize the chemical environments of functional groups within molecules. For local models for an enzyme, we assume that the tight binding of ligands and enzymes is not required, but rather that reactions occur at sites where enzymes can easily attack. We will design ways to model the probability that a particular site will be attacked by enzymes. In Aim 1, both the global metabolism prediction system and the local models are trained on human reactions, so the models are animal specific. In Aim 2, we will build models for rat, which is a model animal in drug development. Using rat reactions listed in MDL's Metabolite database, we will establish a global metabolism system for rats and local models for rats using the same methods outlined in Aim 1. Though the methods are the same, the training sets are different, and it is expected that the models will make different predictions. By using drugs that are known to be metabolized differently in humans and rats, we will study differences in the human and rat models.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7850408,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,26557,0.05391425381202461
"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7625039,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,536571,0.03913316941891145

"Classification Algorithms for Chemical Compounds Computational techniques that build models to correctly assign chemical compounds to various classes of interests have extensive applications in pharmaceutical research and are used extensively at various phases during the drug development process. These techniques are used to solve a number of classification problems such as predicting whether or not a chemical compound has the desired biological activity, is toxic or non-toxic, and filtering out drug-like compounds from large compound libraries. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop substructure-based classification algorithms for chemical compound datasets. The key elements of these algorithms are that they (i) utilize highly efficient substructure discovery algorithms to mine the chemical compounds and discover all substructures that can be critical for the classification task, (ii) use multiple criteria to generate a set of substructure-based features that simultaneously simplify the compounds' representation while retaining and exposing the features that are responsible for the specific classification problem, and (iii) build predictive models by employing kernel-based methods that take into account the relationships between these substructures at different levels of granularity and complexity, as well as information provided by traditional descriptors. n/a",Classification Algorithms for Chemical Compounds,7495003,R01LM008713,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Consensus', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Descriptor', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Figs - dietary', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Numbers', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'base', 'design', 'desire', 'drug development', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,270892,0.0771833970425478
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips.

"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3).

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7440169,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Numbers', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,535031,0.03913316941891145
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7387471,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,220227,-0.030972060236641796
"Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary. This project will investigate and develop effective information technologies for comparative analysis and visualization of complex data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). GCxGC is an emerging technology that provides an order-of-magnitude greater separation capacity, significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and higher dimensional retention-structure relations than traditional GC. The principal challenge for utilization of GCxGC, in a wide range of public-health and other applications, is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large, complex data it generates. The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data necessitates the investigation and development of new information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate innovative methods and tools for comparative analysis of GCxGC datasets. The expected results of this research and development include a PCA-based method for chemical fingerprinting, decision trees with chemical constraints for sample classification, genetic programming for template and constraint-based matching and classification, and visualization methods for comparative GCxGC analyses. These methods will be implemented in commercial software that will support researchers and laboratory analysts in a wide range of commercial applications, including health care, environmental monitoring, and chemical processing. The power of GCxGC, supported by effective information technologies, will enable better understanding of chemical compositions and processes, a foundation for future scientific advances and discoveries. Relevance to Public Health. Today, a few advanced laboratories are pioneering GCxGC for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring of exposure profiles in air, soil, food, and water; identification and quantification of toxic products in blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and qualitative and quantitative metabolomics to provide a holistic view of the biochemical status or biochemical phenotype of an organism. Many analyses in these applications require detailed chemical comparisons of samples, e.g..monitoring changes, comparison to reference standards, chemical matching or ""fingerprinting"", and classification. GCxGC is a powerful new technology for such comparative analyses.

The framework will have a significant impact on compound prioritization, chemical library design, and candidate selection for preclinical and clinical development.            n/a",Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling,7244058,R21GM076059,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biological Availability', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End Point', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'career', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genotoxicity', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'member', 'method development', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'reproductive', 'skills', 'small molecule libraries', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water solubility']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2007,328325,0.019692779220846328
"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7240459,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Numbers', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,543226,0.03913316941891145
"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7214118,R42ES013321,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug toxicity', 'End Point', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'highly advanced system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'metabolomics', 'quantum', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'subtraction hybridization', 'tool']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2007,257269,0.019239802770636777
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,-0.030972060236641796

"Classification Algorithms for Chemical Compounds Computational techniques that build models to correctly assign chemical compounds to various classes of interests have extensive applications in pharmaceutical research and are used extensively at various phases during the drug development process. These techniques are used to solve a number of classification problems such as predicting whether or not a chemical compound has the desired biological activity, is toxic or non-toxic, and filtering out drug-like compounds from large compound libraries. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop substructure-based classification algorithms for chemical compound datasets. The key elements of these algorithms are that they (i) utilize highly efficient substructure discovery algorithms to mine the chemical compounds and discover all substructures that can be critical for the classification task, (ii) use multiple criteria to generate a set of substructure-based features that simultaneously simplify the compounds' representation while retaining and exposing the features that are responsible for the specific classification problem, and (iii) build predictive models by employing kernel-based methods that take into account the relationships between these substructures at different levels of granularity and complexity, as well as information provided by traditional descriptors. n/a",Classification Algorithms for Chemical Compounds,7127208,R01LM008713,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'conformation', 'drug classification', 'mathematical model', 'mathematics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,R01,2006,276362,0.0771833970425478
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7125565,R01EB006200,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2006,399410,0.05391425381202461

"In Silico Assesment of Drug Metabolism and Toxicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Failure of molecules in the late stages of drug development are to a large extent attributable to poor ADME/Tox properties. These properties are generally predictable in the earlier, cheaper stages of drug discovery. The goal of this work is to predict metabolism and toxicity using a computational suite called MetaDrug. This integrates human endogenous and xenobiotic metabolic as well as signalling pathways and can also incorporate gene expression, and experimental data. Under phase I, novel algorithms for predicting major CYP-mediated pathways were generated and successfully validated along with rules for predicting metabolites and reactive metabolites formed which are likely to be toxic. This algorithm development enabled the prediction of substrates and metabolites, the affinity and the rate of metabolism as well as interactions with other endogenous, metabolic and signalling pathways. With phase II funding we will develop large comprehensive datasets (>1000 molecules) for in vitro drug-drug interactions with the major CYPs, and use these for generating machine learning algorithms for these human drug metabolizing enzymes. We will also annotate rat and mouse data for drug metabolism and the transcriptional regulation of these enzymes, capturing the kinetic data which can also be used for predictive model building. We will also generate a novel algorithm for the accurate prediction of metabolites using the metabolite rules from phase I to produce a molecular fingerprint for known drugs. The database of molecules with known human metabolites will then be used as an input for a machine learning algorithm. We will combine the predictions from our various QSAR models for enzyme affinity and rate of metabolism, the relative contributions of these enzymes and their tissue distribution, to ultimately predict the clearance of a drug. The proposed work will enable GeneGo to develop a unique tool that will improve the prediction of metabolism and toxicity.

"Computational Toxicity Assessment Using Omic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The application of modern high throughput genomic and metabonomic technologies to the field of toxicology will provide significant breakthroughs and advances.

Using statistical and mathematical algorithms applied to high throughput data, toxicant exposure characterization will be computed including identification of type of exposure and estimates of dose amount. In the current proposal, we intend to apply the latest multivariate linear and non-linear statistical and mathematical techniques to find subtle and complex patterns in the data that are consistent with validated samples of known toxic exposure. By using supervised machine learning techniques, training data with cross-validated measurements will be used to quantitatively measure the accuracy of the proposed statistical techniques. By applying these techniques to a wide variety of both public and in house data samples consisting of gene expression data and metabolomic NMR concentration data, small correlations and patterns can be measured and used to characterize the type and amount of environmental and toxicant exposure to host organisms.

This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7012638,R01EB006200,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2005,363523,0.05391425381202461
"Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions. A CNN-based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) module makes toxicological predictions based only on structure-activity analyses; a second CNN/wavelet module makes independent toxicogenomic predictions using microarray data; and a third CNN/wavelet module makes toxicogenomic predictions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data. This multi-intelligent, three-module approach provides crosschecks to reduce false positives and false negatives while substantially increasing confidence in predictions relative to current computer-based toxicity prediction techniques. The resulting product could potentially become a primary tool used by (a) human health researchers, b) pharmaceutical companies for screening drugs early during development, c) companies designing/developing new chemicals and chemically treated materials, and (d) government organizations (e.g., military) for mission-related chemical deployments. Public benefits include reduced health and environmental risks (e.g., 4 out of 5 chemicals in use today have inadequate testing); reduced reliance on animal testing; and reduced time and cost required to bring new pharmaceuticals and chemicals into beneficial medical and commercial use.            n/a",Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction,6743871,R41ES013321,"['computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'evaluation /testing', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'toxicant screening', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R41,2004,211770,0.039257101836673546

TENT deploys computational neural nets (CNN), innovative computational chemistry methods, and modem statistical regression methods into interactive modules that determine (a) a chemical's 3-D structure and physical chemistry properties, (b) Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships, (C) mechanistic modes leading to toxicological responses via microassay database analysis, and (d) a broad spectrum of toxicological properties via CNN 3-D structural similarity analyses. TENTs output includes physical chemistry properties, 3-D structure, predicted toxicological impacts, and confidence level associated with each. It is anticipated that TENT will become one of the primary tools used by (a) researchers in human health and toxicological fields, (b) pharmaceutical companies to screen out drugs early in the development process prior to expending hundreds of millions on clinical in vivo and in vitro testing, (C) by companies developing new chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemically treated materials to determine potential toxicological impacts including those caused by environmental changes during and after usage, (d) companies striving to show compliance with ISO 14000 for materials used in their products, and (e) federal and military organizations for chemicals and materials contemplated for use in their mission areas.

"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators. This computational approach will be validated using in vitro testing and offers several advantages to identify potential novel or repurposed molecules as MCM including speed and cost-effectiveness.",MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems,10094026,R43ES031038,"['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Ache', 'Address', 'Adenosine', 'Adenosine A1 Receptor', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Chlorine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'In Vitro', 'Licensing', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Privatization', 'PubChem', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'computational toxicology', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'novel', 'pesticide poisoning', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary agents', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,124915,0.01073759062625605
"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,10055938,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,155686,0.019020852823584768
"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,0.0033395327245582993
"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10033377,R01HD102537,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Compound Q', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'screening program', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'web-based tool']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542483,0.01497881657104205
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9964494,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.011445848801961221
"Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10142097,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2020,67446,0.009608903902450516
"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize small molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites provide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding of health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities associated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and advances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large majority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning partial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification can inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite annotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show in our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in machine-learning tasks such as annotation.  This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench by: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding characterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns (motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated with aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use variational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to identify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We generate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.  In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and as a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this mapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such a classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim 1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can be used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to generate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks. Relevance to Public Health The project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data set hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and information about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures. We anticipate that our techniques will result in annotating and adding information to the data set, which in turn will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset,10111982,R03OD030601,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gene Expression', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histidine', 'Human', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'cost', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'neural network', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool']",OD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2020,263120,0.045442635783856974
"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9899255,R01GM114029,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diverse data', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'small molecule', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,336869,0.07290384632334863
"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature.

"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,-0.010924991498209498
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9846198,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,1140875,0.039537078569626065
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9889134,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,356625,0.05647550358643737
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients. We will make and test predictions about which chemical compounds will have benefit, either alone or in combination.","Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity",9947374,R01AG066750,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Blue Cross', 'Blue Shield', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'FDA approved', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Neurons', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'machine learning method', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'validation studies']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,885874,-0.03628942624462891
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9838229,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2020,474671,0.017252462713473846
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health.

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements.

Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a new spectroscopic technique – Time-dependent Infrared Reflection Spectroscopy Assay (TIRSA) – that will enable us to measure the real-time spectral response of a cell to various pharmacological compounds. The uniqueness of TIRSA is that it exploits infrared-reflective plasmonic (gold) metasurfaces to detect, as a function of time, biochemical changes in close proximity of cellular membranes, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization occurring. The optical spectra obtained over the course of several hours after administering the drug will be used to identify its effects on signaling pathways without any labels because vibrational fingerprints of biomolecules are the natural labels. Unlike time-consuming cytotoxic assays, the TIRSA can be potentially as short as several hours, thereby addressing one of the most serious deficiencies of phenotypic assays: their low throughput. Powerful techniques of machine learning (ML) will be used to process the enormous amount of biochemical information obtained by TIRSA, and to conduct supervised and unsupervised data analysis that will be based on large libraries of spectral cellular responses to single-target chemical compounds such as kinase inhibitors and others. New laser-based hardware for TIRSA will enable high sensitivity, time and space resolution. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining time-dependent infrared spectroscopy to determine the Mode of Action (MOA) of various compounds, including apoptosis- inducing cytotoxic compounds as well as kinase inhibitors. We will develop new hardware for laser-based micro- spectroscopy. The resulting Time-Dependent Reflection Spectroscopic Assay (TIRSA) will serve as the first spectroscopy-based whole-cell phenotypic drug assay that will detect cellular responses to anti-cancer compounds and sensitizers.",Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces,10025960,R21CA251052,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Matrix Junction', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug resistance', 'EGF gene', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Fourier Transform', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'anti-cancer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cytotoxic', 'design', 'detector', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infrared spectroscopy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'kinase inhibitor', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'optical spectra', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'plasmonics', 'polypeptide', 'precision drugs', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'temporal measurement', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'vector', 'vibration']",NCI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,598729,0.023377993723736508
"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,10002192,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,427122,0.043122512689478025
"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,9995722,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,395738,0.029151791233130612

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,0.04145492770625136
"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10152786,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,559511,0.03380433685212381

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9921415,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,514429,0.0007788524377408047
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9902210,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'structured data', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2020,748733,0.009530708381019893
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9908105,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,291940,0.037256926690533244
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Developing Drug-like Small Molecules that Target Toxic Repeat RNAs to Alleviate Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1-derived Mis-Splicing Project Summary Abstract Nymirum will utilize its technology platform to identify and optimize a drug-like, orally available small molecule that binds toxic CUG repeat RNAs to rescue myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) derived mis-splicing and treat the disease. DM1 is a rare genetic disorder that leads to progressive muscle degeneration, cardiovascular disease, severe cognitive disabilities, insulin resistance, and a host of other symptoms. There is no cure for DM1, and the only treatments are palliative. The cause of DM1 is an abnormal CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion (>34 repeats) in the 3′-UTR of DMPK that are transcribed into toxic CUG RNA repeats that accumulate in the nucleus of cells. Toxic CUG repeats sequester Muscleblind Like Splicing Regulator 1 (MBNL1), which is needed for normal splicing of hundreds of key neuromuscular related genes. Studies have shown that small molecules that bind CUG repeats can prevent MBNL1 sequestration and rescue nominal splicing in cells and animal models. However, these small molecules are bulky, very polar, and non-drug-like and therefore suffer from delivery and toxicity issues. Therefore the need remains to identify and optimize drug-like, orally available small molecules that bind CUG repeats and rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in cells. Preliminary data highlights that the Nymirum platform has identified two classes of drug-like small molecules that can bind CUG repeats and can rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in HeLa cells. This proposal seeks to go wider and deeper in order to identify and optimize more potent compounds. In Phase I, >2 billion compounds will be rapidly and accurately screened to identify additional classes of chemically diverse drug-like small molecule CUG binders. Those hits will then be optimized at the atomic level using the dynamic CUG structure to guide targeted medicinal chemistry to increase their potency and efficacy in HeLa cells. Phase II will carry out lead-generation in earnest on the hits identified in Phase I. Ultimately, this proposal will develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic to treat DM1. Project Narrative Nymirum is leveraging its platform to develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic that rescues myotonic dystrophy type 1 derived mis-splicing by binding toxic CUG RNA repeats and preventing them from sequestering a key splicing regulator (MBNL1).",Developing Drug-like Small Molecules that Target Toxic Repeat RNAs to Alleviate Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1-derived Mis-Splicing,10135372,R43NS117184,"['Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animal Model', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioavailable', 'Biological Assay', 'CUG repeat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Hela Cells', 'Inherited', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Retardation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Myotonic dystrophy type 1', 'Oral', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Visual impairment', 'cognitive disability', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'interest', 'muscle degeneration', 'neuromuscular', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rare genetic disorder', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'success', 'targeted nucleases', 'three dimensional structure', 'virtual']",NINDS,"NYMIRUM, INC.",R43,2020,299267,0.012912658167751933
"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions.

Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level. Here, we propose to employ our new approach to identify novel environmental inducers of NDD.",Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9979666,R21ES030804,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidotes', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flowcharts', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Protective Agents', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Validation', 'Valproic Acid', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'cell growth', 'cost effective', 'cytotoxicity', 'dashboard', 'environmental chemical', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'histone modification', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phthalates', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell model', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R21,2020,292500,0.013635282299181112
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level. This project will fill the gap between in vitro and in vivo toxicology testing with an effective invertebrate model organism as alternate to vertebrate animal testing.",A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing,10082215,R44MH118841,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research Activity', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Serotonin', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic neuron', 'computational platform', 'connectome', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'developmental toxicity', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'graphical user interface', 'high resolution imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'reproductive toxicity', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'terabyte', 'testing services', 'young adult']",NIMH,"NEWORMICS, LLC",R44,2020,749858,0.007428180748513085
