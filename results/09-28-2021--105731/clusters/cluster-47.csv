"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the second-most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Among the different types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type and it constitutes 85% to 90% of all lung cancer cases. Current cancer research has shown that multiple somatic mutations affect the sensitivity of patients to various drugs used for NSCLC treatment. These mutations are essential factors for determining the most effective, “personalized” treatment for each NSCLC patient; however, most NSCLC patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies in their first year of treatment. Many mechanisms of this resistance are still unknown. Designing and prescribing better targeted therapies for NSCLC patients requires further understanding, particularly with respect to the relationship between NSCLC tumors’ pathological and clinical findings, genetic profiles, and targeted therapy responses/resistance. Currently, there is no computational method to connect observations and findings from pathology reports, medical records, somatic mutations, and the targeted therapy resistance. This project provides a plan to build a novel computational method to identify statistically significant associations between the pathological findings of NSCLC tumors and the presence of clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Furthermore, these associations, in combination with an innovative set of feature analysis from pathology reports and electronic medical records, will be leveraged to build and validate a machine-learning model to identify NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Finally, the associated clinical, pathological, and genetic findings for NSCLC patients will be used in a new machine-learning framework to predict patients’ time-to-resistance to targeted therapies. The required data to build and validate the proposed models in this project will be obtained through a collaboration with the Department of Pathology’s Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technologies at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. In addition to internal validation, the investigators in this proposal established a collaboration with the Department of Pathology at the University of Vermont Medical Center to apply and validate the developed models on an external data source. Upon successful implementation of this bioinformatics approach, the developed models will be able to reveal statistically significant links between clinical and pathological findings, clinically-actionable somatic mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for a better understanding of NSCLC tumor development and treatment. The proposed approach will provide an accurate, fast, and inexpensive pre- selection method for screening NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable mutations for translational research and precision medicine. Furthermore, the proposed machine-learning method to identify NSCLC patients’ resistance to targeted therapies will help healthcare providers to select the best treatment strategies for these patients, improve their health outcomes, and establish this precision medicine paradigm for other types of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Resistance to targeted therapies severely limits the ability to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This project proposes a novel computational approach to find statistically-significant links between pathological and clinical findings, clinically-actionable mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for NSCLC patients. The outcomes of this proposal can assist healthcare providers to identify the most effective strategy for NSCLC treatment, improve public health, and promote precision medicine.",Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management,9726144,R01CA249758,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Semantics', 'Smoking Status', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Pathology', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Woman', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically actionable', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'men', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,375150,-0.024337999157322127
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9704042,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2019,189000,0.08201771284885707
"Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and definitive radiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced, inoperable cases. Radiation therapy is also highly flexible, and can be adapted for variations in tumor volume and location. However, decision support models to optimize treatment planning and avoid morbidity on a patient-by-patient basis are lacking. Recently, the randomized phase III trial, RTOG 0617, compared high dose (74 Gy) treatments to standard (60 Gy) treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and demonstrated an unexpectedly higher rate of mortality in the high-dose arm. We hypothesize that this was primarily due to heart irradiation, in combination with lung irradiation factors. The goal of this project is to determine and validate predictive models of morbidity following thoracic RT, in order to achieve safer and more optimal tradeoffs between local control and morbidity. We will jointly analyze three large, high-quality datasets using innovative image-registration, machine learning, and dose characteristics (dose-based radiomics), to develop mathematical models that could be used to predict and avoid key morbidity endpoints in radiotherapy treatment planning. All endpoints will use dose-distribution comparison methods to examine the correlation between dose and morbidity as a function of anatomic location, thus providing greater assurance that the source of radiotherapy toxicity is correctly identified. Under Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will use innovative deformable image registration methods to map all patient dose distributions to a segmented reference case anatomy (including heart, lungs, bronchii, and blood vessels). The accuracy of the deformations will be mapped carefully using an innovative non-parametric estimation methodology. Tissue regions with high correlations to morbidity will be extracted for machine learning under SAs 2 and 3. Under SA2, we will apply innovative machine learning with the goal of relating dose factors extracted under SA1 with treatment-related death hazard. Under SA3, we will apply the same methodology to the risk of severe pneumonitis. We hypothesize that treatment related death hazard and radiation pneumonitis form a single predictable continuum of increasing risk, and we will attempt to bring together the results of SA2 and SA3 in a single predictive model. Innovative post-modeling analyses of mutually exclusive predictors will be used to make the machine learning models interpretable. The overall goals of this grant are: (1) to advance the state of science in the field of personally-optimized radiation oncology, and (2) to provide decision support tools to guide patient-specific tradeoffs between local control and toxicity in lung cancer radiotherapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lung cancer for locally advanced, inoperable disease is usually treated with radiotherapy, but the cause of severe treatment morbidity is not well understood. Using advanced data analysis methods, we will produce mathematical models that can be used to compare the risks of alternative treatment plans for individual patients, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatment morbidity.",Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy,9685174,R01CA198121,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Support Model', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Fractionation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Pneumonitis', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'alternative treatment', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'classification trees', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'phase III trial', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiomics', 'random forest', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,579921,0.042269544749233064
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9693200,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,440946,0.11008919960288881
"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways. This renewal builds upon our successful UML approach with integration of DL, greatly increased CT and genetic data; validates QES with histology; and translates QES to the clinic in order to facilitate testing of molecular therapies of specific QES and to redefine emphysema subtypes in clinical practice.",Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS,9740637,R01HL121270,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Apical', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Translating', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'c new', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computed tomography screening', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung cancer screening', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,790346,0.04370233896552171
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users.

"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",9646106,K23HL145011,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dysbarism', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Endothelium', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epithelial', 'Esophageal', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Induction of neuromuscular blockade', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manometry', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prone Position', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training Programs', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computerized', 'dynamic system', 'esophagus pressure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'interest', 'lung injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized strategies', 'pressure', 'programs', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2019,170640,0.02506751509114038
"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9698441,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,353562,-0.011709860101552765
"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening. Its availability will significantly reduce the over-diagnosis associated with  LDCT for lung cancer screening and relieve the economic burden on healthcare system. Project Narrative: The project aims to develop an online computer tool to aid in efficacious early  lung cancer screening and diagnosis based on LDCT. This tool will not only locate the pulmonary  nodules automatically, but also quantitatively assess the malignancy of a suspicious nodule and its  prognosis.",A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules,9624736,R44CA203058,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biological Testing', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Economic Burden', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation exposure', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Smoking History', 'Solid', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'image guided', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'physical symptom', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'research and development', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENT INFOR/SOLU/LAB,R44,2019,461098,0.08373632779590796
"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease. This will enable us to identify susceptible patients at the earliest possible moment, track their disease progression, and ultimately shift treatment strategies from palliating disease related symptoms to preventing disease development.",Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT,9646808,K08HL145118,"['Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Award', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Densitometry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Evolution', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Factor', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'exercise capacity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'lung injury', 'mange', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'palliate', 'palliation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoking-related lung disease', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170320,0.034238562086826047
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer has a high fatality rate because most patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when the disease is more difficult to cure.

"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it has the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. Findings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9762965,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'random forest', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2019,614648,0.044394326484958266
"Deep Radiomic Analysis of Coronary Heart Disease with Lung Screening CT Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) caused 17.7 million deaths in 2015, accounting for one third of all deaths globally. Amongst 8.8 million cancer-deaths in 2015, lung cancer contributed to 1.69 million deaths worldwide. In the United States, lung cancer will claim 154,050 lives in 2018, representing a quarter of all cancer deaths. Both CVDs and lung cancer share several risk factors, including unhealthy dietary patterns, obesity, and tobacco use. Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT), an effective lung cancer screening technique, reduces the cancer-related mortality rate by 20% in those with history of heavy smoking. Such subjects have substantially higher risk of CVDs than lung cancer. Indeed, most subjects undergoing lung cancer screening with LDCT have an intermediate to high risk for CVDs. Concomitant CVD screening will have profound benefits for these subjects at no additional time, cost, or radiation dose to the patient. The goal of the project is to develop an automated workflow of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk (CARMOR) evaluation with lung cancer screening LDCT data to provide high-risk subjects a “radiation-free” CVD screening without cost or time constraints. Our central hypothesis is that deep radiomics from LDCT follow-up scans and across different reconstructions can effectively improve the performance of CARMOR estimation. To validate our hypothesis, we will perform radiomics analysis on CARMOR with lung cancer screening LDCT scans, and then further enhance the CARMOR features with complementary image reconstructions from the same scan and serial LDCT scans for optimized prognostic performance. The CARMOR quantification methods in lung screening LDCT will be validated retrospectively against multiple subspecialty radiologists with Coronary Computed Tomography Angiogram (CCTA) as the standard of reference. The project requires us to perform analyses over serial LDCT exams and different reconstruction techniques and settings. Therefore, major innovations and improvements need to be made for this challenging deep radiomic analysis task. Since the risk factors of CVDs and lung cancer are closely related with lifestyle, the findings of the project can also be used to create teachable moments for patients to change towards healthier lifestyles. In context of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement of LDCT for lung cancer screening and stress on the importance of considering co-morbidities, our timely project will have a significant impact on the healthcare of a large population. At the end of the project, we will have developed an automated workflow of assessing CARMOR for lung screening LDCT with zero radiation added. We will also have acquired study results to enable personalized patient education to address the long-term health crisis caused by unhealthy lifestyles. Our studies will lead to new understanding of deep radiomics in CVD screening and the impact of LDCT reconstructions in clinical practice. Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is effective in lung cancer screening and can reduce the mortality rate by 20% for the high-risk population. However, heavy smokers are affected by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) even more than by lung cancer and most high-risk subjects undergoing lung cancer screening with LDCT have an intermediate to high risk for CVDs.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9668180,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,166104,0.06313595840001916
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9640679,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,322937,0.005346704435038089
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9678366,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,602448,0.0582438514215742
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9786824,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,192564,-0.00884292786429988
"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9672582,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170639,0.04497581496750766
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,-0.01905722415161567
"Development of a Rapid Method for Imaging Regional Ventilation in Small Animals w/o Contrast Agents The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9747350,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,199098,0.020667569467013078
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9617686,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'risk prediction model', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,507649,0.09082209636975949
"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer. Therefore, the test could complement LDCT for the early detection lung cancer, and thereby reduce the mortality and cost. Here we propose to develop an easy and cost-effective test for accurately distinguishing malignant from benign lung nodules. Future use of the test will complement CT screening for the early detection of lung cancer, and ultimately reduce lung cancer-associated deaths.",A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules,9805358,R21CA240556,"['Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Marriage', 'Medical', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathology', 'Physics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'male', 'men', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'never smoker', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'oncology', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'screening program', 'success', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,201623,0.086394700385391
"The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background and long-term objectives: This proposed research will advance our understanding of how the lung microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of oxygen-induced lung injury. Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies. Yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have recently discovered that hyperoxia acutely alters lung microbiota. This oxygen-induced dysbiosis is strongly and temporally correlated with alveolar inflammation. We have discovered that germ-free mice - experimental mice devoid of microbiota - are protected from oxygen- induced lung injury, an observation that cannot be explained via our conventional model of oxygen-induced lung injury. Conversely, lung injury alters lung microbiota by changing bacterial growth conditions within the lung microenvironment. We have discovered that germ-free mice are protected from non-resolving lung injury (bleomycin), indicating that the microbiome is necessary for perpetuation of lung injury. The discovery of the lung microbiome has thus broadened our model of pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which lung microbiota mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, and are in turn altered by lung injury, are undetermined. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific bacteria within the lung ecosystem propel alveolar inflammation in oxygen-induced lung injury, and these bacteria are enriched within the lung microbiome both by hyperoxia itself and by the altered ecology of injured lungs. The rationale is that these discoveries will facilitate the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of oxygen-related human lung disease. Specific Aim 1: To determine the microbial and molecular pathways by which oxygen therapy alters lung microbiota, mediating host inflammation and injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: in vivo heterogeneity analysis of host-microbiome interactions in mice; in vivo germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated hyperoxia modeling in mice; data science interrogation of observational human data using a validated machine-learning algorithm. Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular pathways by which oxygen-induced host inflammation and injury alter lung microbiota, perpetuating respiratory dysbiosis and lung injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: a novel ex vivo culture assay that identifies host- derived mediators of bacterial growth; in vivo augmentation and inhibition of the host response in hyperoxia. This translational research approach will determine 1) the key members of the lung microbiome that mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, 2) the pathways by which these bacteria promote alveolar inflammation, and 3) the ecologic factors within the injured lung environment that promote their growth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies, yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and severe lung disease. We have recently discovered that the lung microbiome - the communities of microbes living in the respiratory tract - are altered by inhaled oxygen and necessary for the development of oxygen-induced lung injury. This proposed research plan will reveal how the lung microbiome contributes to oxygen-induced lung injury, and provide us with new ways to prevent and treat this common clinical problem.",The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury,9754347,R01HL144599,"['Acute', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Bleomycin', 'Clinical', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Therapy Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Respiratory System', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Translational Research', 'dysbiosis', 'host microbiome', 'host microbiota', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'lung injury', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,422565,0.09091036265950106
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Lung-on-a-chip pulmonary fibrosis model for drug discovery LUNG-ON-A-CHIP PULMONARY FIBROSIS MODEL FOR DRUG DISCOVERY PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a devastating disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and associated scar formation that compromises breathing function and often leads to respiratory failure and death. There are multiple etiologies of PF, including environmental particles, radiation, and even certain antibiotics, but in most cases patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) where the specific trigger is unknown. There is no cure for IPF as current treatments are only capable of slowing lung damage, and prognosis is poor, with a median survival time of 2.5 to 3.5 years after diagnosis. A significant barrier to the development of PF therapeutics is interspecies differences in lung physiology and associated inflammatory and immune responses such that animal models do not sufficiently recapitulate certain aspects of the disease. Recent advances in human organs-on-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture systems that recapitulate the multicellular architecture, tissue-tissue interfaces, mechanical environment (e.g., cyclic breathing motions), and vascular perfusion of major organ functional units have allowed for physiologically based evaluation of cell, environmental, and drug interactions within an organ-level context in vitro. We can utilize these Organ Chips to gain complementary data to animal models about the role of specific cellular contributions to PF development. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop a human Organ Chip model of PF to better understand the mechanism of fibrosis development and progression, and to discover potential new therapeutics that could slow disease progression or reverse this deadly disease. This goal will be achieved with the following two aims: human PF Chips will be engineered with myofibroblasts from healthy donors and PF patients, with the addition of various environmental stimuli as well as potential inflammatory and immune contributors implicated in PF development (Aim 1), and transcriptomics data from these PF Chips will be compared to existing genomics literature data to identify drugs to use as potential PF therapeutics, prioritizing for clinically approved drugs that can be repurposed (Aim 2). This approach is innovative because it will be the first to incorporate all the major components of a human lung microenvironment critical for fibrosis development (human tissue-tissue interactions, breathing motions, perfusion, and environmental stimuli). Completion of these aims will enable analysis of the mechanism of PF development, with the capability to rapidly repurpose existing FDA- approved drugs as potentially life-saving PF therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary fibrosis is a common and devastating disorder without effective pharmacological treatment options, leading to a median survival time of only 2.5 to 3.5 years after diagnosis. To complement animal research models for screening of potential therapeutics, we propose the development of a pulmonary fibrosis model using a cell-based platform that recapitulates the human lung microenvironment. The goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis through characterization of the contribution of donor fibroblasts, environmental factors, and immune and inflammatory cell mediators, then use the knowledge of mechanistic elements to aid in the discovery of new therapeutics for treating pulmonary fibrosis.",Lung-on-a-chip pulmonary fibrosis model for drug discovery,9682914,F32HL146070,"['Alveolar', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bleomycin', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Modelings', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FDA approved', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myofibroblast', 'Organ', 'Particulate', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary alveolar structure', 'Radiation', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Stimulus', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Up-Regulation', 'base', 'chemokine', 'combinatorial', 'cytokine', 'drug discovery', 'human model', 'human tissue', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'in vitro Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'neutrophil', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ on a chip', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,34725,-0.006222272858349452
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9653114,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,696730,-0.009603934964567457
"Genetic interaction analysis involving oncogenesis-related genes in lung cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  The development of cancer diseases is driven by the accumulation of many oncogenesis-related genetic alterations and tumorigenesis is triggered by complex networks of involved genes rather than independent actions. The interactions among genetic factors are believed to play important roles in carcinogenesis and contribute to the missing heritability. In this proposal, we designed a filtered gene-gene interaction analysis aiming to identify the epistasis involving important oncogenesis-related genes. Besides the advantage of dimensional reduction and increased power, this filtered interaction analysis will help us identify novel oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes implicated in lung cancer development that will not be revealed in main effect association analysis. It will also identify novel susceptibility variants, including those in intergenic and non-coding regions, affecting lung cancer risk by interacting/modulating with oncogenesis-related genes. Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease and researchers have identified vast differences in genomic attributes. However, the knowledge about epistatic features in lung cancer subtypes is limited. We will conduct a stratified epistasis analysis by lung cancer histology subtype in the proposed study to reveal subtype-specific genetic interactions and gene networks. The stratified analysis by histology will enhance our understanding about this complicated disease mechanism in lung cancer and has the potential to contribute to precision medicine in lung cancer treatment.  A main challenge in genetic association studies is to understand the functional consequences of identified genetic variants. In this study, we proposed functional annotation analysis including eQTL gene expression analysis, pathway and gene network analysis, and functional annotation of epistasis-involved SNPs. This integrative epistasis and functional annotation analysis will help us pinpoint the causal epistasis and characterize the epistasis-involved genes or regions in lung cancer risk development. It will be a pilot study to explore how the regulatory non-coding variants impact lung cancer risk by interacting with oncogenesis-related genes.  The proposed study will provide insights about the complicated biological interactions that are critical for gene regulation, biochemical networks, and developmental pathways implicated in lung carcinogenesis. In order to finish the proposed study, we collected the genotype data from three independent GWAS studies including 24,037 lung cancer patients and 20,401 healthy controls from the Caucasian population. The genotype and gene expression data in lung tissues from 409 individuals will be applied for eQTL gene expression analysis. NARRATIVE The interactions among genetic factors are believed to play important roles in carcinogenesis and contribute to the missing heritability. In this proposal, we designed an integrative filtered epistasis and functional annotation analysis to identify the genetic interactions involving important oncogenesis-related genes in lung cancer development.

"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,9819260,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoxia', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,2391491,0.06925653663896128
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9765383,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,113241,-0.004750581831353955
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.

By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9951760,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,366168,0.001660903885757671
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9619605,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'bacteriome', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'dysbiosis', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'respiratory microbiome', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,172256,0.03417743060022286
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9703894,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,642740,0.01838481730789955
"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,9626360,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,495096,0.10091792313345052
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9480874,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2018,187699,0.08201771284885707
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9526145,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,480528,0.11008919960288881
"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included.

"Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and definitive radiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced, inoperable cases. Radiation therapy is also highly flexible, and can be adapted for variations in tumor volume and location. However, decision support models to optimize treatment planning and avoid morbidity on a patient-by-patient basis are lacking. Recently, the randomized phase III trial, RTOG 0617, compared high dose (74 Gy) treatments to standard (60 Gy) treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and demonstrated an unexpectedly higher rate of mortality in the high-dose arm. We hypothesize that this was primarily due to heart irradiation, in combination with lung irradiation factors. The goal of this project is to determine and validate predictive models of morbidity following thoracic RT, in order to achieve safer and more optimal tradeoffs between local control and morbidity. We will jointly analyze three large, high-quality datasets using innovative image-registration, machine learning, and dose characteristics (dose-based radiomics), to develop mathematical models that could be used to predict and avoid key morbidity endpoints in radiotherapy treatment planning. All endpoints will use dose-distribution comparison methods to examine the correlation between dose and morbidity as a function of anatomic location, thus providing greater assurance that the source of radiotherapy toxicity is correctly identified. Under Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will use innovative deformable image registration methods to map all patient dose distributions to a segmented reference case anatomy (including heart, lungs, bronchii, and blood vessels). The accuracy of the deformations will be mapped carefully using an innovative non-parametric estimation methodology. Tissue regions with high correlations to morbidity will be extracted for machine learning under SAs 2 and 3. Under SA2, we will apply innovative machine learning with the goal of relating dose factors extracted under SA1 with treatment-related death hazard. Under SA3, we will apply the same methodology to the risk of severe pneumonitis. We hypothesize that treatment related death hazard and radiation pneumonitis form a single predictable continuum of increasing risk, and we will attempt to bring together the results of SA2 and SA3 in a single predictive model. Innovative post-modeling analyses of mutually exclusive predictors will be used to make the machine learning models interpretable. The overall goals of this grant are: (1) to advance the state of science in the field of personally-optimized radiation oncology, and (2) to provide decision support tools to guide patient-specific tradeoffs between local control and toxicity in lung cancer radiotherapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lung cancer for locally advanced, inoperable disease is usually treated with radiotherapy, but the cause of severe treatment morbidity is not well understood. Using advanced data analysis methods, we will produce mathematical models that can be used to compare the risks of alternative treatment plans for individual patients, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatment morbidity.",Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy,9477682,R01CA198121,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Support Model', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Fractionation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Pneumonitis', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Trees', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'alternative treatment', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'hazard', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'phase III trial', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiomics', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,577261,0.042269544749233064
"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening. Its availability will significantly reduce the over-diagnosis associated with  LDCT for lung cancer screening and relieve the economic burden on healthcare system. Project Narrative: The project aims to develop an online computer tool to aid in efficacious early  lung cancer screening and diagnosis based on LDCT. This tool will not only locate the pulmonary  nodules automatically, but also quantitatively assess the malignancy of a suspicious nodule and its  prognosis.",A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules,9463945,R44CA203058,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biological Testing', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation exposure', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Smoking History', 'Solid', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'image guided', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'physical symptom', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'research and development', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENT INFOR/SOLU/LAB,R44,2018,529613,0.08373632779590796
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer has a high fatality rate because most patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when the disease is more difficult to cure.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9411095,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2018,699626,-0.009603934964567457
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9473087,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,601486,0.0582438514215742
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9666652,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192564,-0.00884292786429988
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,9492745,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'MicroRNAs', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'small airways disease', 'study population', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,860223,0.012197065989674814
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9460547,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2018,166104,0.06313595840001916
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,-0.014184142237562307
"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9503881,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2018,170640,0.04497581496750766
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9536120,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2018,198669,0.020667569467013078
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9395897,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,621132,0.09082209636975949
"Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound Project Summary Thyroid cancer is the most-common endocrine malignancy. Its incidence has tripled in the last thirty years. Diagnosis of thyroid cancer is difficult because 50% of people older than 65 have at least 1 thyroid nodule, but only 10% of the nodules are cancerous. Approximately 1.6 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to detect thyroid cancer. Conventional ultrasound is used to identify nodules that warrant a needle biopsy. However, 65% of needle biopsies are negative for cancer and 30% are “indeterminate.” The indeterminate nodules are surgically removed for definitive diagnosis and 75% of them prove to be benign. Therefore, well more than 80% of initially presenting nodules undergo unnecessary biopsies and more than 20% of them also undergo subsequent unnecessary surgery procedures. Accordingly, the broad objective of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS) methods to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules reliably and thereby to reduce the enormous cost and risks associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgical excisions. The first aim of the project is to develop and asses the ability of QUS to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules and to compare the ability of QUS to the ability of conventional methods to select nodules that warrant biopsies; the second aim is to expand QUS methods by combining existing QUS measures developed by Riverside Research with measures derived from so-called B-flow- imaging (BFI) and shear-wave-elasticity (SWE) techniques developed by GE; the third aim is to formulate an objective basis for planning future, prospective studies to translate the findings of the present study to a commercial instrument that can bring QUS-based nodule evaluation into the clinic. To achieve these three aims, QUS performance in classifying cancerous and benign nodules will be compared to the performance of conventional ultrasound and the results of fine needle cytology, molecular marker analyses, and, in the cases of that undergo surgical excision, histology, will used as gold standards. Classification will be performed using standard, well understood, linear, and non-linear methods, such as linear-discriminant analysis and support- vector machines respectively. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated in the proposed project, and if the demonstration of feasibility ultimately leads to future incorporation into an instrument capable of real-time QUS analysis for reliable nodule evaluation, then a highly significant technological advance will be realized that can provide valuable, risk-reducing, cost-effective health-care benefits for patients presenting with thyroid nodules.   PROJECT NARRATIVE: Thyroid cancer rates have tripled in the last thirty years, but current methods of diagnosis are very inefficient. Far too many thyroid biopsies and surgeries are performed with >80% of biopsies and >25% of thyroid surgeries being performed on benign nodules. The advanced ultrasound methods to be evaluated in this proposal seek to drastically reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and surgeries of benign thyroid nodules.",Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound,9405532,R21CA212744,"['Achievement', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asses', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cytology', 'Cytology Histology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Elasticity', 'Endocrine', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'base', 'calcification', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'elastography', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lymph nodes', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'statistics']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,190102,0.0006445137377644957
"DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging. Aim 3: Evaluate the diagnostic capability of P-XPC imaging in two pre-clinical animal models of disease in vivo. The proposed research will result in a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X-ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for functional lung imaging in small animal models. It will provide spatially- and temporally- resolved information regarding lung ventilation that will be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases.",DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS,9474118,R01EB023045,"['Address', 'Air', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Breathing', 'Communities', 'Contrast Media', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technical Degree', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'animal imaging', 'base', 'computer studies', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'detector', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'falls', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'lung injury', 'lung pressure', 'lung volume', 'microCT', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'rapid technique', 'respiratory']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,408541,0.027670698042294432
"Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD Project Summary Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation and/or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Using several NIH and foundation grants, we have systematically generated genetic, genomics, proteomic, and metabolomics profiles from the NHLBI supported COPDGene cohort, which includes 10,300 current and former smokers age 45-80. This proposal will focus on integrating the omics data generated in the five-year followup (Phase II) of the COPDgene study to identify molecular subtypes of COPD across a broad range of blood profiles (Specific Aim 1). Biomarkers and pathways discriminating the molecular subtypes, in addition to other COPD phenotypes will then be identified (Specific Aim 2). These results will identify markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease and can be used to develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD. Relevance to Public Health Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. This proposal will use already collected data on existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,9410515,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,323434,-0.034461304910651296
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it ha s the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. F indings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9538813,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'forest', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2018,636113,0.04456565634372793
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9592308,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,113241,-0.004750581831353955
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9536156,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,563079,0.001660903885757671
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9413355,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'bacteriome', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'dysbiosis', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'respiratory microbiome', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,171176,0.03417743060022286
"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,9446631,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,532539,0.10091792313345052
"Imaging Biomarkers of Severe Respiratory Infections in Premature Infants ABSTRACT  Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in premature infants. Clinical tools to predict and prevent severe LRTI in premature pediatric patients are critically needed to allow early interventions to decrease the high morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Although imaging biomarkers of lung disease from computed tomography have been successfully used in adults, they entail heightened risks for children due to cumulative radiation and the need for sedation. Our goal is to address these gaps and improve clinical practice by developing an objective imaging biomarker framework to assess the risk of severe respiratory disease in premature babies using non-invasive low-radiation X-ray imaging.  Previous efforts lead by Dr. Linguraru (Principal Investigator) at Children's National Health System (CNHS) have focused on developing technical components to quantify lung structural data from chest X-ray (CXR) in children. The image processing pipeline developed at CNHS integrates three novel technical components: a) automatic lung segmentation, b) obtrusive object removal in CXR, and c) severity quantification of lung pathology. These innovations enabled the development of a quantitative imaging software technology to quantify Lung Air trapping and Irregular opacities Radiological analyzer (LungAIR).  This Phase I project builds on the methodology developed in preliminary work. We will analyze a large database (n=200) of retrospective CXR images from premature infants with known clinical outcomes, and further develop and validate lung imaging biomarkers. In Specific Aim 1 we will design and implement a prototype of the software technology (LungAIR) for the localization and quantification of heterogeneous aeration patterns in each lung quadrant through quantitative imaging algorithms. A graphical user interface will also be developed for the simple clinical use of the technology. In Specific Aim 2 we will perform clinical outcome analysis to correlate these biomarkers with the severity of lung disease. We will also combine our new imaging biomarkers with clinical parameters to design and evaluate a predictive model of LRTI risk in the first year of life to optimize the clinical management and improve the outcomes for premature babies.  In this project, CNHS partners with Kitware to translate our research into a clinical software application and lay the groundwork for further developments and clinical studies in Phase II. In summary, our approach will enable better clinical management of diseases of prematurity leading to novel diagnostic strategies to improve treatment and outcomes for the highly vulnerable population of premature infants. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in premature infants.

"A Systems Biology Approach to Mapping Aging in the lung PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for an NRSA Individual Fellowship is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to provide a rich environment for learning and growth to support the candidate's development into an effective physician- scientist, and 2) to generate a molecular map of aging in the lung by applying a systems biology approach to the analysis of transcriptomic data obtained over the lifespan of the laboratory mouse. The candidate and his mentors have designed a specific training plan that includes a rigorous research component and lays the foundation for a successful career. Aging is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to diseases that affect the lung, however, the biological mechanisms contributing to this are not understood. The candidate will employ a systems biology approach to analyze already generated datasets to identify molecular pathways of aging in the lung. A better understanding of aging in the lung may ultimately lead to the development of novel therapies for lung diseases in older adults. Gene expression profiling using RNA-Seq has been used to generate “maps” of tissues by depicting tissues and purified constituent cellular populations on a molecular level. Transcriptional profiles from individuals with disease have been compared to those from healthy individuals in an attempt to develop “signatures” for a given disease. These signatures can be useful for disease diagnosis as well as for identifying targets for therapy. This proposal focuses on the contributions of two abundant cell populations in the lung, alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells (AT2), to the transcriptional signatures of aging in the lung. The candidate has preliminary data demonstrating evidence of an aging signature in alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells purified from mice at 18 months compared with 3 months. This signature persists during an influenza A virus infection challenge. The purpose of this proposal is to employ a systems biology approach to analyze transcriptomic data already obtained by investigators in the candidate's laboratory that includes whole lung tissue, alveolar macrophages, and AT2 cells harvested from mice over the lifespan (2 weeks, and 6,12,18 and 24 months of age). In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will generate a transcriptional map of aging in murine whole lung and purified cellular populations of alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will determine whether the transcriptional signature of aging in alveolar macrophages is cell autonomous or is driven by changes in the alveolar local microenvironment. Over the course of this award, the candidate will learn new systems biology approaches to analyzing large time-series genomic datasets and will develop a comprehensive understanding of the age-related changes in the innate immune system of the lung. The skills developed as part of this project will serve as a guide for the analysis of similar genomic data harvested from aging humans with lung disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aging is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to diseases that affect the lung, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, and lung infections. The mechanisms contributing to the increased susceptibility of older adults to these diseases are unknown. We hope to identify novel mechanisms of aging in the lung that ultimately lead to new therapeutic options for diseases of the lung in older adults.",A Systems Biology Approach to Mapping Aging in the lung,9598302,F32HL136111,"['Address', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Animals', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cells', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronology', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fellowship', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune System', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Virus Diseases', 'age related', 'aged', 'alveolar type II cell', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'forest', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'juvenile animal', 'lung development', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'skills', 'surfactant', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F32,2018,58282,0.045820336951539024
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9316700,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical imaging', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2017,187400,0.08201771284885707
"Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and definitive radiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced, inoperable cases. Radiation therapy is also highly flexible, and can be adapted for variations in tumor volume and location. However, decision support models to optimize treatment planning and avoid morbidity on a patient-by-patient basis are lacking. Recently, the randomized phase III trial, RTOG 0617, compared high dose (74 Gy) treatments to standard (60 Gy) treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and demonstrated an unexpectedly higher rate of mortality in the high-dose arm. We hypothesize that this was primarily due to heart irradiation, in combination with lung irradiation factors. The goal of this project is to determine and validate predictive models of morbidity following thoracic RT, in order to achieve safer and more optimal tradeoffs between local control and morbidity. We will jointly analyze three large, high-quality datasets using innovative image-registration, machine learning, and dose characteristics (dose-based radiomics), to develop mathematical models that could be used to predict and avoid key morbidity endpoints in radiotherapy treatment planning. All endpoints will use dose-distribution comparison methods to examine the correlation between dose and morbidity as a function of anatomic location, thus providing greater assurance that the source of radiotherapy toxicity is correctly identified. Under Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will use innovative deformable image registration methods to map all patient dose distributions to a segmented reference case anatomy (including heart, lungs, bronchii, and blood vessels). The accuracy of the deformations will be mapped carefully using an innovative non-parametric estimation methodology. Tissue regions with high correlations to morbidity will be extracted for machine learning under SAs 2 and 3. Under SA2, we will apply innovative machine learning with the goal of relating dose factors extracted under SA1 with treatment-related death hazard. Under SA3, we will apply the same methodology to the risk of severe pneumonitis. We hypothesize that treatment related death hazard and radiation pneumonitis form a single predictable continuum of increasing risk, and we will attempt to bring together the results of SA2 and SA3 in a single predictive model. Innovative post-modeling analyses of mutually exclusive predictors will be used to make the machine learning models interpretable. The overall goals of this grant are: (1) to advance the state of science in the field of personally-optimized radiation oncology, and (2) to provide decision support tools to guide patient-specific tradeoffs between local control and toxicity in lung cancer radiotherapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lung cancer for locally advanced, inoperable disease is usually treated with radiotherapy, but the cause of severe treatment morbidity is not well understood. Using advanced data analysis methods, we will produce mathematical models that can be used to compare the risks of alternative treatment plans for individual patients, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatment morbidity.",Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy,9271942,R01CA198121,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Support Model', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Fractionation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Pneumonitis', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Trees', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'alternative treatment', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'hazard', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'phase III trial', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiomics', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'treatment planning', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2017,577764,0.042269544749233064
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics. We propose to use multiple types of biologic data to identify different COPD subtypes, which may be important for disease prognosis and treatment.",Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,9295208,K08HL136928,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Expert Opinion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung volume reduction surgery', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'SNP array', 'Severities', 'Spirometry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'learning strategy', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2017,172800,0.06823146688172461
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9306198,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,352350,-0.0008647104035689531
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,-0.003842575021531535
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment.

"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9356362,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'rural area', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2017,164421,0.0508297735063727
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9310591,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2017,607934,0.0582438514215742
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,9281906,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'MicroRNAs', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'small airways disease', 'study population', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,859987,0.012197065989674814
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9238793,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2017,166104,0.06313595840001916
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,-0.014184142237562307
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9324356,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2017,198838,0.020667569467013078
"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9258221,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,609467,0.09082209636975949
"DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging. Aim 3: Evaluate the diagnostic capability of P-XPC imaging in two pre-clinical animal models of disease in vivo. The proposed research will result in a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X-ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for functional lung imaging in small animal models. It will provide spatially- and temporally- resolved information regarding lung ventilation that will be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases.",DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID METHOD FOR IMAGING REGIONAL VENTILATION IN SMALL ANIMALS W/O CONTRAST AGENTS,9309904,R01EB023045,"['Address', 'Air', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Breathing', 'Communities', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technical Degree', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'animal imaging', 'base', 'computer studies', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'detector', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'falls', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'lung injury', 'lung pressure', 'lung volume', 'microCT', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'rapid technique', 'respiratory']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,489676,0.027670698042294432
"Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound Project Summary Thyroid cancer is the most-common endocrine malignancy. Its incidence has tripled in the last thirty years. Diagnosis of thyroid cancer is difficult because 50% of people older than 65 have at least 1 thyroid nodule, but only 10% of the nodules are cancerous. Approximately 1.6 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to detect thyroid cancer. Conventional ultrasound is used to identify nodules that warrant a needle biopsy. However, 65% of needle biopsies are negative for cancer and 30% are “indeterminate.” The indeterminate nodules are surgically removed for definitive diagnosis and 75% of them prove to be benign. Therefore, well more than 80% of initially presenting nodules undergo unnecessary biopsies and more than 20% of them also undergo subsequent unnecessary surgery procedures. Accordingly, the broad objective of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS) methods to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules reliably and thereby to reduce the enormous cost and risks associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgical excisions. The first aim of the project is to develop and asses the ability of QUS to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules and to compare the ability of QUS to the ability of conventional methods to select nodules that warrant biopsies; the second aim is to expand QUS methods by combining existing QUS measures developed by Riverside Research with measures derived from so-called B-flow- imaging (BFI) and shear-wave-elasticity (SWE) techniques developed by GE; the third aim is to formulate an objective basis for planning future, prospective studies to translate the findings of the present study to a commercial instrument that can bring QUS-based nodule evaluation into the clinic. To achieve these three aims, QUS performance in classifying cancerous and benign nodules will be compared to the performance of conventional ultrasound and the results of fine needle cytology, molecular marker analyses, and, in the cases of that undergo surgical excision, histology, will used as gold standards. Classification will be performed using standard, well understood, linear, and non-linear methods, such as linear-discriminant analysis and support- vector machines respectively. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated in the proposed project, and if the demonstration of feasibility ultimately leads to future incorporation into an instrument capable of real-time QUS analysis for reliable nodule evaluation, then a highly significant technological advance will be realized that can provide valuable, risk-reducing, cost-effective health-care benefits for patients presenting with thyroid nodules.   PROJECT NARRATIVE: Thyroid cancer rates have tripled in the last thirty years, but current methods of diagnosis are very inefficient. Far too many thyroid biopsies and surgeries are performed with >80% of biopsies and >25% of thyroid surgeries being performed on benign nodules.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8996183,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,323753,-0.034461304910651296
"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it ha s the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. F indings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9337498,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'forest', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2017,658167,0.04456565634372793
"Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD Project Summary Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation and/or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Using several NIH and foundation grants, we have systematically generated genetic, genomics, proteomic, and metabolomics profiles from the NHLBI supported COPDGene cohort, which includes 10,300 current and former smokers age 45-80. This proposal will focus on integrating the omics data generated in the five-year followup (Phase II) of the COPDgene study to identify molecular subtypes of COPD across a broad range of blood profiles (Specific Aim 1). Biomarkers and pathways discriminating the molecular subtypes, in addition to other COPD phenotypes will then be identified (Specific Aim 2). These results will identify markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease and can be used to develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD. Relevance to Public Health Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. This proposal will use already collected data on existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9313961,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,563079,0.001660903885757671
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9199225,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enteral', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,171176,0.03417743060022286
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9180344,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoking', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2016,188040,0.08201771284885707
"Dose-distribution radiomics to predict morbidity risk in radiotherapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., and definitive radiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced, inoperable cases. Radiation therapy is also highly flexible, and can be adapted for variations in tumor volume and location. However, decision support models to optimize treatment planning and avoid morbidity on a patient-by-patient basis are lacking. Recently, the randomized phase III trial, RTOG 0617, compared high dose (74 Gy) treatments to standard (60 Gy) treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and demonstrated an unexpectedly higher rate of mortality in the high-dose arm. We hypothesize that this was primarily due to heart irradiation, in combination with lung irradiation factors. The goal of this project is to determine and validate predictive models of morbidity following thoracic RT, in order to achieve safer and more optimal tradeoffs between local control and morbidity. We will jointly analyze three large, high-quality datasets using innovative image-registration, machine learning, and dose characteristics (dose-based radiomics), to develop mathematical models that could be used to predict and avoid key morbidity endpoints in radiotherapy treatment planning. All endpoints will use dose-distribution comparison methods to examine the correlation between dose and morbidity as a function of anatomic location, thus providing greater assurance that the source of radiotherapy toxicity is correctly identified. Under Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will use innovative deformable image registration methods to map all patient dose distributions to a segmented reference case anatomy (including heart, lungs, bronchii, and blood vessels). The accuracy of the deformations will be mapped carefully using an innovative non-parametric estimation methodology. Tissue regions with high correlations to morbidity will be extracted for machine learning under SAs 2 and 3. Under SA2, we will apply innovative machine learning with the goal of relating dose factors extracted under SA1 with treatment-related death hazard. Under SA3, we will apply the same methodology to the risk of severe pneumonitis. We hypothesize that treatment related death hazard and radiation pneumonitis form a single predictable continuum of increasing risk, and we will attempt to bring together the results of SA2 and SA3 in a single predictive model. Innovative post-modeling analyses of mutually exclusive predictors will be used to make the machine learning models interpretable. The overall goals of this grant are: (1) to advance the state of science in the field of personally-optimized radiation oncology, and (2) to provide decision support tools to guide patient-specific tradeoffs between local control and toxicity in lung cancer radiotherapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lung cancer for locally advanced, inoperable disease is usually treated with radiotherapy, but the cause of severe treatment morbidity is not well understood.

Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9097781,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,352350,-0.0008647104035689531
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,-0.003842575021531535
"Tensor-based Dictionary Learning for Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a central concept in systems biomedicine, biomarkers are multi-scale, diverse, and inter-connected indicators of physiological and pathological states and activities. Over the past decade, the research in this area has been active and exciting, including imaging informatics based on imaging biomarkers. In this context, the genome-wide association studies are being performed to establish fundamental links between genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers but a prime challenge is that progress along this direction has been far from what was widely expected. A critical observation is that while data are exploding from genome sequencing and epigenetic analysis, in most cases medical image features are still subjective or only defined in classic fashions, which seems an unreasonable imbalance between genotypic and phenotypic worlds. Lung cancer screening is an emerging CT application and an opportunity to identify imaging biomarkers. Like other cancers, lung cancer is not one but many diseases. It is different in each patient and even in each tumor site with overwhelming nonlinearity and dynamics. It is crystal-clear that comprehensive, adaptive and individualized therapies are needed to win the battle against lung cancer. Being consistent to this big picture, research on sophisticated, instead of simplistic, biomarkers is not only helpful but also necessary in cancer research, and imaging informatics must perform exclusive and intelligent mining through rich in vivo imaging data for biomarkers so that correlative and predictive models could be established. The general hypothesis behind this R21 project is that new phenotypic information can be unlocked in tomographic data to improve sensitivity and specificity significantly in lung cancer CT screening. The overall goal of this project is to develp a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between CT lung screening results. The major innovation of this project is to synergistically integrate tensor decomposition, dictionary learning, compressive sensing, low-dose reconstruction, machine learning, locally linear embedding, super-computing and big data mining into a brand-new imaging informatics approach, which can be viewed as ""phenome sequencing"" in analog of genome sequencing. Upon the successful completion of this project, the identified imaging biomarkers will have been demonstrated instrumental in reducing the false positive rate significantly for lung CT scans while the false negative rate is kept constant.It will also help accurately stage lung cancers and non-invasively monitor cancer progression and therapeutic response. Equally important is the technical significance of this project. If it is established, a lasting impact will be generated on the field of imaging informatics at large. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between true/false positive/negative CT lung screening results.

"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,-0.0012372156533399232
"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9024612,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2016,166104,0.06313595840001916
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9164389,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2016,198612,0.020667569467013078
"Development of an Indicator Cell Assay for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are developing the Indicator Cell Assay Platform (iCAP), a broadly applicable and inexpensive blood- based assay that can be used for early detection of disease, disease stage stratification, prognosis and response to therapeutic intervention for a variety of diseases. The iCAP uses cultured cells as biosensors, capitalizing on the ability of cells to respond differently to signals present in the serum (or other biofluid) from normal or diseased subjects with exquisite sensitivity, as opposed to traditional assays that rely on direct detection of molecules in blood. Developing the iCAP involves exposing cultured cells to serum from normal or diseased subjects, measuring a global differential response pattern, and using it to build a reliable disease classifier comprised of a small number of features. Deploying the iCAP involves measuring only expression genes that are features of the disease classifier using cost-effective tools. Indicator cells are chosen based on the disease application, and those typically selected have known relationships to the disease pathology. The iCAP can overcome barriers to blood-based diagnostics like broad dynamic range of blood components, low abundance of specific markers, and high levels of noise. The focus of this proposal is to initiate development of the iCAP for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer (LC). Blood biomarkers of LC are desperately needed for use in combination with existing imaging tools to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our long-term goal is to develop a blood-based assay for clinical use on patients that have indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified by imaging to distinguish those with LC from those with benign nodules. This assay will help patients with benign nodules avoid invasive biopsy and focus further diagnostic tests on those with LC. For this Phase I study, we propose to develop an assay to reliably distinguish LC from benign nodules from patient serum samples. Specifically, we aim to 1) identify optimal indicator cells for the assay, 2) develop an iCAP-based classifier to reliably distinguish patients with lung cancer from those with benign nodules using patient serum, and 3) validate the assay by analyzing new serum samples. If we successfully achieve robust classification with >90% blind predictive accuracy and 70% sensitivity and specificity, the assay will be optimized and validated with larger cohorts in a Phase II study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a novel blood-based diagnostic tool called the indicator cell assay platform (iCAP) that uses cultured cells as biosensors to detect disease status of patients from blood samples. The iCAP will succeed where other methods have failed by exploiting cells' natural capability to amplify and integrate disease signals in blood. Here we will initiate development of an assay to robustly identify lung cancer in patients that have indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified by imaging to avoid invasive biopsy and focus further diagnostic test on those with lung cancer.            ",Development of an Indicator Cell Assay for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer,9048593,R43CA203455,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biosensor', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Lipids', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nodule', 'Noise', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'blind', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,"PRECYTE, INC.",R43,2016,299947,0.029912406930465176
"Clinical Evaluation of Lung Motion Tracker for Improved Diagnosis and Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In dynamic image-guided radiotherapy for lung cancer, one of the major tasks is to provide the dynamic images and tumor shapes that reflect the patient's real-time anatomy as the roadmap for guiding the delivery of radiation beams. One fundamental question for these applications is how to estimate such dynamic images, as well location and shape changes of tumor using available sensors to capture the respiratory motion. This proposal focuses on solving such a lung motion tracking problem by using our newly proposed high- dimensional surface to lung motion prediction model and considering the difference of each individuals, such as gender, size, and respiratory pattern. Specifically, we wil optimize the statistical models that capture the motion distribution from training samples and the nonlinear prediction model for accurate lung motion tracking and conduct extensive evaluation for the lung motion tracking system developed to validate its feasibility in clinic practice. Our goal is to develop an efficient, effective and robust lung motion tracking system for dynamic image guidance of the radiotherapy procedures. After this clinical data validation, such a technique can also be applied to image-guided intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung motion tracking is essential for dynamic image-guided radiotherapy for lung cancer. We propose to estimate the dynamic lung motion for patient using the high-dimensional chest surface motion. Due individual variability (patient size, gender, and different respiratory patterns), in this proposal, we will optimize the newly proposed lung motion tracking by considering practical patient variability and evaluate the performance of the proposed system with a large number of dataset collected from radiotherapy planning.",Clinical Evaluation of Lung Motion Tracker for Improved Diagnosis and Treatment,9050674,R03EB018977,"['Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Models', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Left', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'male', 'new technology', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'prediction algorithm', 'real time model', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'tumor']",NIBIB,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2016,79750,0.04902258614281772
"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it ha s the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. F indings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9176252,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Figs - dietary', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'forest', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2016,685363,0.04456565634372793
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9134892,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2016,563079,0.001660903885757671
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.        ",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9013900,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enteral', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2016,171176,0.03417743060022286
"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression. The information gained may form the basis of future prognostic/diagnostic schemes. We propose 2 Aims: Aim 1 Polarization resolved SHG to determine distribution of Col I/III and other ECM changes in different stages of IPF.  Aim 2.

"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1.             Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,8962812,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,352350,-0.0008647104035689531
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,-0.003842575021531535
"Tensor-based Dictionary Learning for Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a central concept in systems biomedicine, biomarkers are multi-scale, diverse, and inter-connected indicators of physiological and pathological states and activities. Over the past decade, the research in this area has been active and exciting, including imaging informatics based on imaging biomarkers. In this context, the genome-wide association studies are being performed to establish fundamental links between genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers but a prime challenge is that progress along this direction has been far from what was widely expected. A critical observation is that while data are exploding from genome sequencing and epigenetic analysis, in most cases medical image features are still subjective or only defined in classic fashions, which seems an unreasonable imbalance between genotypic and phenotypic worlds. Lung cancer screening is an emerging CT application and an opportunity to identify imaging biomarkers. Like other cancers, lung cancer is not one but many diseases. It is different in each patient and even in each tumor site with overwhelming nonlinearity and dynamics. It is crystal-clear that comprehensive, adaptive and individualized therapies are needed to win the battle against lung cancer. Being consistent to this big picture, research on sophisticated, instead of simplistic, biomarkers is not only helpful but also necessary in cancer research, and imaging informatics must perform exclusive and intelligent mining through rich in vivo imaging data for biomarkers so that correlative and predictive models could be established. The general hypothesis behind this R21 project is that new phenotypic information can be unlocked in tomographic data to improve sensitivity and specificity significantly in lung cancer CT screening. The overall goal of this project is to develp a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between CT lung screening results. The major innovation of this project is to synergistically integrate tensor decomposition, dictionary learning, compressive sensing, low-dose reconstruction, machine learning, locally linear embedding, super-computing and big data mining into a brand-new imaging informatics approach, which can be viewed as ""phenome sequencing"" in analog of genome sequencing. Upon the successful completion of this project, the identified imaging biomarkers will have been demonstrated instrumental in reducing the false positive rate significantly for lung CT scans while the false negative rate is kept constant.It will also help accurately stage lung cancers and non-invasively monitor cancer progression and therapeutic response. Equally important is the technical significance of this project. If it is established, a lasting impact will be generated on the field of imaging informatics at large.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop a tensor-based dictionary learning approach for extraction of CT imaging biomarkers, and optimize a tensor-based locally linear embedding to use these biomarkers for differentiation between true/false positive/negative CT lung screening results.

"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primarily due to the lack of physical symptoms in the early stage, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. Although high-resolution computed tomography (CT) has been proved to be a sensitive, non-invasive modality for visualizing small lung nodules, which could be the early manifestation of lung cancer, a considerable number of false positive detections are often resulted. Consequently, additional procedures, such as invasive biopsy / follow-up scans, are frequently needed to verify the nature of the indeterminate nodules. The negative effects associated with these over-diagnosis procedures, such as biopsy complications, exposure to additional radiation, patient anxiety, and economic cost, significantly limits the efficacy of CT screening for early diagnosis of lung cancer. In this project, we propose to develop a computer model to quantitatively assess the nature of indeterminate nodules using a longitudinal dataset. Unlike available investigations or lung cancer risk models, we will comprehensively quantify a wide variety of properties (features) of a nodule in an unprecedented detailed manner as well as their variations over time, and synergize them with patient demographic information (e.g., age, gender, smoke history) using machine learning techniques. Not only the image features of lung nodules but also their spatial relationship with respect to important lung landmarks as well as other smoke related lung abnormalities (e.g., emphysema) will be incorporated into this model. The output of this project, namely a novel computer tool, could aid clinicians to more accurately and efficiently assess the nature of indeterminate nodules, ultimately leading to the reduction of unnecessary harm and costs to patients and the healthcare system. All these will significantly improve the efficacy of CT for early lung cancer screening by maintaining its high sensitivity while reducing false positive findings. In terms of commercial potential, the developed tool could be easily integrated with the available image information systems at medical institutions by following the widely adopted Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a novel computer tool for aiding in accurate assessment of indeterminate nodules. Its novelty lies in the incorporation of a large variety of image features and patient demographic information using machine learning techniques and a longitudinal dataset. The availability of this tool would significantly improve th efficacy of CT by reducing false positive findings while maintaining its high sensitivity.            ",A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules,9043798,R43CA203058,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiation', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoke', 'Smoking History', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway remodeling', 'angiogenesis', 'calcification', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'economic cost', 'follow-up', 'image guided', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NCI,INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENT INFOR/SOLU/LAB,R43,2015,149970,0.08091110947456749
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.            ",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,8965166,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,911563,0.012197065989674814
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.            ",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,8860899,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2015,132192,0.06313595840001916
"RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite improvements in its diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high degree of mortality associated with this cancer, and the spectrum of different treatment options (which themselves involve significant morbidity), creates a difficult situation in which a patient is faced with critical, if not life-changing decisons. In an effort to make informed decisions, many turn to the Internet to find information on their disease. However, the quality of information is variable; the information can be difficult for the layperson to comprehend; and patients can have considerable problems understanding how the information they find is specifically applicable to their individual circumstances.            The objective of this proposal is the development of a framework, named RUMI (Retrieving Understandable Medical Information), which challenges how cancer patients receive information today by making the process of care explicit to the patient, providing access to his/her medical record data in the direct context of a clinical guideline so they can see how decisions are made. The first step in our effort is the development of a comprehensive lung cancer knowledge and process model (LCKPM) that captures a clinical guideline and workflow. The LCKPM provides a foundation for connecting the patient's medical record to decision points and actions that occur over time, detailing the criteria in making a selection and the supporting rationale. Different layers in the LCKPM organize information, which provide links: to public information resources helping explicate unfamiliar medical jargon and concepts; to questions (and answers) that are frequently fielded by healthcare providers managing lung cancer patients; and to more meaningful clinical episodes as experienced by the patient. Based on the LCKPM, RUMI automatically maps a patient's medical record: free-text documents are analyzed via information extraction (IE) and natural language processing (NLP) methods, identifying key concepts and variables (e.g., as used in decisions). In parallel, we examine public web resources that provide consumer-level explanations and discussions of lung cancer; these sites are deconstructed into curated knowledge segments that can be used in more directed presentations to a given individual. The knowledge segments are used to explain medical concepts within a patient's reports; and the terminology within the clinical guideline process flow. Collectively, these developments implement an individually-tailored web portal that visualizes the patient's personal experience over the disease trajectory using a simplified event-driven timeline. The portal also provides customized information regarding clinical trials that the individual is eligible for, and pertinent past trials results. In addition to technical evaluation, the RUMI framework will be evaluated through the UCLA Lung Cancer Program's outpatient clinics in a controlled study to assess end impact. The result of this project will be a set of approaches to employ patients' own medical records and public information resources to inform and empower lung cancer patients as participants in their own healthcare and medical decision-making processes. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  In spite of the improvements in early diagnostic and therapeutic methods, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In an effort to make informed decisions, these cancer patients frequently turn to the Internet to find information about their disease and potential treatment options; however, finding quality information is often problematic, the information is difficult to understand, and the relevance of the information to a patient�s own circumstances is often lost. The focus of this research is an informatics- based infrastructure to provide lung cancer patients with an automatically created, individually-tailored web portal that makes explicit their process of care, explaining decisions and choices using public information resources geared towards laypersons, thus better equipping users with the knowledge needed to make decisions.",RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information,8894597,R01LM011333,"['Accounting', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American Cancer Society', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Portal System', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'coping', 'design', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'information framework', 'interest', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'model development', 'mortality', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,324901,0.0277978600610542
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8808769,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,324063,-0.034461304910651296
"Clinical Evaluation of Lung Motion Tracker for Improved Diagnosis and Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In dynamic image-guided radiotherapy for lung cancer, one of the major tasks is to provide the dynamic images and tumor shapes that reflect the patient's real-time anatomy as the roadmap for guiding the delivery of radiation beams. One fundamental question for these applications is how to estimate such dynamic images, as well location and shape changes of tumor using available sensors to capture the respiratory motion. This proposal focuses on solving such a lung motion tracking problem by using our newly proposed high- dimensional surface to lung motion prediction model and considering the difference of each individuals, such as gender, size, and respiratory pattern. Specifically, we wil optimize the statistical models that capture the motion distribution from training samples and the nonlinear prediction model for accurate lung motion tracking and conduct extensive evaluation for the lung motion tracking system developed to validate its feasibility in clinic practice. Our goal is to develop an efficient, effective and robust lung motion tracking system for dynamic image guidance of the radiotherapy procedures. After this clinical data validation, such a technique can also be applied to image-guided intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung motion tracking is essential for dynamic image-guided radiotherapy for lung cancer. We propose to estimate the dynamic lung motion for patient using the high-dimensional chest surface motion. Due individual variability (patient size, gender, and different respiratory patterns), in this proposal, we will optimize the newly proposed lung motion tracking by considering practical patient variability and evaluate the performance of the proposed system with a large number of dataset collected from radiotherapy planning.            ",Clinical Evaluation of Lung Motion Tracker for Improved Diagnosis and Treatment,8893187,R03EB018977,"['Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Models', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Left', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical practice', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'male', 'new technology', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'tumor']",NIBIB,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2015,79750,0.04902258614281772
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.            ",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,8963132,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,593802,0.001660903885757671
"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression. The information gained may form the basis of future prognostic/diagnostic schemes. We propose 2 Aims: Aim 1 Polarization resolved SHG to determine distribution of Col I/III and other ECM changes in different stages of IPF.  Aim 2. Develop classification system of morphological changes in IPF visualized by SHG.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Narrative Idiopathic fibrosis (IPF) patients have poor survival rates and there is also a lack of diagnostic/prognostic tools that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to evaluate changes in collagen in the extracellular matrix. The methods developed here will improve upon these limitations and may lay the groundwork for eventual non- invasive in vivo imaging.            ",Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,8969087,R21HL126190,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collagen', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elastin', 'Equilibrium', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lung', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'base', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'public health relevance', 'second harmonic', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2015,218370,0.012353654795593952
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,-0.003842575021531535
"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                ",Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes,8580179,F32EY022558,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'EP300 gene', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer therapy', 'clinically relevant', 'directed attention', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lung cancer screening', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'vision science', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2014,36508,-0.06483047250851028
"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function.

"RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite improvements in its diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high degree of mortality associated with this cancer, and the spectrum of different treatment options (which themselves involve significant morbidity), creates a difficult situation in which a patient is faced with critical, if not life-changing decisons. In an effort to make informed decisions, many turn to the Internet to find information on their disease. However, the quality of information is variable; the information can be difficult for the layperson to comprehend; and patients can have considerable problems understanding how the information they find is specifically applicable to their individual circumstances.            The objective of this proposal is the development of a framework, named RUMI (Retrieving Understandable Medical Information), which challenges how cancer patients receive information today by making the process of care explicit to the patient, providing access to his/her medical record data in the direct context of a clinical guideline so they can see how decisions are made. The first step in our effort is the development of a comprehensive lung cancer knowledge and process model (LCKPM) that captures a clinical guideline and workflow. The LCKPM provides a foundation for connecting the patient's medical record to decision points and actions that occur over time, detailing the criteria in making a selection and the supporting rationale. Different layers in the LCKPM organize information, which provide links: to public information resources helping explicate unfamiliar medical jargon and concepts; to questions (and answers) that are frequently fielded by healthcare providers managing lung cancer patients; and to more meaningful clinical episodes as experienced by the patient. Based on the LCKPM, RUMI automatically maps a patient's medical record: free-text documents are analyzed via information extraction (IE) and natural language processing (NLP) methods, identifying key concepts and variables (e.g., as used in decisions). In parallel, we examine public web resources that provide consumer-level explanations and discussions of lung cancer; these sites are deconstructed into curated knowledge segments that can be used in more directed presentations to a given individual. The knowledge segments are used to explain medical concepts within a patient's reports; and the terminology within the clinical guideline process flow. Collectively, these developments implement an individually-tailored web portal that visualizes the patient's personal experience over the disease trajectory using a simplified event-driven timeline. The portal also provides customized information regarding clinical trials that the individual is eligible for, and pertinent past trials results. In addition to technical evaluation, the RUMI framework will be evaluated through the UCLA Lung Cancer Program's outpatient clinics in a controlled study to assess end impact. The result of this project will be a set of approaches to employ patients' own medical records and public information resources to inform and empower lung cancer patients as participants in their own healthcare and medical decision-making processes.             RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  In spite of the improvements in early diagnostic and therapeutic methods, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In an effort to make informed decisions, these cancer patients frequently turn to the Internet to find information about their disease and potential treatment options; however, finding quality information is often problematic, the information is difficult to understand, and the relevance of the information to a patient�s own circumstances is often lost. The focus of this research is an informatics- based infrastructure to provide lung cancer patients with an automatically created, individually-tailored web portal that makes explicit their process of care, explaining decisions and choices using public information resources geared towards laypersons, thus better equipping users with the knowledge needed to make decisions.",RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information,8662788,R01LM011333,"['Accounting', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American Cancer Society', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Portal System', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'coping', 'design', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'information framework', 'interest', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'model development', 'mortality', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2014,324902,0.0277978600610542
"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.          This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease. It will generate new experimental data for early detection of lung cancer, and has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer, a leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8660307,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,324364,-0.03476983482499008
"EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our broad long-term goal is to develop a convenient, non-invasive, clinically-used blood biomarker test that can distinguish patients with lung cancer from patients with benign nodules for the early detection of lung cancer.  Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over-diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening, which adds both to their psychological and to their financial burden. It is urgent to develop new non-invasive methods such as identifying blood molecular biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.  Our immediate objective for this proposal is to identify blood lipid markers for the early detection of lung cancer. Lipids have numerous critical biological functions which include membrane structure, energy storage, and signal transduction. Lipids have also been implicated as playing roles in several human diseases, including lung cancer. However, studies generally have been focused on total levels of lipids in a class. Because individual species of a lipid class may have different functions, it is essential to measure their compositions. In the proposed study, we will adopt lipidomics technology which aims to quantify a cell's lipidome, identifying and quantifying individual lipid molecular species on a large scale using mass spectrometry. Our preliminary studies with lung and prostate cancer indicate this technology is robust and promising. We have identified a lipid profile difference between non-lung cancer and lung cancer plasma samples. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing non-cancer and lung cancer samples are over 90%. Our hypothesis is that lipidomics profiles will be different between lung cancer and non-malignant cancer plasma samples including benign pulmonary lesions and we will be able to define a lipid list as a predictive signature of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) measure the levels of lipid species in human plasma from non-malignant and lung cancer biospecimens. 2) Mine lipid profile data to identify ""lipid markers"" that vary reproducibly between non-malignant samples and lung cancer samples. 3) Validate and test the predictive value of the lipid markers using independent samples.  Lipidomics is a rapidly developing novel technology that has not been applied to lung cancer studies. This work could lead to potentially new clinically used markers for early detection of lung cancer. Our findings may provide information that will lead to the development of novel lipid-related drugs to treat lung cancer. In the long term, linking our data with gene expression and proteomics data in lung cancer will give us a complete view of lipid metabolic pathways and networks, as well as new knowledge about their role in lung cancer development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to identify lipid biomarkers in human blood for the early detection of lung cancer using a new technology called lipidomics, which aims to measure all the lipids in a human body. We suppose the composition and amount of lipids in early-stage lung cancer patients are different from non-lung cancer patients. Based on this, we can distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over- diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening. Results from the proposed work will be of significant value to public health because we can eventually develop an invasive, accurate test tool to be clinically used for the early detection of lung cancer, which can save thousands of lives.            ",EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING,8617255,R21CA164764,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Hamartoma', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lecithin', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung nodule', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Non-Neoplastic Lung Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Sputum Cytology Screening', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'blood lipid', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'human disease', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'mass spectrometer', 'metabolomics', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2014,193675,0.08184013445727858
"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants. n/a",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),9172438,U01HL101456,[' '],NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",U01,2014,197560,0.035251275270938416
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,-0.003842575021531535
"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants.              n/a",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),8468005,U01HL101456,"['Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Amino Acids', 'Arginine', 'Aspirate substance', 'Beds', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'County Hospitals', 'Cysteine', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Erythrocytes', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Free Radicals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutathione', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Isoprostanes', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nutritional', 'Online Systems', 'Ornithine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrointestinal', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'oxidant stress', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'urea cycle']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2013,519792,0.035251275270938416
"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset. Finally we will incorporate these findings into an extended risk prediction model for lung cancer.",Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk,8506981,R01CA127219,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antihistamines', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Asbestos', 'Asthma', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Dust', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Haplotypes', 'Hay fever', 'Host Defense', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'International', 'Irritants', 'Joints', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical History', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer site', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'cell growth', 'chemical property', 'cigarette smoking', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,192450,0.0727673938200676
"RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite improvements in its diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high degree of mortality associated with this cancer, and the spectrum of different treatment options (which themselves involve significant morbidity), creates a difficult situation in which a patient is faced with critical, if not life-changing decisons. In an effort to make informed decisions, many turn to the Internet to find information on their disease. However, the quality of information is variable; the information can be difficult for the layperson to comprehend; and patients can have considerable problems understanding how the information they find is specifically applicable to their individual circumstances.            The objective of this proposal is the development of a framework, named RUMI (Retrieving Understandable Medical Information), which challenges how cancer patients receive information today by making the process of care explicit to the patient, providing access to his/her medical record data in the direct context of a clinical guideline so they can see how decisions are made. The first step in our effort is the development of a comprehensive lung cancer knowledge and process model (LCKPM) that captures a clinical guideline and workflow. The LCKPM provides a foundation for connecting the patient's medical record to decision points and actions that occur over time, detailing the criteria in making a selection and the supporting rationale. Different layers in the LCKPM organize information, which provide links: to public information resources helping explicate unfamiliar medical jargon and concepts; to questions (and answers) that are frequently fielded by healthcare providers managing lung cancer patients; and to more meaningful clinical episodes as experienced by the patient. Based on the LCKPM, RUMI automatically maps a patient's medical record: free-text documents are analyzed via information extraction (IE) and natural language processing (NLP) methods, identifying key concepts and variables (e.g., as used in decisions). In parallel, we examine public web resources that provide consumer-level explanations and discussions of lung cancer; these sites are deconstructed into curated knowledge segments that can be used in more directed presentations to a given individual. The knowledge segments are used to explain medical concepts within a patient's reports; and the terminology within the clinical guideline process flow. Collectively, these developments implement an individually-tailored web portal that visualizes the patient's personal experience over the disease trajectory using a simplified event-driven timeline. The portal also provides customized information regarding clinical trials that the individual is eligible for, and pertinent past trials results. In addition to technical evaluation, the RUMI framework will be evaluated through the UCLA Lung Cancer Program's outpatient clinics in a controlled study to assess end impact. The result of this project will be a set of approaches to employ patients' own medical records and public information resources to inform and empower lung cancer patients as participants in their own healthcare and medical decision-making processes.             RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  In spite of the improvements in early diagnostic and therapeutic methods, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In an effort to make informed decisions, these cancer patients frequently turn to the Internet to find information about their disease and potential treatment options; however, finding quality information is often problematic, the information is difficult to understand, and the relevance of the information to a patient�s own circumstances is often lost. The focus of this research is an informatics- based infrastructure to provide lung cancer patients with an automatically created, individually-tailored web portal that makes explicit their process of care, explaining decisions and choices using public information resources geared towards laypersons, thus better equipping users with the knowledge needed to make decisions.",RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information,8469083,R01LM011333,"['Accounting', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American Cancer Society', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Portal System', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'coping', 'design', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'information framework', 'interest', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'model development', 'mortality', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2013,304061,0.0277978600610542
"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.          This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease. It will generate new experimental data for early detection of lung cancer, and has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer, a leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8483561,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,324656,-0.03476983482499008
"EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our broad long-term goal is to develop a convenient, non-invasive, clinically-used blood biomarker test that can distinguish patients with lung cancer from patients with benign nodules for the early detection of lung cancer.  Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over-diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening, which adds both to their psychological and to their financial burden. It is urgent to develop new non-invasive methods such as identifying blood molecular biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.  Our immediate objective for this proposal is to identify blood lipid markers for the early detection of lung cancer. Lipids have numerous critical biological functions which include membrane structure, energy storage, and signal transduction. Lipids have also been implicated as playing roles in several human diseases, including lung cancer. However, studies generally have been focused on total levels of lipids in a class. Because individual species of a lipid class may have different functions, it is essential to measure their compositions. In the proposed study, we will adopt lipidomics technology which aims to quantify a cell's lipidome, identifying and quantifying individual lipid molecular species on a large scale using mass spectrometry. Our preliminary studies with lung and prostate cancer indicate this technology is robust and promising. We have identified a lipid profile difference between non-lung cancer and lung cancer plasma samples. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing non-cancer and lung cancer samples are over 90%. Our hypothesis is that lipidomics profiles will be different between lung cancer and non-malignant cancer plasma samples including benign pulmonary lesions and we will be able to define a lipid list as a predictive signature of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) measure the levels of lipid species in human plasma from non-malignant and lung cancer biospecimens. 2) Mine lipid profile data to identify ""lipid markers"" that vary reproducibly between non-malignant samples and lung cancer samples. 3) Validate and test the predictive value of the lipid markers using independent samples.  Lipidomics is a rapidly developing novel technology that has not been applied to lung cancer studies. This work could lead to potentially new clinically used markers for early detection of lung cancer. Our findings may provide information that will lead to the development of novel lipid-related drugs to treat lung cancer. In the long term, linking our data with gene expression and proteomics data in lung cancer will give us a complete view of lipid metabolic pathways and networks, as well as new knowledge about their role in lung cancer development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to identify lipid biomarkers in human blood for the early detection of lung cancer using a new technology called lipidomics, which aims to measure all the lipids in a human body. We suppose the composition and amount of lipids in early-stage lung cancer patients are different from non-lung cancer patients. Based on this, we can distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over- diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening. Results from the proposed work will be of significant value to public health because we can eventually develop an invasive, accurate test tool to be clinically used for the early detection of lung cancer, which can save thousands of lives.            ",EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING,8445920,R21CA164764,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Hamartoma', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lecithin', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung nodule', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Non-Neoplastic Lung Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Sputum Cytology Screening', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'blood lipid', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'human disease', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'mass spectrometer', 'metabolomics', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2013,166388,0.08184013445727858
"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.         There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.",Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease,8889317,U18NS082143,[' '],NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U18,2013,215807,0.003160432332969304
"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the Hispanic population is growing significantly which is of great concern. In Hispanics, the viral infection progresses more rapidly when compared with Caucasian patients and the treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Disturbingly, current treatments seem to be less effective on Hispanics. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabolomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from patients. We will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create our first order biomarker panels. In phase two, we will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). Dr. Spratt's research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve our SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer vs non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs. n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8308938,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2012,133197,-0.023379815198362658
"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.                  There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments.

"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                  Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function.

"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset. Finally we will incorporate these findings into an extended risk prediction model for lung cancer.",Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk,8442397,R01CA127219,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antihistamines', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Asbestos', 'Asthma', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Dust', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Haplotypes', 'Hay fever', 'Host Defense', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'International', 'Irritants', 'Joints', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical History', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer site', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'cell growth', 'chemical property', 'cigarette smoking', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2012,510315,0.0727673938200676
"RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite improvements in its diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high degree of mortality associated with this cancer, and the spectrum of different treatment options (which themselves involve significant morbidity), creates a difficult situation in which a patient is faced with critical, if not life-changing decisons. In an effort to make informed decisions, many turn to the Internet to find information on their disease. However, the quality of information is variable; the information can be difficult for the layperson to comprehend; and patients can have considerable problems understanding how the information they find is specifically applicable to their individual circumstances.            The objective of this proposal is the development of a framework, named RUMI (Retrieving Understandable Medical Information), which challenges how cancer patients receive information today by making the process of care explicit to the patient, providing access to his/her medical record data in the direct context of a clinical guideline so they can see how decisions are made. The first step in our effort is the development of a comprehensive lung cancer knowledge and process model (LCKPM) that captures a clinical guideline and workflow. The LCKPM provides a foundation for connecting the patient's medical record to decision points and actions that occur over time, detailing the criteria in making a selection and the supporting rationale. Different layers in the LCKPM organize information, which provide links: to public information resources helping explicate unfamiliar medical jargon and concepts; to questions (and answers) that are frequently fielded by healthcare providers managing lung cancer patients; and to more meaningful clinical episodes as experienced by the patient. Based on the LCKPM, RUMI automatically maps a patient's medical record: free-text documents are analyzed via information extraction (IE) and natural language processing (NLP) methods, identifying key concepts and variables (e.g., as used in decisions). In parallel, we examine public web resources that provide consumer-level explanations and discussions of lung cancer; these sites are deconstructed into curated knowledge segments that can be used in more directed presentations to a given individual. The knowledge segments are used to explain medical concepts within a patient's reports; and the terminology within the clinical guideline process flow. Collectively, these developments implement an individually-tailored web portal that visualizes the patient's personal experience over the disease trajectory using a simplified event-driven timeline. The portal also provides customized information regarding clinical trials that the individual is eligible for, and pertinent past trials results. In addition to technical evaluation, the RUMI framework will be evaluated through the UCLA Lung Cancer Program's outpatient clinics in a controlled study to assess end impact. The result of this project will be a set of approaches to employ patients' own medical records and public information resources to inform and empower lung cancer patients as participants in their own healthcare and medical decision-making processes.             RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  In spite of the improvements in early diagnostic and therapeutic methods, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In an effort to make informed decisions, these cancer patients frequently turn to the Internet to find information about their disease and potential treatment options; however, finding quality information is often problematic, the information is difficult to understand, and the relevance of the information to a patient�s own circumstances is often lost. The focus of this research is an informatics- based infrastructure to provide lung cancer patients with an automatically created, individually-tailored web portal that makes explicit their process of care, explaining decisions and choices using public information resources geared towards laypersons, thus better equipping users with the knowledge needed to make decisions.",RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information,8305921,R01LM011333,"['Accounting', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American Cancer Society', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Portal System', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'coping', 'design', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'information framework', 'interest', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'model development', 'mortality', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,332548,0.0277978600610542
"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease. It will generate new experimental data for early detection of lung cancer, and has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer, a leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.                  This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.           We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules.

"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset. Finally we will incorporate these findings into an extended risk prediction model for lung cancer.",Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk,8404111,R01CA127219,[' '],NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2011,348026,0.0727673938200676
"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm. (End of Abstract)      RELEVANCE: Each year in the US, more than 10,000 premature infants develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease associated with prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations and lifelong alterations in lung function. This proposal will explore developmental, genetic and environmental interactions and identify biochemical markers to predict BPD development and severity, with the ultimate goal of designing new treatments to prevent BPD and improve long-term lung function in premature infants.              n/a",Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV),7867527,U01HL101456,"['Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Amino Acids', 'Arginine', 'Aspirate substance', 'Beds', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'County Hospitals', 'Cysteine', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Erythrocytes', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Free Radicals', 'Gene Library', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutathione', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nutritional', 'Online Systems', 'Ornithine', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrointestinal', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'oxidant stress', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'urea cycle']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2010,227000,0.035251275270938416
"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility genes for lung cancer using a systematic genome- wide association-based approach. To achieve this goal, we are applying a two-stage design. This proposal builds upon an extensive resource of lung cancer cases and controls matched for smoking behavior, sex, and ethnicity who have been collected over many years at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and on a recently approved proposal to the Center for Inherited Disease Research that is performing genotyping of 317,000 markers on 1200 Caucasian ever-smoking lung cancer cases and 1200 controls matched for ethnicity, age, smoking behavior, and sex. Our first aim is to analyze data from the completed first-stage of genotyping. For our second aim, we will complete the two-stage design, which is powered to detect associations with genotypic risk ratios of about 1.4 with a very stringent significance criterion of 1.7 x 10-7. We will genotype and analyze 3380 SNPs on 1200 lung cancer cases and 1200 controls. We will also analyze SNPs from 90 candidate genes identified through a systematic literature search as well as a limited number of SNPs in significant pathways. In our third aim we will genotype 400 never-smoking lung cancer cases and 400 controls for 946 SNP markers. To evaluate possible interethnic differences in the genetic control of lung cancer risk we will analyze 400 African-American lung cancer cases and 400 African- American controls (aim 4) for 946 SNP markers. In these 4 aims we are also including a panel of SNPs to estimate ancestry. In aim 5, we use machine learning approaches to develop models for characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment effects on lung cancer risk. Cases and controls have extensive epidemiological and family history data together with candidate gene and functional DNA repair measures. The end result of our analysis will substantively increase our understanding of the genetic etiology of lung cancer and gene-environment interactions that contribute to its causation. This is an experienced investigative team, using state of the art technology to perform a multistage genome-wide analysis on a large, uniquely well-characterized population of lung cancer cases and matched controls with rich functional data. We are collaborating with the International Lung Cancer Consortium so that it can further validate our findings for a variety of different populations, in future initiatives.                                                              n/a",High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer,7858483,R01CA121197,"['African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotypic Risk Ratio', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Oncogenes', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Prevention', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Tobacco', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'novel', 'programs', 'repaired', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2010,386698,0.08687382059694532
"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset. Finally we will incorporate these findings into an extended risk prediction model for lung cancer.",Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk,7746494,R01CA127219,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antihistamines', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Asbestos', 'Asthma', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Dust', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Cancer History', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Haplotypes', 'Hay fever', 'Host Defense', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'International', 'Irritants', 'Joints', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical History', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer site', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'cell growth', 'chemical property', 'cigarette smoking', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2010,532744,0.0727673938200676
"Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to develop a non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The specific goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify urinary polypeptides that can be used as biomarkers of IgAN. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated elevated levels of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins and IgA-IgG complexes in the urine of IgAN patients using immune complex-specific ELISA. Furthermore, we have identified several potential urinary polypeptide biomarkers for IgAN by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and sequenced some of these polypeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the urine proteome of IgAN patients contains disease-specific biomarkers. We propose to test this hypothesis by first confirming our preliminary data through analysis of archival urine samples collected during studies of IgAN from well-characterized patients and controls. We will determine the levels of immunoglobulins and immune complexes using classical and immune complex-specific ELISA protocols with quality assurance and verification by western blot analysis. These data will then be extended by analysis using CE-MS to identify positive and negative biomarkers of disease in which the software tool, MosaCluster, with support vector machines, will be used for classification of samples. This approach will define a membership, with positive values (disease-associated marker) and negative values (marker for normal). The results of ELISA and CE-MS will be compared and correlated with the clinical findings. Candidate biomarkers identified by CE-MS will be further characterized by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS to define the amino acid sequence and post- translational modifications. Finally, candidate biomarkers will be verified using an independent cohort of patients and controls. This study is designed to identify markers that can be used to distinguish IgAN from other renal diseases as well as biomarkers of disease progression and severity. Relevance: IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently, diagnosis requires an invasive renal biopsy and IgAN is frequently diagnosed at a very late stage. The identification of biomarkers that can be used as the basis of a noninvasive diagnostic test and/or used to monitor the course of the disease would be extremely beneficial.       n/a",Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy,7896842,R21DK075868,"['Alabama', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Circulation', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Glycopeptides', 'Goals', 'IgA1', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Western Blotting', 'base', 'cohort', 'complement C3 precursor', 'design', 'glycosylation', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'molecular mass', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2010,183125,-0.025083103503548813
"Predicting Radiotherapy Outcomes by Combining Physical and Biological Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Many radiotherapy (RT) treatments carry a significant risk of serious complications to normal tissues. Previously, efforts to predict outcome have used either physical factors (e.g., volume irradiated to high dose) or biological factors (e.g., inherent radiosensitivity), but not both. We hypothesize that combining physical treatment data with patient-specific biomarkers will increase the predictive power of RT outcomes models. We will test this hypothesis specifically for prediction of radiation pneumonitis (RP) for lung cancer patients. Because no appropriate dataset exists to test this hypothesis, under Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective clinical trial for non-small-cell lung cancer patients and collect candidate physical and biological data for modeling. Biomarker families selected based on peer-reviewed literature will mainly include:  (a) the levels of DNA-end binding complexes of DNA damage detection and repair proteins, which has been well correlated with radiosensitivity; and (b) pretreatment blood levels of the interleukin family of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha and IL-6) and ACE enzymes, which have also been correlated to RP. Physical data to be collected includes volumes irradiated to varying doses of the normal lung (dose-volume histogram data, collected using 4-D methods to avoid breathing artifacts), and the spatial location of the high-dose regions, both of which have been correlated with risk of RP. We will also image tumor regression over the course of RT (mid-course and at the end of RT) in order to better characterize the high doses received by normal lung tissue after tumor regression. In SA2, we test the hypothesized improvement in outcome prediction by combining biological and physical data. To select the best mathematical model, we will adapt and validate a new form of statistical model-building known as kernel-based learning. Based on our preliminary results, the kernel-based methods will likely provide a natural framework for understanding the interactions among the different physical and biological variables resulting in an effectively optimal predictive model. In summary, we propose to test the combination of biological/biomarker data and dose data to improve our ability to predict radiotherapy complications. In particular, we will use detectable blood-based biomarkers as well as treatment dose distribution characteristics to potentially improve our ability to predict (or avoid) radiation pneumonitis.          n/a",Predicting Radiotherapy Outcomes by Combining Physical and Biological Factors,7787116,K25CA128809,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histology', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Theory', 'Interleukin-1 alpha', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Non-linear Models', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Pneumonitis', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Shorthand', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterilization', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'model design', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K25,2010,131547,0.02424525464013385
"Statistical Methods for Gene Environment Interactions In Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Lung cancer is among the best known examples of a disease that reflects the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. While carcinogenic compounds in tobacco smoke constitute the major risk factor for lung cancer, only about 14% of long-time smokers will develop cancer. Family studies indicate the role that genetic susceptibility plays in determining lung cancer risk. The goal of this research proposal is to develop and apply methods to identify genetic susceptibility factors for lung cancer that are modulated by the effects of tobacco smoke. Toward this goal we are taking advantage of two extensive sources of data that reflect the efforts of teams of scientists who have been devoted to understanding the causes of lung cancer. The first source of data is from the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium, which has been collecting extended families with three or more relatives affected with lung cancer since 2000. Analytical results show evidence for a genetic susceptibility factor on chromosome 6q that strongly increases lung cancer risk, but that has a much more profound effect on risk among tobacco smokers. The other major source of data is an extremely large, case-control study developed by Dr. Margaret Spitz at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, starting in 1993. Currently, candidate gene studies to identify genetic risk factors of lung cancer susceptibility have been completed for 51 polymorphisms. In addition, data from a newly launched initiative to perform a genome-wide association analysis of 1200 ever-smoking Caucasian lung cancer cases and 1200 matched controls will become available within the next 3 months. A major goal of this proposal is to develop simulation-based approaches to evaluate the efficacy of many competing analytical approaches for characterizing the role of gene-environment interactions in disease causation. Our research involves a strong analytical team with extensive experience in gene-environment modeling, application of machine learning tools, and the study of family data. In addition, we have unique skills and methods for simulating data, which will be further refined through the proposed research funding. The simulation approaches and analytical discoveries from our research will be widely distributed.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths. This research will develop an innovative computational system with implications for early detection of cancer as well as potential recurrence and metastasis, leading to increased survival rates.

"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7640849,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'design', 'disease classification', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,207225,-0.014611378463487786
"High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility genes for lung cancer using a systematic genome- wide association-based approach. To achieve this goal, we are applying a two-stage design. This proposal builds upon an extensive resource of lung cancer cases and controls matched for smoking behavior, sex, and ethnicity who have been collected over many years at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and on a recently approved proposal to the Center for Inherited Disease Research that is performing genotyping of 317,000 markers on 1200 Caucasian ever-smoking lung cancer cases and 1200 controls matched for ethnicity, age, smoking behavior, and sex. Our first aim is to analyze data from the completed first-stage of genotyping. For our second aim, we will complete the two-stage design, which is powered to detect associations with genotypic risk ratios of about 1.4 with a very stringent significance criterion of 1.7 x 10-7. We will genotype and analyze 3380 SNPs on 1200 lung cancer cases and 1200 controls. We will also analyze SNPs from 90 candidate genes identified through a systematic literature search as well as a limited number of SNPs in significant pathways. In our third aim we will genotype 400 never-smoking lung cancer cases and 400 controls for 946 SNP markers. To evaluate possible interethnic differences in the genetic control of lung cancer risk we will analyze 400 African-American lung cancer cases and 400 African- American controls (aim 4) for 946 SNP markers. In these 4 aims we are also including a panel of SNPs to estimate ancestry. In aim 5, we use machine learning approaches to develop models for characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment effects on lung cancer risk. Cases and controls have extensive epidemiological and family history data together with candidate gene and functional DNA repair measures. The end result of our analysis will substantively increase our understanding of the genetic etiology of lung cancer and gene-environment interactions that contribute to its causation. This is an experienced investigative team, using state of the art technology to perform a multistage genome-wide analysis on a large, uniquely well-characterized population of lung cancer cases and matched controls with rich functional data. We are collaborating with the International Lung Cancer Consortium so that it can further validate our findings for a variety of different populations, in future initiatives.                                                              n/a",High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer,7934247,R01CA121197,"['African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotypic Risk Ratio', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Oncogenes', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Prevention', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Tobacco', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'novel', 'programs', 'repaired', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,369994,0.08687382059694532

"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear. We propose to conduct an in depth analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway as susceptibility factors for lung cancer. This proposal builds upon an existing well annotated specimen repository. We will evaluate gene variants in a test set of lung cancer cases and matched controls and validate the findings in an independent dataset. Finally we will incorporate these findings into an extended risk prediction model for lung cancer.                      n/a",Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk,7536096,R01CA127219,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antihistamines', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Asbestos', 'Asthma', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Dust', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Cancer History', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Haplotypes', 'Hay fever', 'Host Defense', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'International', 'Irritants', 'Joints', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical History', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Progress Review Group', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer site', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'cell growth', 'chemical property', 'cigarette smoking', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,602949,0.0727673938200676
"Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to develop a non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The specific goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify urinary polypeptides that can be used as biomarkers of IgAN. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated elevated levels of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins and IgA-IgG complexes in the urine of IgAN patients using immune complex-specific ELISA. Furthermore, we have identified several potential urinary polypeptide biomarkers for IgAN by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and sequenced some of these polypeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the urine proteome of IgAN patients contains disease-specific biomarkers. We propose to test this hypothesis by first confirming our preliminary data through analysis of archival urine samples collected during studies of IgAN from well-characterized patients and controls. We will determine the levels of immunoglobulins and immune complexes using classical and immune complex-specific ELISA protocols with quality assurance and verification by western blot analysis. These data will then be extended by analysis using CE-MS to identify positive and negative biomarkers of disease in which the software tool, MosaCluster, with support vector machines, will be used for classification of samples. This approach will define a membership, with positive values (disease-associated marker) and negative values (marker for normal). The results of ELISA and CE-MS will be compared and correlated with the clinical findings. Candidate biomarkers identified by CE-MS will be further characterized by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS to define the amino acid sequence and post- translational modifications. Finally, candidate biomarkers will be verified using an independent cohort of patients and controls. This study is designed to identify markers that can be used to distinguish IgAN from other renal diseases as well as biomarkers of disease progression and severity. Relevance: IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently, diagnosis requires an invasive renal biopsy and IgAN is frequently diagnosed at a very late stage. The identification of biomarkers that can be used as the basis of a noninvasive diagnostic test and/or used to monitor the course of the disease would be extremely beneficial.       n/a",Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy,7386943,R21DK075868,"['Alabama', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Circulation', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Glycopeptides', 'Goals', 'IgA1', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Western Blotting', 'base', 'cohort', 'complement C3 precursor', 'design', 'glycosylation', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'molecular mass', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2009,219500,-0.025083103503548813
"Genetic Susceptibility for Lung Cancer in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among African-Americans and this population has approximately 1/3 higher risk than Caucasians. Recently, collaborative studies that we and others have lead have identified regions on chromosomes 15q25, 5p15 and 6p21 that are highly significantly associated with lung cancer risk in Caucasians. The regions of association on chromosome 15q and 6p lie in areas of the genome that show very strong levels of linkage disequilibrium in Caucasians so that identifying the specific causal gene and causal variant(s) is problematic. In African- Americans, our preliminary study of the region on chromosome 15q25 shows a much more punctate pattern of linkage disequilbrium so that studies of the African-American population will provide a more precise localization of genetic variants. The preliminary data suggest the role of multiple genetic factors, but our initial studies conducted with a limited number of samples and SNPs are not yet sufficient to identify precisely the location(s) of causal variants. Our preliminary data show stronger effects on risks from SNPs on chromosomes 5p and 15q in African-Americans than in Caucasians. We therefore propose to genotype samples from three centers comprising over 1300 lung cancer cases and 1300 controls for 400 SNP loci in each of the three regions of interest. We will also genotype ancestry informative markers so that we can evaluate the ancestral background as a confounder. The first aim will perform dense SNP analysis in three genomic regions to sublocalize and characterize the impact on lung cancer risk in three genomic regions. The second aim will perform more detailed modeling to estimate joint effects of smoking, sex and genetic factors on lung cancer risk. This analysis will allow us to identify groups of African-American individuals at particularly higher risks for developing lung cancer.           Narrative African-Americans have particularly high risks of developing lung cancer, but genetic factors that influence their risk have not yet been studied. The goal of this research is to confirm and extent observations that SNPs in 3 genomic regions that associate with lung cancer risk in Caucasians also associate with lung cancer risk in African-Americans. To study enough African-Americans with lung cancer we are combining data from three research sites: the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the University of California - San Francisco, and Karmanos Institute. The first aim of our proposal will test that these three regions associate with lung cancer risk and estimate the risk associated with SNPs in this region. We will study 400 single nucleotide polymorphisms (genetic markers) in each of the three regions to precisely localize which region of the genome is involved in influencing disease risk. The second aim will model the differential roles of sex, genetic factors, and smoking for these regions to delineate the impacts of these factors on risk and to identify specific subsets of individuals at highest risk for developing lung cancer.",Genetic Susceptibility for Lung Cancer in African Americans,7743910,R01CA141716,"['15q', '15q24', '15q25', '6p21', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Cisplatin', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Death Rate', 'Dependence', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Ethnic group', 'Funding', 'Gender Role', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Survival Rate', 'TERT gene', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco smoking', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'parent grant', 'sex', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,397997,0.06518696669960085
"Predicting Radiotherapy Outcomes by Combining Physical and Biological Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Many radiotherapy (RT) treatments carry a significant risk of serious complications to normal tissues. Previously, efforts to predict outcome have used either physical factors (e.g., volume irradiated to high dose) or biological factors (e.g., inherent radiosensitivity), but not both. We hypothesize that combining physical treatment data with patient-specific biomarkers will increase the predictive power of RT outcomes models. We will test this hypothesis specifically for prediction of radiation pneumonitis (RP) for lung cancer patients. Because no appropriate dataset exists to test this hypothesis, under Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective clinical trial for non-small-cell lung cancer patients and collect candidate physical and biological data for modeling. Biomarker families selected based on peer-reviewed literature will mainly include:  (a) the levels of DNA-end binding complexes of DNA damage detection and repair proteins, which has been well correlated with radiosensitivity; and (b) pretreatment blood levels of the interleukin family of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha and IL-6) and ACE enzymes, which have also been correlated to RP. Physical data to be collected includes volumes irradiated to varying doses of the normal lung (dose-volume histogram data, collected using 4-D methods to avoid breathing artifacts), and the spatial location of the high-dose regions, both of which have been correlated with risk of RP. We will also image tumor regression over the course of RT (mid-course and at the end of RT) in order to better characterize the high doses received by normal lung tissue after tumor regression. In SA2, we test the hypothesized improvement in outcome prediction by combining biological and physical data. To select the best mathematical model, we will adapt and validate a new form of statistical model-building known as kernel-based learning. Based on our preliminary results, the kernel-based methods will likely provide a natural framework for understanding the interactions among the different physical and biological variables resulting in an effectively optimal predictive model. In summary, we propose to test the combination of biological/biomarker data and dose data to improve our ability to predict radiotherapy complications. In particular, we will use detectable blood-based biomarkers as well as treatment dose distribution characteristics to potentially improve our ability to predict (or avoid) radiation pneumonitis.          n/a",Predicting Radiotherapy Outcomes by Combining Physical and Biological Factors,7622168,K25CA128809,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dose', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Family', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histology', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Theory', 'Interleukin-1 alpha', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Non-linear Models', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Pneumonitis', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Shorthand', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Tumor stage', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'model design', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'repaired', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K25,2009,131547,0.02424525464013385
"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7367013,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,77600,0.021481559919425564
"Statistical Methods for Gene Environment Interactions In Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Lung cancer is among the best known examples of a disease that reflects the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. While carcinogenic compounds in tobacco smoke constitute the major risk factor for lung cancer, only about 14% of long-time smokers will develop cancer. Family studies indicate the role that genetic susceptibility plays in determining lung cancer risk. The goal of this research proposal is to develop and apply methods to identify genetic susceptibility factors for lung cancer that are modulated by the effects of tobacco smoke. Toward this goal we are taking advantage of two extensive sources of data that reflect the efforts of teams of scientists who have been devoted to understanding the causes of lung cancer. The first source of data is from the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium, which has been collecting extended families with three or more relatives affected with lung cancer since 2000. Analytical results show evidence for a genetic susceptibility factor on chromosome 6q that strongly increases lung cancer risk, but that has a much more profound effect on risk among tobacco smokers. The other major source of data is an extremely large, case-control study developed by Dr. Margaret Spitz at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, starting in 1993. Currently, candidate gene studies to identify genetic risk factors of lung cancer susceptibility have been completed for 51 polymorphisms. In addition, data from a newly launched initiative to perform a genome-wide association analysis of 1200 ever-smoking Caucasian lung cancer cases and 1200 matched controls will become available within the next 3 months. A major goal of this proposal is to develop simulation-based approaches to evaluate the efficacy of many competing analytical approaches for characterizing the role of gene-environment interactions in disease causation. Our research involves a strong analytical team with extensive experience in gene-environment modeling, application of machine learning tools, and the study of family data. In addition, we have unique skills and methods for simulating data, which will be further refined through the proposed research funding. The simulation approaches and analytical discoveries from our research will be widely distributed.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

"Genetic Polymorphisms in TRAIL Pathway as Susceptibility Markers for Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Eighty-seven percent of lung cancers (LC) are attributed to tobacco exposure. However, only a fraction of smokers develop cancer. Genetically determined modulation of environmental exposures is an attractive possible mechanism for the variation in host susceptibility. Loss of apoptosis has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism for lung carcinogenesis. The activation of apoptosis signaling is through an intrinsic Bcl- 2 pathway and an extrinsic or TRAIL (TNF-related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) pathway by activation of the death receptor. Although apoptosis is evolutionarily conserved, there may be interindividual variation in apoptotic capacity in general population. Polymorphic changes on genes of TRAIL pathway have been reported to be associated with modulated apoptosis. To date, there have been no studies on the role of genetic polymorphisms in the apoptotic pathway genes as predisposing factors for LC. In this application, we aim at examining polymorphisms in genes involved in the TRAIL pathway as predisposition factor for LC. The specific aims of this proposed study are: 1) To assess frequencies of SNPs in genes in the TRAIL apoptotic pathway (DR4, DR5, FADD, caspases -8, -10, -3, and -9, and BID) in 1000 cases and 1000 controls. Our working hypothesis is that adverse alleles on TRAIL pathway genes which are associated with modified apoptosis capacity may predispose individuals to increased lung cancer risk; 2) To Assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional genetic factors; 3) To apply hierarchical model to refine the risk assessment and to apply novel machine- learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Our hypothesis is that LC is a complex disease involving multiple genes in the apoptic pathway that have common, low penetrance polymorphisms, and that these polymorphisms interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. This application is designed to build upon a data and specimen repository from on ongoing funded lung-cancer case- control study in the Department of Epidemiology.

"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7531854,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'design', 'desire', 'disease classification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,172688,-0.014611378463487786
"High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility genes for lung cancer using a systematic genome- wide association-based approach. To achieve this goal, we are applying a two-stage design. This proposal builds upon an extensive resource of lung cancer cases and controls matched for smoking behavior, sex, and ethnicity who have been collected over many years at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and on a recently approved proposal to the Center for Inherited Disease Research that is performing genotyping of 317,000 markers on 1200 Caucasian ever-smoking lung cancer cases and 1200 controls matched for ethnicity, age, smoking behavior, and sex. Our first aim is to analyze data from the completed first-stage of genotyping. For our second aim, we will complete the two-stage design, which is powered to detect associations with genotypic risk ratios of about 1.4 with a very stringent significance criterion of 1.7 x 10-7. We will genotype and analyze 3380 SNPs on 1200 lung cancer cases and 1200 controls. We will also analyze SNPs from 90 candidate genes identified through a systematic literature search as well as a limited number of SNPs in significant pathways. In our third aim we will genotype 400 never-smoking lung cancer cases and 400 controls for 946 SNP markers. To evaluate possible interethnic differences in the genetic control of lung cancer risk we will analyze 400 African-American lung cancer cases and 400 African- American controls (aim 4) for 946 SNP markers. In these 4 aims we are also including a panel of SNPs to estimate ancestry. In aim 5, we use machine learning approaches to develop models for characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment effects on lung cancer risk. Cases and controls have extensive epidemiological and family history data together with candidate gene and functional DNA repair measures. The end result of our analysis will substantively increase our understanding of the genetic etiology of lung cancer and gene-environment interactions that contribute to its causation. This is an experienced investigative team, using state of the art technology to perform a multistage genome-wide analysis on a large, uniquely well-characterized population of lung cancer cases and matched controls with rich functional data. We are collaborating with the International Lung Cancer Consortium so that it can further validate our findings for a variety of different populations, in future initiatives.                                                              n/a",High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer,7458843,R01CA121197,"['African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Causations', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotypic Risk Ratio', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Numbers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Oncogenes', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Prevention', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Tobacco', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'programs', 'repaired', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2008,563540,0.08687382059694532
"Inflammation Genes and Lung Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that chronic injury and inflammation in the respiratory tract, such as that caused by cigarette smoking, predispose to lung cancer. We therefore propose to conduct an in depth pathway-based analysis of gene variants in the inflammatory pathway using test and validation sets of cases and controls. This proposal builds on a well-annotated specimen repository of lung cancer cases and controls enrolled in an ongoing risk factor study (CA55769, Spitz, PI). Cases are frequency-matched to controls on age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status recruited from a multi-specialty physician practice. Data collected include smoking history, dietary intake, cancer family history, specific occupational exposures (e.g., asbestos, dust), and previous medical history including chronic obstructive airway disease, asthma and hay fever. Genomic DNA and rich candidate genotype and phenotype data are available. Aim 1: To identify novel genetic variants influencing lung cancer risk in a test set of 1500 cases with non-small cell lung cancer and 1500 matched controls (all Caucasian), using the Illumina iSelect Infinium chip with 8.5 to 9K SNP's. Aim 2: In a replication set of an additional 1000 cases and 1000 controls, using a GoldenGate assay, we will evaluate the top 1500 SNPs identified from Aim1 as meeting the P<0.1 criterion, or selected by a rational prioritizing approach that incorporates published results, type of SNP, evolutionary biology, physico-chemical properties and haplotype tagging SNPs. Aim 3: To perform fine mapping in the flanking regions of 50 SNPs selected by the same approach as in Aim 2, combining prior information with in silico approaches for predicting functionality. For each of these 50 SNPs, we will select an average of 10 additional SNPs per gene region to regenotype in all 2500 cases and 2500 controls. Aim 4. To extend our epidemiologic risk prediction model by incorporating established epidemiologic risk factor and gene variant data. We will apply machine-learning tools to identify gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Covariates will include prior emphysema, asthma, hay fever, dust and asbestos exposure, smoking characteristics, family history of cancer, and anti-inflammatory drug use. The International Lung Cancer Consortium will perform external validation in a proposal to be developed. Our approach to comprehensively evaluate variants in a candidate pathway in a large well- powered study will be applicable to a variety of other cancer sites where inflammation plays an important etiologic role, as well as in non-neoplastic diseases with a strong inflammatory component such as emphysema. The public health potential of a useful risk prediction modes for lung cancer is substantial. Public Health Relevance Statement Cigarette smoking results in inflammation in the respiratory tract and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammatory processes predispose to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causal nature of this association are unclear.

"Predicting Radiotherapy Outcomes by Combining Physical and Biological Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Many radiotherapy (RT) treatments carry a significant risk of serious complications to normal tissues. Previously, efforts to predict outcome have used either physical factors (e.g., volume irradiated to high dose) or biological factors (e.g., inherent radiosensitivity), but not both. We hypothesize that combining physical treatment data with patient-specific biomarkers will increase the predictive power of RT outcomes models. We will test this hypothesis specifically for prediction of radiation pneumonitis (RP) for lung cancer patients. Because no appropriate dataset exists to test this hypothesis, under Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective clinical trial for non-small-cell lung cancer patients and collect candidate physical and biological data for modeling. Biomarker families selected based on peer-reviewed literature will mainly include:  (a) the levels of DNA-end binding complexes of DNA damage detection and repair proteins, which has been well correlated with radiosensitivity; and (b) pretreatment blood levels of the interleukin family of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha and IL-6) and ACE enzymes, which have also been correlated to RP. Physical data to be collected includes volumes irradiated to varying doses of the normal lung (dose-volume histogram data, collected using 4-D methods to avoid breathing artifacts), and the spatial location of the high-dose regions, both of which have been correlated with risk of RP. We will also image tumor regression over the course of RT (mid-course and at the end of RT) in order to better characterize the high doses received by normal lung tissue after tumor regression. In SA2, we test the hypothesized improvement in outcome prediction by combining biological and physical data. To select the best mathematical model, we will adapt and validate a new form of statistical model-building known as kernel-based learning. Based on our preliminary results, the kernel-based methods will likely provide a natural framework for understanding the interactions among the different physical and biological variables resulting in an effectively optimal predictive model. In summary, we propose to test the combination of biological/biomarker data and dose data to improve our ability to predict radiotherapy complications. In particular, we will use detectable blood-based biomarkers as well as treatment dose distribution characteristics to potentially improve our ability to predict (or avoid) radiation pneumonitis.          n/a",Predicting Radiotherapy Outcomes by Combining Physical and Biological Factors,7470386,K25CA128809,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Damage', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'End Point', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histology', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Theory', 'Interleukin-1 alpha', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Non-linear Models', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Numbers', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Pneumonitis', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Shorthand', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterilization for infection control', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Week', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'model design', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'response', 'size', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K25,2008,131547,0.02424525464013385
"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7265522,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,77600,0.021481559919425564
"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility. The goals of this project are to (i) automate our prototype serum peptide profiling platform and implement machine learning methods that use the resulting peptide patterns ('barcodes') for sample classification [R21]; and (ii) to test the 'barcode diagnostic' model in a high-throughput setting, using well defined and carefully observed groups of thyroid carcinoma patients [R33]. R21 aim one is to automate serum sample processing and analysis; aim two is to automate all data processing, to examine pattern selection and sample class prediction methods, and to integrate all software platforms; aim three is to develop routine MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS sequencing of 'barcode' peptides. R33 aim one is to define reproducibility of serum patterns in patients with  thyroid disease; aim two is to determine barcodes that can distinguish patients with thyroid cancer from those with benign thyroid nodules; aim three is to assess if serum peptidome barcodes can identify occult metastasis in a large group of thyroid cancer survivors.         n/a",Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma,7259406,R33CA111942,"['Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Goals', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Diseases', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'concept', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'prototype', 'sample collection']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RES,R33,2007,307752,-0.011769053658247722
"Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The applicant describes a five year program leading to independent translational research related to pulmonary and critical care medicine.  Although trained as a neuroscientist, the investigator is motivated by clinical experience to propose a career dedicated to the development of molecular diagnostic and targeted therapeutic approaches to medicine, in particular to lung cancer and critical illness.  Practical skills in functional genomics, proteomics, molecular biology, biostatistics, and machine learning will be fostered in the laboratory of Dr. Todd Golub, himself an accomplished clinical scientist with a vital independent research program.  Director of Cancer Genomics at the Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research, Dr. Golub is a pioneer and internationally recognized leader in the application of genomics approaches to cancer biology, especially classification and prognosis.  This immersion will be complemented by formal instruction in genomics and computational biology, and reinforced by active advising from a team of domain experts.        The proposed research plan starts from the tenet that delayed or inaccurate diagnoses can be lethal.  Most lung cancer patients present with advanced disease, when the prognosis is grave; many of the critically ill can be given no better than phenomenological descriptions of their disease.  The Human Genome Project and other developments in biology and technology have advanced unbiased, whole-genome discovery efforts for improved markers of disease.  The principal investigator will undertake such an effort, by 1) creating datasets by mass spectrometry from serum samples of lung cancer patients and controls; 2) defining signatures of disease using machine learning approaches; and 3) identifying proteins and peptides comprising the diagnostic signatures.  While the investigator hopes to develop functional lung cancer biomarkers, the methodologies are intended to be applicable throughout medicine.        The combined resources of the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the Whitehead Institute will be available to the applicant.  These rich environments will promote the success of the serum biomarker discovery project, and the larger cultivation of the investigator towards a goal of independence and productivity in academic medicine. n/a",Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer,7251530,K08CA102159,"['Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinogenesis Mechanism', 'Carcinogens', 'Cessation of life', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development, Other', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'General Hospitals', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Limited Stage', 'Localized', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oligonucleotide Microarrays', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Small Cell Carcinoma', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'cancer classification', 'cancer genomics', 'career', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'lung carcinogenesis', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'success', 'survivorship', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2007,135837,0.03331457882415026
"Statistical Methods for Gene Environment Interactions In Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Lung cancer is among the best known examples of a disease that reflects the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. While carcinogenic compounds in tobacco smoke constitute the major risk factor for lung cancer, only about 14% of long-time smokers will develop cancer. Family studies indicate the role that genetic susceptibility plays in determining lung cancer risk. The goal of this research proposal is to develop and apply methods to identify genetic susceptibility factors for lung cancer that are modulated by the effects of tobacco smoke. Toward this goal we are taking advantage of two extensive sources of data that reflect the efforts of teams of scientists who have been devoted to understanding the causes of lung cancer. The first source of data is from the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium, which has been collecting extended families with three or more relatives affected with lung cancer since 2000. Analytical results show evidence for a genetic susceptibility factor on chromosome 6q that strongly increases lung cancer risk, but that has a much more profound effect on risk among tobacco smokers. The other major source of data is an extremely large, case-control study developed by Dr. Margaret Spitz at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, starting in 1993. Currently, candidate gene studies to identify genetic risk factors of lung cancer susceptibility have been completed for 51 polymorphisms. In addition, data from a newly launched initiative to perform a genome-wide association analysis of 1200 ever-smoking Caucasian lung cancer cases and 1200 matched controls will become available within the next 3 months. A major goal of this proposal is to develop simulation-based approaches to evaluate the efficacy of many competing analytical approaches for characterizing the role of gene-environment interactions in disease causation. Our research involves a strong analytical team with extensive experience in gene-environment modeling, application of machine learning tools, and the study of family data. In addition, we have unique skills and methods for simulating data, which will be further refined through the proposed research funding. The simulation approaches and analytical discoveries from our research will be widely distributed.

"Genetic Polymorphisms in TRAIL Pathway as Susceptibility Markers for Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Eighty-seven percent of lung cancers (LC) are attributed to tobacco exposure. However, only a fraction of smokers develop cancer. Genetically determined modulation of environmental exposures is an attractive possible mechanism for the variation in host susceptibility. Loss of apoptosis has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism for lung carcinogenesis. The activation of apoptosis signaling is through an intrinsic Bcl- 2 pathway and an extrinsic or TRAIL (TNF-related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) pathway by activation of the death receptor. Although apoptosis is evolutionarily conserved, there may be interindividual variation in apoptotic capacity in general population. Polymorphic changes on genes of TRAIL pathway have been reported to be associated with modulated apoptosis. To date, there have been no studies on the role of genetic polymorphisms in the apoptotic pathway genes as predisposing factors for LC. In this application, we aim at examining polymorphisms in genes involved in the TRAIL pathway as predisposition factor for LC. The specific aims of this proposed study are: 1) To assess frequencies of SNPs in genes in the TRAIL apoptotic pathway (DR4, DR5, FADD, caspases -8, -10, -3, and -9, and BID) in 1000 cases and 1000 controls. Our working hypothesis is that adverse alleles on TRAIL pathway genes which are associated with modified apoptosis capacity may predispose individuals to increased lung cancer risk; 2) To Assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional genetic factors; 3) To apply hierarchical model to refine the risk assessment and to apply novel machine- learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Our hypothesis is that LC is a complex disease involving multiple genes in the apoptic pathway that have common, low penetrance polymorphisms, and that these polymorphisms interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. This application is designed to build upon a data and specimen repository from on ongoing funded lung-cancer case- control study in the Department of Epidemiology. Because relevant genotype data and epidemiologic profiles are available from the parent grant, this application is both time and cost effective. The goal of this study is to further our understanding of lung carcinogenesis. Polymorphic changes on TRAIL pathway may be useful risk biomarkers to identify high-risk populations.           n/a",Genetic Polymorphisms in TRAIL Pathway as Susceptibility Markers for Lung Cancer,7264915,R03CA128079,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Applications Grants', 'Asbestos', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Build-it', 'CD95 Antigens', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Death Domain', 'Disease', 'Dust', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family Cancer History', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Hay fever', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Metabolic', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Population', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand', 'TNFRSF10B gene', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'caspase-8', 'cost effective', 'death receptor-4', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'human TNFRSF10A protein', 'lung carcinogenesis', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'receptor', 'repository', 'smoking cessation', 'telomere', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UT MD ANDERSON CANCER CTR,R03,2007,77000,0.03055262603669617
"High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility genes for lung cancer using a systematic genome- wide association-based approach. To achieve this goal, we are applying a two-stage design. This proposal builds upon an extensive resource of lung cancer cases and controls matched for smoking behavior, sex, and ethnicity who have been collected over many years at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and on a recently approved proposal to the Center for Inherited Disease Research that is performing genotyping of 317,000 markers on 1200 Caucasian ever-smoking lung cancer cases and 1200 controls matched for ethnicity, age, smoking behavior, and sex. Our first aim is to analyze data from the completed first-stage of genotyping. For our second aim, we will complete the two-stage design, which is powered to detect associations with genotypic risk ratios of about 1.4 with a very stringent significance criterion of 1.7 x 10-7. We will genotype and analyze 3380 SNPs on 1200 lung cancer cases and 1200 controls. We will also analyze SNPs from 90 candidate genes identified through a systematic literature search as well as a limited number of SNPs in significant pathways. In our third aim we will genotype 400 never-smoking lung cancer cases and 400 controls for 946 SNP markers. To evaluate possible interethnic differences in the genetic control of lung cancer risk we will analyze 400 African-American lung cancer cases and 400 African- American controls (aim 4) for 946 SNP markers. In these 4 aims we are also including a panel of SNPs to estimate ancestry. In aim 5, we use machine learning approaches to develop models for characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment effects on lung cancer risk. Cases and controls have extensive epidemiological and family history data together with candidate gene and functional DNA repair measures. The end result of our analysis will substantively increase our understanding of the genetic etiology of lung cancer and gene-environment interactions that contribute to its causation. This is an experienced investigative team, using state of the art technology to perform a multistage genome-wide analysis on a large, uniquely well-characterized population of lung cancer cases and matched controls with rich functional data. We are collaborating with the International Lung Cancer Consortium so that it can further validate our findings for a variety of different populations, in future initiatives.                                                              n/a",High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer,7321441,R01CA121197,"['African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Causations', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dietary intake', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Family Cancer History', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotypic Risk Ratio', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Numbers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Oncogenes', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Smoking Prevention', 'Smoking Status', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Tobacco', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'programs', 'repaired', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UT MD ANDERSON CANCER CTR,R01,2007,584700,0.08687382059694532
"Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis. Our goal is to develop methods to translate gene expression profiles into knowledge that will lead to the identification of molecular targets for prediction and therapy in these patients.

Our primary hypothesis is: Clinical and gene expression attributes combine in rule-based models to accurately predict patient outcomes (time to death or recurrence). We propose to test this hypothesis for patients with resectable NSCLC. The Specific Aims are to: 1. Test the accuracy of the rule-based models as a function of the data type. We will use several established algorithms for generating decision rule models. Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) will be used to evaluate model accuracy, complexity, and stability.

Our goal is to develop methods to translate gene expression profiles into knowledge that will lead to the identification of molecular targets for prediction and therapy in these patients.

"Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer      deaths in both men and women. A 70 percent five-year survival rate has been          reported when the lung cancer is diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 2           percent when distant metastases are found. Recent studies indicate that helical      CT may be an effective screening tool for lung cancer. The American College of       Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) will begin a randomized controlled trial of        helical CT for lung cancer screening to evaluate its efficacy. Analysis of CT        images to detect lung nodules is a demanding task for radiologists. Some lung        nodules will likely be overlooked because of the overwhelming amount of              information to be interpreted. Characterization of detected nodules to reduce        unnecessary biopsies will also become more important as the number of thoracic       CT exams increases. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to       improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection in CT images. It      will be particularly useful if lung cancer screening with CT is implemented.                                                                                              The goal of the proposed project is to develop a CAD system for early detection      of lung cancers on thoracic helical CT images. We hypothesize that an accurate       CAD system (1) can be developed, (2) can be used as a second opinion to assist       radiologists in interpretation of thoracic CT exams, and (3) will improve            radiologists' accuracy for lung cancer detection.                                                                                                                         We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to automatically segment         helical CT images, detect candidate pulmonary nodules, differentiate nodule and      normal pulmonary structures, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of the        nodules. Computerized image segmentation and feature extraction techniques will      be developed based on expert knowledge and image characteristics. Statistical        classifiers, fuzzy classifiers, and artificial neural networks will be designed      to differentiate nodules and normal structures, as well as to characterize           malignant and benign nodules. Quantitative CT phantom studies will be performed      to develop reliable methods for estimating the calcium concentration of nodules      and estimating nodule volume on CT images so that these features can be used in      our CAD system for malignancy detection. Observer performance studies using          receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology will be conducted to             evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection and classification of         lung nodules in CT images. A large public database of helical CT cases to be         collected by an NIH-supported consortium will be the main data source for the        development of the computer vision techniques. The innovations of this project       include: (1) developing region-specific computer vision method for detection of      lung nodules; (2) eliminating the vascular tree in the helium for false              positive reduction, (3) exploring interval change analysis for classification        of malignant and benign nodules; (4) developing a quantitative method for            measuring the calcium concentration of nodules for improved characterization of      calcified nodules, and (5) performing ROC studies to evaluate CAD's ability to       assist radiologists in the detection and characterization of lung nodules in CT      studies. It is expected that the proposed studies will result in an effective        CAD system for lung cancer diagnosis. When fully developed and clinically            implemented, a CAD system for lung nodules will increase the efficacy of lung        cancer screening with helical CT, improve early detection, and improve the           chance of survival of patients.                                                                                                                                           n/a",Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,6994449,R01CA093517,"['calcification', 'calcium', 'calcium disorder', 'clinical research', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'lung neoplasms', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2006,363111,0.053382337643028306
"Analysis of Ethnic Admixture in Lung Cancer                                  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a five-year plan       developed for a Cancer Prevention, Control, Behavioral and Population Sciences       Career Development Award.  It outlines a program that integrates education,          teaching and research to develop my skills in statistical genetics, molecular        biology, cancer biology, human genetics and genetic epidemiology.  My research       plan consists of two projects: (l) higher level genetic modeling of early            onset lung cancer cases and controls with admixture versus ethnicity as a            covariate and (2) application of an admixture, population substructure and           disequilibria testing procedure to early onset lung cancer cases,                    population-based controls and nuclear families.                                                                                                                           Project l uses data from a funded study on early onset lung cancer of                African-Americans and Caucasians.  Nine candidate loci believed to be involved       in lung cancer risk along with 35 population specific markers (PSAs) for             Africans and Europeans combined, are being typed for each case and a matched         population and familial control.  An admixture algorithm will be written,            programmed and tested on cases, controls and parents to estimate individual          and population admixture, using the PSAs.  Logistic regression models and            decision tree models (classification and regression tree) will be compared           when modeling the genotypes of the candidate loci and other collected                environmental/descriptive variables, in order to assess the difference between       using an ethnicity variable versus an individual admixture estimate variable.                                                                                             Project 2 will build on the already developed admixture estimation algorithm         (Project l).  I will develop a complete procedure that will estimate                 individual and population admixture and within population substructure and           will test for induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) and Hardy-Weinberg                 disequilibrium (HWD), for all cases, controls and nuclear families.  This            procedure will be tested in a computer-based simulation, using the early onset       lung cancer data as a model, in order to estimate the statistical power and          test characteristics such as false-positive and false-negative rates.  Linkage       disequilibrium mapping will also be performed on the study data.                                                                                                          Both of these projects will address epidemiological study design issues about        ethnicity and using population-based versus familial based controls.  From the       studies proposed, a recommendation could be made on how to utilize individual        admixture information in the choice of controls for epidemiological studies.         These projects will give me experience in developing methodology in                  statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology, while also helping me to better       understand etiology of disease.                                                                                                                                                                           n/a",Analysis of Ethnic Admixture in Lung Cancer,7008230,K07CA091849,"['African American', 'caucasian American', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder onset', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic models', 'genetic susceptibility', 'human subject', 'lung neoplasms', 'model design /development', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NCI,H.

"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility. The goals of this project are to (i) automate our prototype serum peptide profiling platform and implement machine learning methods that use the resulting peptide patterns ('barcodes') for sample classification [R21]; and (ii) to test the 'barcode diagnostic' model in a high-throughput setting, using well defined and carefully observed groups of thyroid carcinoma patients [R33]. R21 aim one is to automate serum sample processing and analysis; aim two is to automate all data processing, to examine pattern selection and sample class prediction methods, and to integrate all software platforms; aim three is to develop routine MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS sequencing of 'barcode' peptides. R33 aim one is to define reproducibility of serum patterns in patients with  thyroid disease; aim two is to determine barcodes that can distinguish patients with thyroid cancer from those with benign thyroid nodules; aim three is to assess if serum peptidome barcodes can identify occult metastasis in a large group of thyroid cancer survivors.         n/a",Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma,7225803,R33CA111942,"['automated data processing', 'biomarker', 'biotechnology', 'blood proteins', 'carcinoma', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'high throughput technology', 'human tissue', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'protein sequence', 'proteomics', 'robotics', 'thyroid neoplasm']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RES,R33,2006,319027,-0.011769053658247722

"Principled Methods for Very Large-Scale Causal Discovery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to develop, validate and apply methods for very large-scale principled causal discovery that scale up to massive datasets such as the ones found in bioinformatics, electronic patient records, and bibliographic systems. The explosive proliferation and growth (in sample, variables, and quality) of such datasets creates tremendous opportunities for biomedical discoveries, hence powerful methods for causal discovery have the potential to revolutionize biomedicine.        To address this problem of scale, the co-PIs have developed several novel causal discovery algorithms with well-defined properties and guarantees that employ a principled local approach: these algorithms focus only on the local causal neighborhood (e.g. direct causes and effects or, alternatively, Markov Blanket) of a single or several ""target"" variable(s), and they are built on a formal framework for representing and learning causality. A plethora of preliminary experiments with simulated and real data suggest that the algorithms are sound and highly scalable.      The local algorithms, by their assumptions, are expected to have applicability to a broad application  context that includes bioinformatics, epidemiology, text analysis, and clinical medicine. The proposed  research intends to take two focused steps in this broad application space. The local algorithms will be applied to (a) gene expression data from patients with lung cancer and (b) data from a large epidemiologic analysis of factors that influence development of breast cancer in patients with non-invasive breast disease. It is hypothesized that novel and potentially significant new causal relationships will be discovered. This hypothesis bears great biomedical and methodological significance. The specific aims are to (i) validate the novel causal algorithms; (ii) induce novel hypotheses about the immediate causes and effects of a selected group of genes implicated in lung cancer; (iii) induce novel causal hypotheses about the causes of breast cancer; (iv) compare the performance of the novel local algorithms to state-of-the-art alternatives; (v) disseminate new and powerful causal discovery tools. The methods to evaluate the novel causal algorithms and the hypotheses generated by them are: (a) validation against existing knowledge using structured,  evidence-based, blinded literature review by domain experts; (b) selective experimentation in cell lines (lung cancer domain), and (c) statistical performance metrics. n/a",Principled Methods for Very Large-Scale Causal Discovery,6930544,R01LM007948,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomedical automation', 'breast neoplasms', 'cell line', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'disease /disorder model', 'gene expression', 'health science research', 'human data', 'information systems', 'lung neoplasms', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'western blottings']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,199320,-0.013973207279803617

We hypothesize that an accurate       CAD system (1) can be developed, (2) can be used as a second opinion to assist       radiologists in interpretation of thoracic CT exams, and (3) will improve            radiologists' accuracy for lung cancer detection.                                                                                                                         We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to automatically segment         helical CT images, detect candidate pulmonary nodules, differentiate nodule and      normal pulmonary structures, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of the        nodules. Computerized image segmentation and feature extraction techniques will      be developed based on expert knowledge and image characteristics. Statistical        classifiers, fuzzy classifiers, and artificial neural networks will be designed      to differentiate nodules and normal structures, as well as to characterize           malignant and benign nodules. Quantitative CT phantom studies will be performed      to develop reliable methods for estimating the calcium concentration of nodules      and estimating nodule volume on CT images so that these features can be used in      our CAD system for malignancy detection. Observer performance studies using          receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology will be conducted to             evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection and classification of         lung nodules in CT images. A large public database of helical CT cases to be         collected by an NIH-supported consortium will be the main data source for the        development of the computer vision techniques. The innovations of this project       include: (1) developing region-specific computer vision method for detection of      lung nodules; (2) eliminating the vascular tree in the helium for false              positive reduction, (3) exploring interval change analysis for classification        of malignant and benign nodules; (4) developing a quantitative method for            measuring the calcium concentration of nodules for improved characterization of      calcified nodules, and (5) performing ROC studies to evaluate CAD's ability to       assist radiologists in the detection and characterization of lung nodules in CT      studies. It is expected that the proposed studies will result in an effective        CAD system for lung cancer diagnosis. When fully developed and clinically            implemented, a CAD system for lung nodules will increase the efficacy of lung        cancer screening with helical CT, improve early detection, and improve the           chance of survival of patients.                                                                                                                                           n/a",Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,6831634,R01CA093517,"['calcification', 'calcium', 'calcium disorder', 'clinical research', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'lung neoplasms', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2005,377144,0.053382337643028306
"Analysis of Ethnic Admixture in Lung Cancer                                  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a five-year plan       developed for a Cancer Prevention, Control, Behavioral and Population Sciences       Career Development Award.  It outlines a program that integrates education,          teaching and research to develop my skills in statistical genetics, molecular        biology, cancer biology, human genetics and genetic epidemiology.  My research       plan consists of two projects: (l) higher level genetic modeling of early            onset lung cancer cases and controls with admixture versus ethnicity as a            covariate and (2) application of an admixture, population substructure and           disequilibria testing procedure to early onset lung cancer cases,                    population-based controls and nuclear families.                                                                                                                           Project l uses data from a funded study on early onset lung cancer of                African-Americans and Caucasians.  Nine candidate loci believed to be involved       in lung cancer risk along with 35 population specific markers (PSAs) for             Africans and Europeans combined, are being typed for each case and a matched         population and familial control.  An admixture algorithm will be written,            programmed and tested on cases, controls and parents to estimate individual          and population admixture, using the PSAs.  Logistic regression models and            decision tree models (classification and regression tree) will be compared           when modeling the genotypes of the candidate loci and other collected                environmental/descriptive variables, in order to assess the difference between       using an ethnicity variable versus an individual admixture estimate variable.                                                                                             Project 2 will build on the already developed admixture estimation algorithm         (Project l).  I will develop a complete procedure that will estimate                 individual and population admixture and within population substructure and           will test for induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) and Hardy-Weinberg                 disequilibrium (HWD), for all cases, controls and nuclear families.  This            procedure will be tested in a computer-based simulation, using the early onset       lung cancer data as a model, in order to estimate the statistical power and          test characteristics such as false-positive and false-negative rates.  Linkage       disequilibrium mapping will also be performed on the study data.                                                                                                          Both of these projects will address epidemiological study design issues about        ethnicity and using population-based versus familial based controls.  From the       studies proposed, a recommendation could be made on how to utilize individual        admixture information in the choice of controls for epidemiological studies.

"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility. The goals of this project are to (i) automate our prototype serum peptide profiling platform and implement machine learning methods that use the resulting peptide patterns ('barcodes') for sample classification [R21]; and (ii) to test the 'barcode diagnostic' model in a high-throughput setting, using well defined and carefully observed groups of thyroid carcinoma patients [R33]. R21 aim one is to automate serum sample processing and analysis; aim two is to automate all data processing, to examine pattern selection and sample class prediction methods, and to integrate all software platforms; aim three is to develop routine MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS sequencing of 'barcode' peptides. R33 aim one is to define reproducibility of serum patterns in patients with  thyroid disease; aim two is to determine barcodes that can distinguish patients with thyroid cancer from those with benign thyroid nodules; aim three is to assess if serum peptidome barcodes can identify occult metastasis in a large group of thyroid cancer survivors.         n/a",Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma,6859786,R21CA111942,"['automated data processing', 'biomarker', 'biotechnology', 'blood proteins', 'carcinoma', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'high throughput technology', 'human tissue', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'protein sequence', 'proteomics', 'robotics', 'thyroid neoplasm']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RES,R21,2005,143964,-0.011769053658247722
"Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis. Our goal is to develop methods to translate gene expression profiles into knowledge that will lead to the identification of molecular targets for prediction and therapy in these patients. Current clinical (staging) models for prediction of survival in these patients with small, localized tumors (Stage I) fails to identify the subset that will die less than 2.5 years after ""curative"" surgery. Our preliminary research with rule-based models using Stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients demonstrates meaningful results for prediction of survival with models that combine gene expression data with clinical data. Our primary hypothesis is: Clinical and gene expression attributes combine in rule-based models to accurately predict patient outcomes (time to death or recurrence). We propose to test this hypothesis for patients with resectable NSCLC. The Specific Aims are to: 1. Test the accuracy of the rule-based models as a function of the data type. We will use several established algorithms for generating decision rule models. Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) will be used to evaluate model accuracy, complexity, and stability. The ""gold standard"" for performance comparison is the AJCC staging model. 2. Compare the model performance for rule-based induction to other algorithms. We will use support vector machines and artificial neural networks. We will address the role of feature selection in model performance. We will also confirm the significance of model variables using a standard statistical metric, partial least squares. We will also experimentally evaluate (random and adaptive) subsampling methods (bagging and boosting, respectively), which vote multiple rule models produced by one rule-based system, C4.5. 3. Research rule induction to hypothesize causal mechanisms in survival. We will develop a novel extension to rule induction that we call backward-chaining rule induction, a form of ""semi-supervised"" learning, which we expect to better focus the search for variable interactions to ""interesting"" rules (i.e., those with mechanistic explanations), than purely unsupervised approaches. Knowledge discovery will be evaluated based on domain expertise in the molecular basis of cancer. n/a",Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes,6778604,R01LM008000,"['artificial intelligence', 'biopsy', 'clinical research', 'gene expression profiling', 'human subject', 'mathematical model', 'microarray technology', 'model design /development', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nonsmall cell lung cancer', 'outcomes research', 'patient oriented research', 'prognosis', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,208380,0.023112065246546295
"Principled Methods for Very Large-Scale Causal Discovery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to develop, validate and apply methods for very large-scale principled causal discovery that scale up to massive datasets such as the ones found in bioinformatics, electronic patient records, and bibliographic systems. The explosive proliferation and growth (in sample, variables, and quality) of such datasets creates tremendous opportunities for biomedical discoveries, hence powerful methods for causal discovery have the potential to revolutionize biomedicine.        To address this problem of scale, the co-PIs have developed several novel causal discovery algorithms with well-defined properties and guarantees that employ a principled local approach: these algorithms focus only on the local causal neighborhood (e.g. direct causes and effects or, alternatively, Markov Blanket) of a single or several ""target"" variable(s), and they are built on a formal framework for representing and learning causality. A plethora of preliminary experiments with simulated and real data suggest that the algorithms are sound and highly scalable.      The local algorithms, by their assumptions, are expected to have applicability to a broad application  context that includes bioinformatics, epidemiology, text analysis, and clinical medicine. The proposed  research intends to take two focused steps in this broad application space. The local algorithms will be applied to (a) gene expression data from patients with lung cancer and (b) data from a large epidemiologic analysis of factors that influence development of breast cancer in patients with non-invasive breast disease. It is hypothesized that novel and potentially significant new causal relationships will be discovered. This hypothesis bears great biomedical and methodological significance. The specific aims are to (i) validate the novel causal algorithms; (ii) induce novel hypotheses about the immediate causes and effects of a selected group of genes implicated in lung cancer; (iii) induce novel causal hypotheses about the causes of breast cancer; (iv) compare the performance of the novel local algorithms to state-of-the-art alternatives; (v) disseminate new and powerful causal discovery tools. The methods to evaluate the novel causal algorithms and the hypotheses generated by them are: (a) validation against existing knowledge using structured,  evidence-based, blinded literature review by domain experts; (b) selective experimentation in cell lines (lung cancer domain), and (c) statistical performance metrics. n/a",Principled Methods for Very Large-Scale Causal Discovery,6784073,R01LM007948,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomedical automation', 'breast neoplasms', 'cell line', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'disease /disorder model', 'gene expression', 'health science research', 'human data', 'information systems', 'lung neoplasms', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'western blottings']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,232540,-0.013973207279803617
"Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The applicant describes a five year program leading to independent translational research related to pulmonary and critical care medicine.  Although trained as a neuroscientist, the investigator is motivated by clinical experience to propose a career dedicated to the development of molecular diagnostic and targeted therapeutic approaches to medicine, in particular to lung cancer and critical illness.  Practical skills in functional genomics, proteomics, molecular biology, biostatistics, and machine learning will be fostered in the laboratory of Dr. Todd Golub, himself an accomplished clinical scientist with a vital independent research program.  Director of Cancer Genomics at the Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research, Dr. Golub is a pioneer and internationally recognized leader in the application of genomics approaches to cancer biology, especially classification and prognosis.  This immersion will be complemented by formal instruction in genomics and computational biology, and reinforced by active advising from a team of domain experts.        The proposed research plan starts from the tenet that delayed or inaccurate diagnoses can be lethal.  Most lung cancer patients present with advanced disease, when the prognosis is grave; many of the critically ill can be given no better than phenomenological descriptions of their disease.  The Human Genome Project and other developments in biology and technology have advanced unbiased, whole-genome discovery efforts for improved markers of disease.  The principal investigator will undertake such an effort, by 1) creating datasets by mass spectrometry from serum samples of lung cancer patients and controls; 2) defining signatures of disease using machine learning approaches; and 3) identifying proteins and peptides comprising the diagnostic signatures.  While the investigator hopes to develop functional lung cancer biomarkers, the methodologies are intended to be applicable throughout medicine.        The combined resources of the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the Whitehead Institute will be available to the applicant.  These rich environments will promote the success of the serum biomarker discovery project, and the larger cultivation of the investigator towards a goal of independence and productivity in academic medicine. n/a",Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer,6771670,K08CA102159,"['adenocarcinoma', 'biomarker', 'chromatography', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'functional /structural genomics', 'human tissue', 'information systems', 'lung neoplasms', 'mass spectrometry', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'proteomics', 'serum', 'small cell lung cancer', 'squamous cell carcinoma']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,K08,2004,135837,0.03331457882415026
"Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer      deaths in both men and women. A 70 percent five-year survival rate has been          reported when the lung cancer is diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 2           percent when distant metastases are found. Recent studies indicate that helical      CT may be an effective screening tool for lung cancer. The American College of       Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) will begin a randomized controlled trial of        helical CT for lung cancer screening to evaluate its efficacy. Analysis of CT        images to detect lung nodules is a demanding task for radiologists. Some lung        nodules will likely be overlooked because of the overwhelming amount of              information to be interpreted. Characterization of detected nodules to reduce        unnecessary biopsies will also become more important as the number of thoracic       CT exams increases. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to       improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection in CT images. It      will be particularly useful if lung cancer screening with CT is implemented.

"Analysis of Ethnic Admixture in Lung Cancer                                  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a five-year plan       developed for a Cancer Prevention, Control, Behavioral and Population Sciences       Career Development Award.  It outlines a program that integrates education,          teaching and research to develop my skills in statistical genetics, molecular        biology, cancer biology, human genetics and genetic epidemiology.  My research       plan consists of two projects: (l) higher level genetic modeling of early            onset lung cancer cases and controls with admixture versus ethnicity as a            covariate and (2) application of an admixture, population substructure and           disequilibria testing procedure to early onset lung cancer cases,                    population-based controls and nuclear families.                                                                                                                           Project l uses data from a funded study on early onset lung cancer of                African-Americans and Caucasians.  Nine candidate loci believed to be involved       in lung cancer risk along with 35 population specific markers (PSAs) for             Africans and Europeans combined, are being typed for each case and a matched         population and familial control.  An admixture algorithm will be written,            programmed and tested on cases, controls and parents to estimate individual          and population admixture, using the PSAs.  Logistic regression models and            decision tree models (classification and regression tree) will be compared           when modeling the genotypes of the candidate loci and other collected                environmental/descriptive variables, in order to assess the difference between       using an ethnicity variable versus an individual admixture estimate variable.                                                                                             Project 2 will build on the already developed admixture estimation algorithm         (Project l).  I will develop a complete procedure that will estimate                 individual and population admixture and within population substructure and           will test for induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) and Hardy-Weinberg                 disequilibrium (HWD), for all cases, controls and nuclear families.  This            procedure will be tested in a computer-based simulation, using the early onset       lung cancer data as a model, in order to estimate the statistical power and          test characteristics such as false-positive and false-negative rates.  Linkage       disequilibrium mapping will also be performed on the study data.                                                                                                          Both of these projects will address epidemiological study design issues about        ethnicity and using population-based versus familial based controls.  From the       studies proposed, a recommendation could be made on how to utilize individual        admixture information in the choice of controls for epidemiological studies.

"Principled Methods for Very Large-Scale Causal Discovery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to develop, validate and apply methods for very large-scale principled causal discovery that scale up to massive datasets such as the ones found in bioinformatics, electronic patient records, and bibliographic systems. The explosive proliferation and growth (in sample, variables, and quality) of such datasets creates tremendous opportunities for biomedical discoveries, hence powerful methods for causal discovery have the potential to revolutionize biomedicine.        To address this problem of scale, the co-PIs have developed several novel causal discovery algorithms with well-defined properties and guarantees that employ a principled local approach: these algorithms focus only on the local causal neighborhood (e.g. direct causes and effects or, alternatively, Markov Blanket) of a single or several ""target"" variable(s), and they are built on a formal framework for representing and learning causality. A plethora of preliminary experiments with simulated and real data suggest that the algorithms are sound and highly scalable.      The local algorithms, by their assumptions, are expected to have applicability to a broad application  context that includes bioinformatics, epidemiology, text analysis, and clinical medicine. The proposed  research intends to take two focused steps in this broad application space. The local algorithms will be applied to (a) gene expression data from patients with lung cancer and (b) data from a large epidemiologic analysis of factors that influence development of breast cancer in patients with non-invasive breast disease. It is hypothesized that novel and potentially significant new causal relationships will be discovered. This hypothesis bears great biomedical and methodological significance. The specific aims are to (i) validate the novel causal algorithms; (ii) induce novel hypotheses about the immediate causes and effects of a selected group of genes implicated in lung cancer; (iii) induce novel causal hypotheses about the causes of breast cancer; (iv) compare the performance of the novel local algorithms to state-of-the-art alternatives; (v) disseminate new and powerful causal discovery tools. The methods to evaluate the novel causal algorithms and the hypotheses generated by them are: (a) validation against existing knowledge using structured,  evidence-based, blinded literature review by domain experts; (b) selective experimentation in cell lines (lung cancer domain), and (c) statistical performance metrics. n/a",Principled Methods for Very Large-Scale Causal Discovery,6670333,R01LM007948,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' breast neoplasms', ' cell line', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' disease /disorder model', ' gene expression', ' health science research', ' human data', ' information systems', ' lung neoplasms', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' method development', ' microarray technology', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' western blottings']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,199320,-0.013973207279803617
"Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The applicant describes a five year program leading to independent translational research related to pulmonary and critical care medicine.  Although trained as a neuroscientist, the investigator is motivated by clinical experience to propose a career dedicated to the development of molecular diagnostic and targeted therapeutic approaches to medicine, in particular to lung cancer and critical illness.  Practical skills in functional genomics, proteomics, molecular biology, biostatistics, and machine learning will be fostered in the laboratory of Dr. Todd Golub, himself an accomplished clinical scientist with a vital independent research program.  Director of Cancer Genomics at the Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research, Dr. Golub is a pioneer and internationally recognized leader in the application of genomics approaches to cancer biology, especially classification and prognosis.  This immersion will be complemented by formal instruction in genomics and computational biology, and reinforced by active advising from a team of domain experts.        The proposed research plan starts from the tenet that delayed or inaccurate diagnoses can be lethal.  Most lung cancer patients present with advanced disease, when the prognosis is grave; many of the critically ill can be given no better than phenomenological descriptions of their disease.  The Human Genome Project and other developments in biology and technology have advanced unbiased, whole-genome discovery efforts for improved markers of disease.  The principal investigator will undertake such an effort, by 1) creating datasets by mass spectrometry from serum samples of lung cancer patients and controls; 2) defining signatures of disease using machine learning approaches; and 3) identifying proteins and peptides comprising the diagnostic signatures.  While the investigator hopes to develop functional lung cancer biomarkers, the methodologies are intended to be applicable throughout medicine.        The combined resources of the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the Whitehead Institute will be available to the applicant.  These rich environments will promote the success of the serum biomarker discovery project, and the larger cultivation of the investigator towards a goal of independence and productivity in academic medicine. n/a",Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer,6673550,K08CA102159,"['adenocarcinoma', ' biomarker', ' chromatography', ' clinical research', ' functional /structural genomics', ' human tissue', ' information systems', ' lung neoplasms', ' mass spectrometry', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein structure function', ' proteomics', ' serum', ' small cell lung cancer', ' squamous cell carcinoma']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,K08,2003,135837,0.03331457882415026
"Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer      deaths in both men and women. A 70 percent five-year survival rate has been          reported when the lung cancer is diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 2           percent when distant metastases are found. Recent studies indicate that helical      CT may be an effective screening tool for lung cancer. The American College of       Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) will begin a randomized controlled trial of        helical CT for lung cancer screening to evaluate its efficacy. Analysis of CT        images to detect lung nodules is a demanding task for radiologists. Some lung        nodules will likely be overlooked because of the overwhelming amount of              information to be interpreted. Characterization of detected nodules to reduce        unnecessary biopsies will also become more important as the number of thoracic       CT exams increases. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to       improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection in CT images. It      will be particularly useful if lung cancer screening with CT is implemented.                                                                                              The goal of the proposed project is to develop a CAD system for early detection      of lung cancers on thoracic helical CT images. We hypothesize that an accurate       CAD system (1) can be developed, (2) can be used as a second opinion to assist       radiologists in interpretation of thoracic CT exams, and (3) will improve            radiologists' accuracy for lung cancer detection.                                                                                                                         We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to automatically segment         helical CT images, detect candidate pulmonary nodules, differentiate nodule and      normal pulmonary structures, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of the        nodules. Computerized image segmentation and feature extraction techniques will      be developed based on expert knowledge and image characteristics. Statistical        classifiers, fuzzy classifiers, and artificial neural networks will be designed      to differentiate nodules and normal structures, as well as to characterize           malignant and benign nodules. Quantitative CT phantom studies will be performed      to develop reliable methods for estimating the calcium concentration of nodules      and estimating nodule volume on CT images so that these features can be used in      our CAD system for malignancy detection. Observer performance studies using          receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology will be conducted to             evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection and classification of         lung nodules in CT images. A large public database of helical CT cases to be         collected by an NIH-supported consortium will be the main data source for the        development of the computer vision techniques. The innovations of this project       include: (1) developing region-specific computer vision method for detection of      lung nodules; (2) eliminating the vascular tree in the helium for false              positive reduction, (3) exploring interval change analysis for classification        of malignant and benign nodules; (4) developing a quantitative method for            measuring the calcium concentration of nodules for improved characterization of      calcified nodules, and (5) performing ROC studies to evaluate CAD's ability to       assist radiologists in the detection and characterization of lung nodules in CT      studies. It is expected that the proposed studies will result in an effective        CAD system for lung cancer diagnosis. When fully developed and clinically            implemented, a CAD system for lung nodules will increase the efficacy of lung        cancer screening with helical CT, improve early detection, and improve the           chance of survival of patients.                                                                                                                                           n/a",Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,6620518,R01CA093517,"['calcification', ' calcium', ' calcium disorder', ' clinical research', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2003,363825,0.053382337643028306

Logistic regression models and            decision tree models (classification and regression tree) will be compared           when modeling the genotypes of the candidate loci and other collected                environmental/descriptive variables, in order to assess the difference between       using an ethnicity variable versus an individual admixture estimate variable.

I will develop a complete procedure that will estimate                 individual and population admixture and within population substructure and           will test for induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) and Hardy-Weinberg                 disequilibrium (HWD), for all cases, controls and nuclear families.  This            procedure will be tested in a computer-based simulation, using the early onset       lung cancer data as a model, in order to estimate the statistical power and          test characteristics such as false-positive and false-negative rates.  Linkage       disequilibrium mapping will also be performed on the study data.                                                                                                          Both of these projects will address epidemiological study design issues about        ethnicity and using population-based versus familial based controls.  From the       studies proposed, a recommendation could be made on how to utilize individual        admixture information in the choice of controls for epidemiological studies.

"AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinson’s Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects more than 7 million people worldwide, and biomarkers to bolster the therapeutic pipeline are urgently needed. Developing biomarkers for clinical use is a difficult process that requires evaluation of multiple, large cohorts, each adding confidence to the marker. The Accelerating Medicine Partnership in Parkinson’s disease (AMP PD) consortium provides an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly achieve this previously elusive goal.  We hypothesize that a powerful, multi-omics classifier powered by standard and advanced machine learning algorithms will accurately identify PD-associated biomarkers at genome scale. Transcripts and genomic classifiers associated with PD will be identified in early-stage, untreated, patients with Dopamine Transporter- neuroimaging-supported diagnosis represented in the PPMI cohort. Transcripts and genomic classifiers will be rigorously replicated in the independent PDBP and BioFIND cohorts. Multi-omics classifiers using both PD- associated transcriptome changes and PD-associated genomic variants will be built with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g. variational autoencoder).  This analysis will powerfully delineate --- for the first time --- the full spectrum of known and novel, coding and noncoding RNAs linked to PD and detectable in circulating blood cells in a harmonized, large-scale data set. It will develop and test highly innovative multi-omics classifiers and provide a generally useful computational framework for large-scale, unbiased PD biomarker discovery. Project Narrative These large-scale studies are relevant to public health for two reasons. First, they will reveal the biomarker genes whose dysregulation of expression level is associated with (and possibly causal of) early development of Parkinson’s disease. Secondly, the multi-omics, DNA-RNA predictive model built here based on large dataset and advanced deep learning methods will provide a computational framework for further biomarker development and early disease prediction.",AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence,10157680,U01NS120637,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DNA', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopamine transporter', 'feature selection', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic signature', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,537000,-0.012265405306579857
"A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence have recently emerged as powerful techniques that can augment radiology interpretations and show promise for improving patient outcomes. One of the ways for ML to make a signiﬁcant impact on health care is in improving the evaluation of high-volume, low-cost exams for early signs of a wide variety of diseases.The routine chest x-ray is an ”opportunity for screening” for diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and congestive heart failure. For instance, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US, and is typically diagnosed at a higher stage than most other cancers leading to low survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality; however, few eli- gible people actually undergo LDCT screening. Meanwhile, chest x-rays continue to be the most common form of imaging worldwide. Improved detection from x-rays can direct patients to LDCT. COPD is another important disease that is often under-diagnosed. People with COPD are at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory infections, or exacerbations, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a chest x-ray may show poorly-deﬁned regions of consolidation that are concerning for pneumonia. Medical attention is re- quired to treat an infection or evaluate for other cause. More generally, methods to detect disease on chest x-rays can be extended to cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which are seen in congestive heart failure. Improved detection can direct patients to medical care. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a highly successful ML model, can be applied to chest x-ray images. However, few annotated medical datasets exist that are sufﬁciently large to train CNNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that bounding boxes used to localize disease can be incorporated into the training of CNNs and signiﬁcantly increase their accuracy. Unfortunately, medical datasets with such localized annotations are even rarer and are very limited in the number of cases due to the time-consuming process of creating bounding boxes by radiologists. We propose an innovative integrated approach using eye tracking, speech recording and novel vision and language models to create localized annota- tions in a manner that is non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist. The novelty of our approach is in the use of eye tracking during routine radiological reading. The challenge is to overcome the relatively ambiguous nature of eye tracking information compared to bounding boxes which provide deﬁnitive information about abnormalities. To address this challenge, we will also design new CNN architectures and learning algorithms that can use eye tracking and additional information such as pupil dilation and ﬁxation duration. The proposed methodology can easily scale up to create very large datasets without generating additional workload for radiologists. Furthermore, deployed in the reading room, it could provide a continuous stream of annotated images to expand training sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence hold the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the eval- uation of low cost, routine chest x-rays for early imaging abnormalities associated with diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia and making recommendations for follow-up care. To realize their full potential, machine learning algorithms require training on very large datasets with localized an- notations for abnormalities. We propose a novel data collection methodology using eye tracking that is scalable, non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist, and can generate very large datasets with localized annotations for the development of novel machine learning algorithms to address signiﬁcant medical problems.",A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology,9967745,R21EB028367,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiomegaly', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Language', 'Localized Disease', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mydriasis', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Pupil', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Screening Result', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'base', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data collection methodology', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical attention', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'scale up', 'screening', 'visual tracking']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,243364,0.04001457709502991
"Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the second-most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Among the different types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type and it constitutes 85% to 90% of all lung cancer cases. Current cancer research has shown that multiple somatic mutations affect the sensitivity of patients to various drugs used for NSCLC treatment. These mutations are essential factors for determining the most effective, “personalized” treatment for each NSCLC patient; however, most NSCLC patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies in their first year of treatment. Many mechanisms of this resistance are still unknown. Designing and prescribing better targeted therapies for NSCLC patients requires further understanding, particularly with respect to the relationship between NSCLC tumors’ pathological and clinical findings, genetic profiles, and targeted therapy responses/resistance. Currently, there is no computational method to connect observations and findings from pathology reports, medical records, somatic mutations, and the targeted therapy resistance. This project provides a plan to build a novel computational method to identify statistically significant associations between the pathological findings of NSCLC tumors and the presence of clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Furthermore, these associations, in combination with an innovative set of feature analysis from pathology reports and electronic medical records, will be leveraged to build and validate a machine-learning model to identify NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Finally, the associated clinical, pathological, and genetic findings for NSCLC patients will be used in a new machine-learning framework to predict patients’ time-to-resistance to targeted therapies. The required data to build and validate the proposed models in this project will be obtained through a collaboration with the Department of Pathology’s Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technologies at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. In addition to internal validation, the investigators in this proposal established a collaboration with the Department of Pathology at the University of Vermont Medical Center to apply and validate the developed models on an external data source. Upon successful implementation of this bioinformatics approach, the developed models will be able to reveal statistically significant links between clinical and pathological findings, clinically-actionable somatic mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for a better understanding of NSCLC tumor development and treatment. The proposed approach will provide an accurate, fast, and inexpensive pre- selection method for screening NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable mutations for translational research and precision medicine. Furthermore, the proposed machine-learning method to identify NSCLC patients’ resistance to targeted therapies will help healthcare providers to select the best treatment strategies for these patients, improve their health outcomes, and establish this precision medicine paradigm for other types of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Resistance to targeted therapies severely limits the ability to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This project proposes a novel computational approach to find statistically-significant links between pathological and clinical findings, clinically-actionable mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for NSCLC patients. The outcomes of this proposal can assist healthcare providers to identify the most effective strategy for NSCLC treatment, improve public health, and promote precision medicine.",Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management,10023259,R01CA249758,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Semantics', 'Smoking Status', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Pathology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Woman', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically actionable', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'men', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,375150,-0.024337999157322127
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care.

"PRISTINE: Pre-cancer histology identification of Endobronchial biopsies using deep learning PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. In order to increase survival, therapies are urgently needed to intercept the cancer development process and decrease the rate of patients presenting with advanced disease. A potential promising point of interception is to develop therapies to reverse or delay the development of lung premalignant lesions (PMLs). About 20% of lung cancers arise in the epithelial layer of the bronchial airways and these are preceded by the development of PMLs that are important clinical indicators of lung cancer risk in the airways or at remote parenchymal sites. As part of the NCI-Moonshot our group is engaged in creating a multi-omic lung Pre-Cancer Atlas (PCA). The success of this project in creating clinically relevant biomarkers and therapeutics depends on accurate assessments of histology and immune infiltrates in PMLs. Currently, however, pathologic assessment of the morphological stages of increasing abnormality from hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia (mild, moderate, and severe), to invasive carcinoma is challenging and not routine. The objective of the proposed study is to develop and disseminate a computationally efficient deep learning framework to annotate a variety of histologic features in PMLs from the Lung PCA and associate these features with clinical and genomic data. Our central hypothesis is that deep learning can be applied to digitized H&E whole slide images (WSIs) of bronchial PMLs to identify a comprehensive set of histologic features and metrics summarizing their spatial organization that may enhance biomarkers of PML progression to cancer. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. First, we will annotate PMLs and develop a semantic segmentation framework using deep learning to predict histologic features of PMLs. Second, we will disseminate our deep learning framework and show its utility in enhancing PML-associated biomarkers. The proposed study is significant because the framework we develop can be applied to predict other features in the WSIs from PMLs and be modified to encompass other PMLs of the lung (e.g. those associated with lung adenocarcinoma) as well as other premalignant lesions found in other epithelial tissue types such as breast, colon, prostate, etc. Currently, deep learning approaches have not been applied to PMLs, and this proposal is innovative in the unique clinical specimens that it leverages with corresponding genomic and clinical data and in its development of a patch- based convolutional neural network to predict histologic features of PMLs. Our long-term goal is to develop a deep learning framework to predict a variety of features from lung PML WSIs and integrate these with genomic data on these same samples to discover robust biomarkers of PML progression and therapeutics to prevent invasive cancer development. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study aims to develop and disseminate a computationally efficient deep learning framework to annotate histologic features in lung squamous premalignant lesions using digitized H&E whole slide images and associate these features with clinical and genomic data. We also aim to demonstrate the utility of our method in providing image-based features to enhance our genomic biomarkers of premalignant lesion progression. The methods and results based on the whole slide images can be integrated into a larger lung premalignant lesion atlas building initiative to advance lung cancer interception.",PRISTINE: Pre-cancer histology identification of Endobronchial biopsies using deep learning,10059031,R21CA253498,"['Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon', 'Computer software', 'Correlative Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dysplasia', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hyperplasia', 'Image', 'Immunosuppression', 'Institution', 'Intercept', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metaplasia', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'lung cancer screening', 'lung development', 'lung imaging', 'multiple omics', 'pathology imaging', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'screening program', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tumor', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2020,424256,0.043845387248349084
"Drug biomarker resources for precise translational research One goal of precision medicine is to select optimal therapies for individual patients based on drug biomarkers as well as disease symptoms/signs 1–3. The clinic has started to treat patients based on biomarkers. Examples include Gefitinib used to treat lung cancer patients with mutant EGFR and Vemurafenib used to treat melanoma patients with the BRAF V600E mutation. Clinical trials have also been tailored to recruit patients with the presence of specific biomarkers. A variety of preclinical studies have been conducted to discover biomarkers of investigational drugs. Recent large-scale molecular profiling of cell lines and pharmacogenomics even enables the prediction of biomarkers in silico. All these confirmed or investigational biomarkers (in silico, preclinical, in clinic) have emerged as critical components in modern translational research. However, our current knowledge about biomarkers is scattered and locked away in different places, including FDA labels, clinical trial descriptions, or publications, presenting a significant barrier to integrating them into knowledge graphs to augment reasoning. Therefore, we propose to create a novel composite knowledge source for biomarker discovery. This new source will improve the quality and quantity of connections between drug-biomarker-disease-patient and synthesize new knowledge for precision medicine research. To comply with established standards and aid the implementation of data/software standards for Translator, we will first develop an ontology to define biomarkers and their relationships with other biomedical entities. Next, we will leverage state of the art deep learning methods to extract biomarkers from publications and clinical trials. We will further adopt a crowd-sourcing approach using a large pool of medical students to manually inspect and curate biomarkers prioritized by our machine learning models. The machine learning models will be iteratively improved through a semi-supervised approach. To ensure high quality of provided knowledge, multiple lines (in silico, preclinical, in clinic) of evidence along with confidence scores will be associated with each biomarker. Through collaborating with NCATS staff, we will link biomarkers to other available resources to augment reasoning. We expect that the resource will be a critical component of a knowledge graph, enabling the query of novel questions related to precision medicine and the building of AI models. For example, can drug x work in a mouse model y where gene z is mutated? In what patient population may drug x be effective? Can drug x be repurposed to treat condition m where the biomarker of drug x is presented? Can we find new drugs/targets for those patients with the absence of the biomarker for the approved drug? Moreover, the labeled and well-curated data along with molecular profiles provide AI-ready resources for novel biomarker discovery that could be further validated by bench scientists. To achieve the goal, we have assembled an outstanding team comprising experts in biology, informatics, machine learning, ontology, and knowledge graph. Through two NIH-funded biomarker discovery projects, PI Dr. Chen has gained extensive knowledge in biomarker discovery, collected compelling use cases with bench collaborators, and built a tool for precision medicine. Co-I Dr. Duesbery, a biologist by training and Director of Research at Spectrum Health System, will lead the inspection of biomarkers using real-world data. By combining expertise of Dr. Krishnan who has built deep-learning methods to annotate disease samples from free-text, and Dr. Ding who specializes in ontology development and knowledge graph construction and mining, the team is well-positioned to accomplish the goals of this project. Potential challenges include the recruitment of domain experts to validate biomarkers for a wide range of diseases, the integration with the data provided in other projects, and the limited data resources to cover all diseases. The exploratory study in the first two segments will enable a better estimation of these challenges. n/a",Drug biomarker resources for precise translational research,10056488,OT2TR003426,"['Adopted', 'BRAF gene', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Funding', 'Gefitinib', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical Students', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'crowdsourcing', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'knowledge graph', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'molecular scale', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'ontology development', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'recruit', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NCATS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,OT2,2020,58210,-0.008367659992121976
"Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects up to 24 million people in the United States and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 with a total cost of $50 billion. COPD has been traditionally dichotomized into the clinical phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, emphysema is defined as abnormal, permanent dilation of the distal airspaces. The development and progression of this pathologic process are associated with a decline in lung function and progressive clinical impairment. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest is increasingly being leveraged to quantify the disease and its progression objectively. Current approaches to quantify emphysema progression are limited and discard most of the spatial and temporal information in CT scans obtained at inspiration and expiration. In this proposal, we plan on developing computational components to prognosticate emphysema progression that builds upon image density markers and lung mechanical strain characteristics conditioned on their underlying emphysema subtypes. This proposal leverages our previous experience in computational emphysema subtyping to discover, validate and translate a novel panel of prognostic markers tailored around the postulated mechanisms of emphysema progression: inflammation injury and mechanical strain. To reach this goals, we will (1) develop an advanced emphysema subtyping approach using novel deep learning architectures, (2) develop a fast mass preserving large displacement registration approach to enable the discovery of local elastic properties of lung tissue between inspiratory and expiration CT scans, (3) discover new subtype-specific biomarker features based on image density relations and mechanical properties using unsupervised deep learning techniques within a common statistical framework, and (4) validate the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers and their association with decline end-points and clinical outcomes to enable its clinical interpretation and translation. In addition to that, will be explored alternative prognostic models based on advanced machine learning techniques and performed a model comparison study to define the most prognostic model for emphysema progression. Our analysis will process 12,300 scans corresponding to 5,517 subjects with baseline and follow-up data from the COPDGene cohort –one of the largest cohort in COPD containing CT images at inspiration and expiration, respiratory and genetic measurements. The proposed methodology will provide reproducible, automatic and low-cost prognostic in-vivo biomarkers of emphysema progression that may enable the discovery of new therapies and translate them into clinical practice. Project Narrative Computed tomographic assessments of emphysema progression based on emphysema subtyping and lung mechanical strain biomarkers in the COPDGene study may provide insight into its prognostication. This may in turn lead to new therapies for patients with COPD.",Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression,9865706,R01HL149877,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alveolar wall', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Bronchitis', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complement', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Fracture', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung volume reduction surgery', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Smoker', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'expiration', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inclusion criteria', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'mechanical properties', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'respiratory', 'response', 'response to injury', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue stress']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,730139,0.04609138535889658
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9934164,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effectiveness validation', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,461573,0.11008919960288881
"The benefits and harms of lung cancer screening in Florida PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in both men and women in the United States. Currently, approximately 70% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, and the 5-year survival rate of advanced stage lung cancer is very low, at only 16%. Investigators have been searching for effective screening modalities for the early detection of lung cancer so that patients can receive curative treatments at an early stage. When the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan for lung cancer screening (LCS), researchers and physicians hope to save lives from lung cancer by screening high-risk population who aged 55 to 77 years and have a 30 pack years making history or former smokes who have quitted within the past 15 years. Since the release of the landmark NLST results, many medical associations published guidelines to recommend LDCT-based screening for individuals at high risk for lung cancer and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also decided to cover the LCS for Medicare beneficiaries who are at high risk for lung cancer. While many efforts have been made to accelerate the dissemination the beneficial LCS, the concerns over the high false positive rates (96.4% of the positive results), invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications and health care costs may hinder the utilization of lung cancer screening. This concern was magnified as researchers and policy makers started questioning whether the complication rate and false positives in real-world settings would be even higher than the rates reported in the NLST, which was conducted in a setting with well-established facilities and proficiency in cancer care. Therefore, we propose to understand the contemporary use of lung cancer screening and associated health care outcomes and costs using data from a real-world setting. Our study has three goals: 1) to develop an innovative computable phenotype algorithm to identify high-risk and low-risk individuals for LCS from both structured and unstructured (i.e., clinical notes) electronic health record (EHR) data and to develop advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract LCS related clinical information from clinical notes such as radiology reports; 2) to determine the appropriate and inappropriate use of LDCT among high-risk and low-risk individuals in Florida and to examine the test results of LDCT, the rates of invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and incidental findings in real-world settings; and 3) to develop and validate a microsimulation model of the clinical courses of LCS incorporating the real-world data in LCS to estimate the long-term benefits and the cost-effectiveness of LCS. Our proposed study has the potential to reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality by informing policymakers and practitioners on the appropriateness of contemporary use of LCS. This knowledge will help both patients and physicians better understand the harm- benefit tradeoff of lung cancer screening and transform such knowledge into practice to prevent avoidable postprocedural complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer screening using Low-dose computed tomography is a promising technique to reduce the burden of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Concerns over high false positives, invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and downstream health care costs impede developing and promoting lung cancer screening program.

"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally.

"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it has the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. Findings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9981789,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'bronchial epithelium', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'random forest', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2020,589485,0.044394326484958266
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease, with a clinically relevant context of use.",Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH),10055845,R01NS114552,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anticoagulants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cavernous Hemangioma', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'IL6 gene', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Immunity', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'data harmonization', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbiome', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular unit', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'synergism', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,689695,-0.0011051117216003264
"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort. The successful outcome of this study will aid physicians in identifying patients for targeted therapies.",Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM,9865565,R01HL150023,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'regional difference', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,700225,0.06534504420266916
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics. We propose to use multiple types of biologic data to identify different COPD subtypes, which may be important for disease prognosis and treatment.",Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,9975882,K08HL136928,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Expert Opinion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung volume reduction surgery', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'SNP array', 'Severities', 'Spirometry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'machine learning method', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,172800,0.06823146688172461
"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",9846014,K23HL145011,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dysbarism', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Esophagus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Induction of neuromuscular blockade', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manometry', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prone Position', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training Programs', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computerized', 'dynamic system', 'esophagus pressure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'lung injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized strategies', 'pressure', 'programs', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2020,170640,0.02506751509114038
"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9902564,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,353176,-0.011709860101552765
"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease. This will enable us to identify susceptible patients at the earliest possible moment, track their disease progression, and ultimately shift treatment strategies from palliating disease related symptoms to preventing disease development.",Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT,9843731,K08HL145118,"['Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Award', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Densitometry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Evolution', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Factor', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'exercise capacity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'lung injury', 'mange', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'palliate', 'palliating symptoms', 'palliation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoking-related lung disease', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170320,0.034238562086826047
"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer has a high fatality rate because most patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when the disease is more difficult to cure.

"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9830022,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'risk prediction model', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,178349,0.09082209636975949
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,10020427,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'lung hypoxia', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,2331272,0.06925653663896128
"Enhancing the I AM GOLD study with single-cell deep phenotyping and machine learning meta-analysis Project Summary/Abstract Patients with HIV are at increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death worldwide. In this proposal, our long-term goal is to identify the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of COPD with HIV infection. Our central hypothesis is that enhanced Th17 driven inflammation and chronic Gammaproteobacteria-dominated airway microbiota interact to contribute to obstructive lung disease in HIV+ individuals. This hypothesis is based on the following evidence. First, we have found in HIV- uninfected COPD patients that a genomic signature of Th17 driven airway inflammation marks a COPD subgroup with functional small airway disease, which is thought to precede emphysema. Second, Th17 driven inflammation, a pathway classically thought to defend against bacteria, is enhanced in the airways of HIV+ patients. Third, our group has shown that amongst Ugandan HIV+ patients with pneumonia, a population at higher risk for lung function decline, there are subgroups characterized by distinct lower airway microbial communities with differing immune responses. One subgroup had Pseudomonadaceae-dominated airway microbiota and inflammatory gene expression. Gammaproteobacteria, which includes Pseudomonas, are commonly found in COPD and, as with Th17 inflammation, are associated with emphysema. Thus, the Pseudomonadaceae-dominant pneumonia subgroup may be at higher risk for developing chronic disease in the setting of continued dysbiosis and low level Th17 driven chronic inflammation. Our proposed specific aims will use existing and newly collected samples from our international multi-center study of HIV-associated COPD, I AM OLD (Inflammation, Aging, Microbes and Obstructive Lung Disease), in which HIV+ participants in Uganda and San Francisco are enrolled at the time of acute pneumonia and followed longitudinally. Aim 1 will identify the airway microbial communities and inflammatory gene expression markers at the time of acute infection that are associated with subsequent incident COPD and lung function decline in HIV. Aim 2 will identify the airway microbial communities and inflammatory gene expression markers during chronic stable disease that are enhanced in HIV+COPD compared to participants without COPD (HIV+COPD-). In Aim 3 we will perform integrative analyses of the airway microbiome, microbial and human transcriptome, metabolome and lung radiographic changes in HIV+COPD. We anticipate the following outcomes: 1) identification of the predominant airway microbiome-host response interactions associated with HIV+COPD in two international at- risk populations, 2) identification of metabolome alterations associated with specific microbial communities and inflammatory responses in HIV+COPD, 3) delineation of the range of radiographic abnormalities associated with microbiome-host response interactions in HIV+COPD. We expect these outcomes to have a positive impact, providing a new understanding of the biology underlying the enhanced risk for COPD amongst the HIV- infected population which could direct therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative In this proposal, our long-term goal is to identify the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of COPD with HIV infection. Our central hypothesis is that enhanced Th17 driven inflammation and chronic Gammaproteobacteria-dominated airway microbiota interact to contribute to obstructive lung disease in HIV+ individuals. We will test this hypothesis in an ongoing international multi-center study of HIV-associated COPD in which HIV+ participants in Uganda and San Francisco are enrolled at the time of acute pneumonia, characterized comprehensively for airway infection and the associated inflammatory response, and followed longitudinally.",Enhancing the I AM GOLD study with single-cell deep phenotyping and machine learning meta-analysis,10177730,R01HL143998,"['Acute Pneumonia', 'Aging', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Enrollment', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Microbe', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pseudomonadaceae', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Stable Disease', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Uganda', 'acute infection', 'airway inflammation', 'base', 'disorder subtype', 'dysbiosis', 'functional decline', 'genomic signature', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'respiratory microbiome', 'respiratory microbiota', 'small airways disease', 'transcriptome']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,89962,0.024919357640502692
"Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in Africa is almost completely unknown, yet molecular profiling and institution of targeted therapy is now standardly used to influence care in patients with actionable mutations. HIV- infection is associated with a markedly increased risk of lung cancer, but its association with lung cancer and how it influences disease outcomes is not well studied. The capacity to correctly diagnose lung cancer on radiological images, tissue specimen acquisition, and subsequent histologic confirmation compounds the problem of under and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in Africa, especially with the prevalence and often presumptive clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. In this consortium proposal, we therefore seek to address the above stated problems by 1) establishing national lung cancer diagnostic referral networks in Uganda and Tanzania, which will allow for improved detection of lung cancer and, hence decrease the lung cancer burden; 2) investigating the role of HIV-1 infection on the incidence and outcomes of lung cancer in the region; 3) determining the molecular profile of lung cancer in East African countries in order to facilitate advocacy for scale- up of targeted therapies (including immune-based therapies); 4) building capacity for lung cancer diagnosis and care in terms of improving imaging, pathology, radiology and tissue acquisition and clinical care of lung cancer 5) creating a lung cancer research collaboration that will build capacity through mentoring of junior researchers for future leadership in the field. At the end of this project, we envision an African-led lung cancer research network, clinical expertise for sample acquisition and care, improved pathology and radiology diagnostics services, a lung cancer screening program, and a large biorepository that should support lung cancer research in the region for many years to come. We propose to study lung cancer in Uganda and Tanzania and the relationship to HIV-1 infection through three project-based and three cores. The results of these studies of the epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging of lung cancer and the relationship to HIV infection will lead to technological transfer of instrumentation to characterize lung cancer and artificial intelligence algorithms to aid in discerning pulmonary granulomatous disease from lung cancer on radiological imaging. Findings herein may lead to the development of country-specific guidelines in the evaluation and management of lung cancer.","Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging",10084623,U54CA254566,"['Address', 'Advocacy', 'Africa', 'African', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Granulomatous', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lung', 'Lung Capacity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Tanzania', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'lung cancer screening', 'lung imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'screening program', 'targeted treatment']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,1024684,0.08413274929151736
"Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of hospitalization in the US. Exacerbations - a worsening or “flare up” of symptoms - cause most COPD hospitalizations. Since most exacerbations can be treated with changes of inhalers and/or oral medications, at-home detection of lung function deterioration may facilitate earlier intervention and help delay or prevent hospitalizations. The Standards of Care for monitoring lung function are spirometry, plethysmography, and CT scan. However, these are expensive methods and unsuited for continuous monitoring or at-home use. Various patient self-monitoring approaches have been tried, for example, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate monitoring, and peak flow metering, but their efficacy in reducing hospitalizations has been limited.  A common finding for all forms of COPD is air trapping, defined, as an abnormal increase in the volume of air remaining in the lungs after exhalation is complete. A body of evidence definitively shows that air trapping increases during exacerbations and decreases when exacerbations resolve. Recent reports show that air trapping is an earlier harbinger of deteriorating lung function than spirometric changes, and can be measured by low-frequency ultrasound (1-40 kHz). Acoustic monitoring of air trapping could provide clinicians with a non- invasive tool when medical intervention is needed to avoid unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations.  Respira Labs has developed a low-cost, non-invasive, acoustic-based wearable device that can continually monitor lung resonance: Sylvee. The device uses known acoustic-based technology with machine- learning algorithms to detect minor changes in lung resonance, which our preliminary results suggest correspond to changes in air trapping. The overall objective of this project is to validate Sylvee's air trapping algorithms in a cohort of 20 healthy controls and 40 COPD patients with and without air trapping, respectively. In Aims 1 and 2, we will miniaturize and add sensors to the Sylvee device and develop a user interface (UI) and a mobile application. In Aims 3 and 4, we will create an Air Trapping Index Report and validate it in a cross-sectional study vis-à-vis whole body plethysmography as a control. Results of this project provide a go/no-go development decision based on device function. We can apply these results in STTR Phase II, in a larger clinical study to evaluate Sylvee as an at-home monitoring system, with a goal of reducing hospitalizations by at least 30%. Ultimately, Sylvee will allow physicians to remotely monitor their patients' lung function and adjust their medications to reduce healthcare costs and improve patients' quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than 12 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, and another 17 million may have COPD, but are unaware of it. By 2020, the costs associated with COPD are estimated to be $72B billion per year, of which with ~50% are the costs of spent on ER visits and hospitalizations. The goal of this proposal is to establish and validate a seamless and non-obtrusive wearable that measures abnormal air trapping via a novel acoustic technology, which would reduce hospitalizations through at-home monitoring of lung function.","Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD",10080272,R41HL152769,"['Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Bluetooth', 'Bronchoconstriction', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Bronchitis', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Edema', 'Emergency department visit', 'Exhalation', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Miniaturization', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous body substance', 'Noise', 'Oral', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Particulate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Veterans', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'Wireless Technology', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air monitoring', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'novel', 'ozone exposure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"RESPIRA LABS, LLC",R41,2020,350000,0.051640664254048806
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9927686,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,340025,-0.01905722415161567
"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9975215,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170639,0.04497581496750766
"The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background and long-term objectives: This proposed research will advance our understanding of how the lung microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of oxygen-induced lung injury. Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies. Yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have recently discovered that hyperoxia acutely alters lung microbiota. This oxygen-induced dysbiosis is strongly and temporally correlated with alveolar inflammation. We have discovered that germ-free mice - experimental mice devoid of microbiota - are protected from oxygen- induced lung injury, an observation that cannot be explained via our conventional model of oxygen-induced lung injury. Conversely, lung injury alters lung microbiota by changing bacterial growth conditions within the lung microenvironment. We have discovered that germ-free mice are protected from non-resolving lung injury (bleomycin), indicating that the microbiome is necessary for perpetuation of lung injury. The discovery of the lung microbiome has thus broadened our model of pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which lung microbiota mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, and are in turn altered by lung injury, are undetermined. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific bacteria within the lung ecosystem propel alveolar inflammation in oxygen-induced lung injury, and these bacteria are enriched within the lung microbiome both by hyperoxia itself and by the altered ecology of injured lungs. The rationale is that these discoveries will facilitate the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of oxygen-related human lung disease. Specific Aim 1: To determine the microbial and molecular pathways by which oxygen therapy alters lung microbiota, mediating host inflammation and injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: in vivo heterogeneity analysis of host-microbiome interactions in mice; in vivo germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated hyperoxia modeling in mice; data science interrogation of observational human data using a validated machine-learning algorithm. Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular pathways by which oxygen-induced host inflammation and injury alter lung microbiota, perpetuating respiratory dysbiosis and lung injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: a novel ex vivo culture assay that identifies host- derived mediators of bacterial growth; in vivo augmentation and inhibition of the host response in hyperoxia. This translational research approach will determine 1) the key members of the lung microbiome that mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, 2) the pathways by which these bacteria promote alveolar inflammation, and 3) the ecologic factors within the injured lung environment that promote their growth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies, yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and severe lung disease. We have recently discovered that the lung microbiome - the communities of microbes living in the respiratory tract - are altered by inhaled oxygen and necessary for the development of oxygen-induced lung injury. This proposed research plan will reveal how the lung microbiome contributes to oxygen-induced lung injury, and provide us with new ways to prevent and treat this common clinical problem.",The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury,9893017,R01HL144599,"['Acute', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Bleomycin', 'Clinical', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Therapy Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Respiratory System', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Translational Research', 'dysbiosis', 'host microbiome', 'host microbiota', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'lung injury', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,415715,0.09091036265950106
"Systems Biology in Vaping Product Exposure ABSTRACT Inhalation of electronically aerosolized vapors, or vaping, has grown substantially in the past decade. A recent outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) has raised concern for the public health impact of the behavior. Effects on the lung both acutely and chronically are not well-understood, and mechanisms of lung damage have not been fully elucidated. EVALI cases are in part thought to be due to in- halation of toxic chemicals, such as vitamin E acetate, contained within the diluent of the product; however, factors determining individual susceptibility to EVALI are unclear. Changes in the metabolic milieu of the lung could also alter the structure and function of the lung microbiome, further perpetuating injury. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated alterations in the lung metabolome in EVALI patients compared to individuals with lung injury from other causes and to a healthy control and an HIV-infected individual with chronic vape use as well as alterations in pulmonary function with chronic vaping. In the current proposal, we will measure multi- ple parallel molecular and clinical datasets to test the hypothesis that interactions of the metabolome, microbi- ome, and the host are critical in development of injury secondary to e-vapor exposure. We will build a compre- hensive, systems-level model of the cellular and microbial milieu in the lung of subjects with chronic e-vapor exposure and from inpatients with acute EVALI to understand the transition from chronic exposure to acute injury. We will apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to better understand and clas- sify features distinguishing acute vaping induced lung injury from non-vaping associated lung injury and from chronic lung injury related to e-vapor exposure. In addition, we will develop a novel ex vivo lung perfusion model that can be used for future mechanistic studies arising from our investigations. Leveraging the infra- structure within the Systems Biology of Diffusion Impairment in HIV study (R01HL140963), we have the oppor- tunity to examine a continuum of vaping and lung impairment including chronic vaping in a healthy population, chronic vaping in HIV+ individuals who may have enhanced susceptibility to vaping, and in patients with EVALI through the following aims: Aim 1: To identify causal molecular pathways underlying the host response to chronic e-vapor exposure by integrating clinical features and -omics data from ambulatory individuals. Aim 2: To identify predictive signatures of respiratory impairment from clinical features, transcriptomic, microbiome, and metabolomic data using clinical specimens from hospitalized individuals with EVALI. Aim 3: To develop a clinically relevant ex-vivo model of ENDD exposure to facilitate mechanistic investigation and evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions. This project will leverage existing resources to identify complex associations and causal relationships in vaping-associated lung injury and lay the groundwork for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Our study will fill a gap in understanding of the transcriptional, metabolic and microbial landscape of the respiratory tract in individuals with both chronic exposure to e-vapor products and EVALI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhalation of electronically aerosolized vapors, or vaping, has grown substantially in the past decade. Effects on the lung both acutely and chronically are not well-understood, and mechanisms that contribute to lung damage have not been fully elucidated. The complexity and the individualized differences in causes of these abnormalities have been challenging to unravel using traditional approaches.

"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9888409,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,319844,0.005346704435038089
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9878098,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2020,696730,-0.009603934964567457
"Radiologist-Centered Artificial Intelligence (RCAI) for Lung Cancer Screening and Diagnosis No abstract available NARRATIVE Although artificial intelligence (AI) based computer aided diagnosis systems have been shown to be useful in lung cancer screening and diagnosis, current radiology practice still suffers from (1) high rates of missed tumors and (2) imprecise lung nodule characterization (malignant vs. benign).

"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,9995661,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,615104,-0.017467382633542028
"Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients The objective of this proposal is to develop a predictive model to identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and at risk of developing severe COVID-19. Louisiana has the 5th highest death rate per capita in the United States as of May 4th, 2020. Severe disease is seen in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. The New Orleans population is particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are rampant. After infection, acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. Mounting evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 have cytokine storm syndrome, which may exacerbate multiorgan injury and risk of fibrotic complications. Lack of effective ways to identify and attenuate severe COVID-19 progression persist due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for cytokine storm syndrome and increased risk in older patients. Therefore, there is a need to determine the critical cytokine profiles responsible for severe COVID-19 progression to develop effective treatments. Further, it is essential to find a way to stage disease trajectory(ies) to identify therapeutic targets with precision to attenuate disease progression and uncover preventive strategies. Towards this end, we seek to leverage a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage to predict severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis by considering key cytokine-cell interactions. We hypothesize that the model will accurately predict quantitative changes in suites of key cytokines and matrix accumulation with varying COVID-19 progression within 10% accuracy. To accomplish this, we have assembled an investigative team at Tulane University with key expertise in virology, clinical infectious disease research, bioinformatics, and predictive mathematical models of tissue remodeling. In Aim 1 of the proposal, we will identify the critical cytokine markers linked to viral-induced lung damage and pulmonary fibrosis. This will be accomplished by leveraging machine learning to determine the biomarkers and molecular pathways characterizing progression of severe COVID-19 to focus model formulation. In Aim 2, we will predict the severity of COVID-19 in older patients. Model predictions will be compared to blood markers of COVID-19 disease in cohorts of older patients at different stages of disease progression. The model will be refined and informed by cytokine data to discern causal biological pathways and disease processes that can be tested and targeted. Our expected outcome is to have determined the critical cytokine interactions responsible for lung tissue damage and dictating pathways for varying disease trajectories in older patients. These results are expected to have an important impact as the proposed predictive model will open new avenues of research to rationally design pharmaceutical interventions for severe COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the study will provide a paradigm-shifting open-source tool to delineate target therapeutics, estimate their efficacy, and move towards development of patient-specific treatment plans for older individuals. Severe COVID-19 is seen in older individuals and those with underlying complications such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Lack of effective ways to identify and halt severe COVID-19 progression persists due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for increased risk and cytokine storm syndrome. Towards this end, in this proposal we will test our hypothesis that a mathematical model informed by key patient- specific suites of cytokines is capable of predicting patient trajectories, which will provide a strong evidence- based proof of concept for future efforts to rationally design interventions for severe COVID-19 patients.",Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients,10162283,P20GM103629,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'Cell Communication', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibrosis', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Louisiana', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'extracellular', 'genetic predictors', 'individualized medicine', 'lung injury', 'mathematical model', 'molecular pathology', 'multiorgan injury', 'nonhuman primate', 'older patient', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'repaired', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'virology', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,P20,2020,379884,-0.006105290861427938
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9999688,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192564,-0.00884292786429988
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9983146,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'blood-brain barrier disruption', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,198907,0.020667569467013078
"Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF. This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study (R01HL134851). With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr. Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an increasingly prevalent chronic lung disease with no available cure; frailty affects 50% of IPF patients, and is associated with increased severity of illness in response to acute insults, which are the most common cause of death in IPF. We identified that visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for frailty and propose to investigate potential mechanisms linking visceral adipose tissue and frailty, as modifiable risk factors for morbidity and mortality in this growing patient population. Our findings may lead to novel therapies and clinical trials evaluating the role of existing medications in the prevention and treatment of frailty in IPF.",Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,10055250,K23HL150280,"['Acute', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Cause of Death', 'Central obesity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Interleukin-1 Receptors', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Societies', 'Somatotropin', 'Somatotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Steroids', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'androgenic', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'frailty', 'growth hormone deficiency', 'health related quality of life', 'hormone analog', 'human old age (65+)', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'reduced muscle mass', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sarcopenic obesity', 'skills training', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'translational approach', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K23,2020,170856,0.02064469998263402
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,9838156,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,3521,0.10091792313345052
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9925731,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,653985,0.01838481730789955
"Development of a Rapid Method for Imaging Regional Ventilation in Small Animals w/o Contrast Agents The objective of this R01 application is to develop a rapid method for imaging regional ventilation and lung compliance in small animals without contrast agents. Much of our current understanding of the normal functioning of the lung and mechanisms of lung disease comes from small animal studies. However, lung function imaging in small animal models is technically challenging due to motion and the relatively small size of the lungs. Pulmonary function testing using plethysmography has been employed to assess lung function and injury with limited validity and utility, particularly in small animals. Additionally, only aggregate measures of functional performance are produced and no regional lung changes can be assessed. An improved imaging method that could provide spatially- and temporally-resolved information regarding ventilation would be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases. It would also facilitate drug discovery and efficacy studies aimed to mitigate respiratory pathology. The ideal method would provide quantitative regional functional information, be applicable to longitudinal studies (low radiation dose), and have a simple and affordable implementation that permits widespread use. Currently available imaging methods including micro-CT or MRI fall short in one or more of these requirements.  To address this need, we will establish and evaluate a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X- ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for ventilation imaging in small animal models. The lung is ideally suited to XPC imaging because it is comprised mainly of air spaces separated by thin tissue structures. The air-tissue interfaces cause the X-ray beam to experience numerous and strong refractions that produce a distinctive texture in the intensity measured over the lungs known as speckle. Detailed information regarding the regional lung air volume (RLAV) distribution is encoded in the speckle. The benefits of exploiting lung speckle for detecting and monitoring lung function are numerous but remain entirely unexplored for benchtop imaging.  Our approach involves a high degree of technical innovation regarding image formation methods and will significantly extend the current boundaries of functional lung imaging in small animals. The proposed method, referred to as parametric XPC (P-XPC) imaging, will produce 2D parametric images that depict the projected RLAV distribution. When differential images are computed for any given two points in the breathing cycle, ventilation or lung compliance imaging will be achieved. Preliminary in vivo and computational studies have been conducted in support of the proposed research. The specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Develop P-XPC image formation methods for estimating the projected RLAV distribution; Aim 2: Optimize an XPC imaging system for P-XPC imaging. Aim 3: Evaluate the diagnostic capability of P-XPC imaging in two pre-clinical animal models of disease in vivo. The proposed research will result in a novel, easy to implement, and highly effective X-ray phase-contrast (XPC) method for functional lung imaging in small animal models. It will provide spatially- and temporally- resolved information regarding lung ventilation that will be of great value to those studying basic pulmonary physiology and the onset and progression of a large range of respiratory diseases.",Development of a Rapid Method for Imaging Regional Ventilation in Small Animals w/o Contrast Agents,9888370,R01EB023045,"['Address', 'Air', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Breathing', 'Communities', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technical Degree', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'animal imaging', 'base', 'computer studies', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'detector', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'falls', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'lung imaging', 'lung injury', 'lung pressure', 'lung volume', 'machine learning method', 'microCT', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'rapid technique', 'respiratory', 'supervised learning', 'ventilation']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,419843,0.027670698042294432
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Development of a Novel Lung Function Imaging Modality for comprehensive management of lung cancer Our project proposes an academic-industrial partnership to translate a novel lung function imaging modality into clinical care for lung cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Lung cancer patients being treated with radiation can experience serious and sometimes life threatening thoracic side effects from treatment. There is emerging data demonstrating that a novel lung function imaging modality can reduce side-effects and improve quality of life for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The novel lung function imaging modality, referred to as ‘4DCT-ventilation,’ uses 4DCT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively calculate lung ventilation maps. 4DCT-ventilation can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients by enabling the generation of functional avoidance radiotherapy plans. Functional avoidance uses 4DCT-ventilation to avoid functional portions of the lung, with the hypothesis that reducing dose to functional lung will reduce thoracic side- effects. Our 4DCT-ventilation research has progressed from retrospective studies to an early-phase trial using 4DCT-ventilation for functional avoidance radiotherapy. The early promising toxicity results from 4DCT- ventilation clinical trials is providing a strong rationale for national trials and expanded clinical integration across individual clinics. The problem is that expanded clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation is currently not possible due to a lack of consistent, efficient, and clinically validated methods. We propose an academic-industry partnership with MIM Software to address these challenges precluding clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation.  The purpose of our study is to develop methods that enable safe, efficient, and clinically validated methods for clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance. Our overarching hypothesis is that the 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance innovations we develop will be demonstrated to reduce lung toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience. The project will be carried out in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop methods that enable automated 4DCT-ventilation calculations including auto-segmentation, statistically-robust calculation methods, and clinically-efficient quality assurance tools. Aim 2 will develop methods for 4DCT- ventilation functional avoidance radiotherapy including image heterogeneity assessment, development of knowledge-based functional planning methods, and evaluation of metrics most critical in reducing toxicity. In conjunction with our industry partner, the developed methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated in a commercial-grade software tool. Aim 3 will evaluate feasibility by assessing whether 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance can be demonstrated to reduce toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience.  Our project will generate both the tools and data needed to provide guidance on how to properly incorporate 4DCT-ventilation into clinical care. The methods and data will culminate in a commercial-grade platform suitable for busy clinics. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients and our project will enable the integration of this novel imaging modality into clinical care. Our project proposes to form an academic-industrial partnership to translate a novel lung function imaging modality into radiotherapy clinical care for lung cancer patients. The novel lung function imaging modality is referred to as `4DCT-ventilation,' and uses 4-Dimensional CT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively calculate lung functional maps. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to reduce toxicity and improve outcomes for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.

"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer. Therefore, the test could complement LDCT for the early detection lung cancer, and thereby reduce the mortality and cost. Here we propose to develop an easy and cost-effective test for accurately distinguishing malignant from benign lung nodules. Future use of the test will complement CT screening for the early detection of lung cancer, and ultimately reduce lung cancer-associated deaths.",A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules,9970448,R21CA240556,"['Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Marriage', 'Medical', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Pathology', 'Physics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'male', 'men', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'never smoker', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'screening program', 'success', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,168019,0.086394700385391
"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications.

"SonoHeal: Smart Resonating Closed-loop Airway Clearance Device Project Summary  Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects 30,000 patients in the USA with an average life span of 37 years and the majority (85%) of the mortality is a result of lung disease. Airway Clearance Therapies (ACT) are extensively used by patients for forceful mechanical clearance of mucus accumulated in airways using high pressure and high frequency vibrations. However, the use of ACTs is intrusive, painful, uncomfortable, and poses tremendous burden on patients who are required to perform ACTs daily for 1-2 hours. Without effective ACT, the mucus-plugged airways trap bacteria causing infections, inflammations, respiratory failures, and other complications. ACT is also used by patients with lung conditions where mucus clearance is necessary (e.g. bronchiectasis, COPD, Asthma).  ACT works on the principle of vibrating the lungs to increase mucus mobility. Ideally, the therapy needs to be individualized and continuously adaptive for effective clearance. However, none of the current ACT devices and techniques, including chest physiotherapy, high-frequency chest compression, oscillation, and acoustic vibration therapies, are adaptive. The challenges with current ACT devices: 1. Brute-force approach: Patients have diverse airway geometry, mucus accretion levels, and obstruction locations. Optimal therapy requires input frequencies to match the resonant frequency of specific airways to target mucus clearance. Current ACT devices work on a set vibration pattern (Vest, oPEP, CPT) or a “feeling- based” subjective tweaking of input frequencies and airway location (Frequencer, VibraLung), often rendering them ineffective. 2. Subjective Assessment: None of the current devices measure lung function to provide a quantitative assessment of the airway obstruction or therapy progress putting the burden on the patient to determine treatment effectiveness. 3. Poor Quality of Life: As a result, patients perform uncomfortable ACT for long durations to see a positive effect, leading to poor adherence to ACT. Further, home ACTs are considered ineffective for a large segment of the patient population due to the lack of personalized treatment. Cognita Labs’s proposed solution, SonoHeal, will be the first device to adapt the treatment in real-time based on the patient’s lung status, such that the right airways are targeted for stimulation/vibration to reduce the reliance on patient’s guesswork as well as provide effective therapy by localizing airway clearance. SonoHeal will utilize Cognita’s patent-pending airway monitoring technology that measures airway obstruction in real- time. Combined with quantified lung response with mucus localization information, SonoHeal will algorithmically tune the right resonant frequency to target patient’s airways and promote effective mucus removal. In this proposal, Cognita’s team will bring years of airway modeling, device technologies and commercialization experience to conduct in-vitro experimentation on multiple lung models to show the feasibility and efficiency of the SonoHeal device in a lab setup. PROJECT NARRATIVE Airway Clearance Therapies (ACT) are critical daily requirement for Cystic Fibrosis patients to remove mucus from the lungs and avoid infections and pulmonary exacerbations. Current ACT devices work on the principals of violently vibrating/shaking the lung which leads to ineffective, uncomfortable and long therapy times.

"Genetic interaction analysis involving oncogenesis-related genes in lung cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  The development of cancer diseases is driven by the accumulation of many oncogenesis-related genetic alterations and tumorigenesis is triggered by complex networks of involved genes rather than independent actions. The interactions among genetic factors are believed to play important roles in carcinogenesis and contribute to the missing heritability. In this proposal, we designed a filtered gene-gene interaction analysis aiming to identify the epistasis involving important oncogenesis-related genes. Besides the advantage of dimensional reduction and increased power, this filtered interaction analysis will help us identify novel oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes implicated in lung cancer development that will not be revealed in main effect association analysis. It will also identify novel susceptibility variants, including those in intergenic and non-coding regions, affecting lung cancer risk by interacting/modulating with oncogenesis-related genes. Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease and researchers have identified vast differences in genomic attributes. However, the knowledge about epistatic features in lung cancer subtypes is limited. We will conduct a stratified epistasis analysis by lung cancer histology subtype in the proposed study to reveal subtype-specific genetic interactions and gene networks. The stratified analysis by histology will enhance our understanding about this complicated disease mechanism in lung cancer and has the potential to contribute to precision medicine in lung cancer treatment.  A main challenge in genetic association studies is to understand the functional consequences of identified genetic variants. In this study, we proposed functional annotation analysis including eQTL gene expression analysis, pathway and gene network analysis, and functional annotation of epistasis-involved SNPs. This integrative epistasis and functional annotation analysis will help us pinpoint the causal epistasis and characterize the epistasis-involved genes or regions in lung cancer risk development. It will be a pilot study to explore how the regulatory non-coding variants impact lung cancer risk by interacting with oncogenesis-related genes.  The proposed study will provide insights about the complicated biological interactions that are critical for gene regulation, biochemical networks, and developmental pathways implicated in lung carcinogenesis. In order to finish the proposed study, we collected the genotype data from three independent GWAS studies including 24,037 lung cancer patients and 20,401 healthy controls from the Caucasian population. The genotype and gene expression data in lung tissues from 409 individuals will be applied for eQTL gene expression analysis.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,9998187,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,824479,0.03369756976248162
"Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted society, communities, and the healthcare system across the world, and threatens to continue to challenge society for the coming months and years. More than 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and more than 60,000 Americans have lost their lives as of the writing of this proposal. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a wearable physiological sensing solution for COVID-19 patient management, including diagnosis, triage, and monitoring of patients based on lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measures captured with the same device. The central innovation lies in the hardware and algorithms that have been proposed for this purpose, building upon the team’s prior work in other areas of wearable bio-acoustic sensing and bioimpedance spectroscopy. The following two specific aims are proposed for the research: (1) to design, implement, and validate a wearable sensing system for lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measurements; and (2) to test and evaluate this system to assess efficacy and potential information derived in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and persons under investigation for COVID-19 longitudinally. Successful completion of this project would result in a validated prototype for sensing multiple parameters of cardiopulmonary health in patients with COVID-19, with imminent feasibility to transition the technology to commercialization and through regulatory pathways. This would provide a much-needed patient management technology for this novel coronavirus to healthcare practitioners and ultimately a means to monitor patients remotely to ensure that any deterioration in health is detected as early as possible. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the US and the rest of the world in an unparalleled manner, taking nearly 60,000 lives in the US alone over the past two months and afflicting more than a million Americans, with costs to society that are difficult to measure or bear. Technologies for improving the management of patients presenting at the emergency room are urgently needed in this era, specifically for determining whether such patients should be cared for in the intensive care unit, via infectious diseases procedures, or otherwise. We propose to design a wearable system for measuring lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and movement in the same device to address these critical needs.","Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19",10163297,R01EB023808,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Temperature', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data Analytics', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Respiratory distress', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Temperature', 'Societies', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'miniaturize', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'synergism', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,396542,0.02098130872111663
"Multi-tissue high-throughput proteomic and genomic study in Parkinson's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide, with the prevalence projected to double in the next few decades. Despite the improvements in high-throughput genomics and proteomics that have significantly facilitated the advancement of biomarker discovery in other neurodegenerative diseases, there are no reliable biomarkers for PD. Currently, the PD diagnosis relies almost entirely on clinical examination. There are several reasons for the lack of reliable biomarkers in PD including most studies have been focused on single molecules in one tissue, small samples sizes and a lack of independent replication cohorts. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging a unique resource that includes quantitative proteomic analysis of ~1,300 proteins from CSF and plasma of clinically diagnosed PD patients coupled with validation in brain samples from autopsy-confirmed PD cases. We will pair the proteomic data with novel and powerful unbiased (hypothesis-free) genomic approaches to select the most plausible candidates for targeted replication studies. This large-scale screening of ~3,110 samples could identify biomarkers of known molecular pathways involving PD or with a clear genetic connection to PD risk. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify proteins differentially expressed in PD patients in plasma, CSF or brain tissue. We plan to carry out a quantitative proteomic analysis using Somalogic SOMAscan® assay of plasma (n=600) and CSF (n=200) from clinically diagnosed PD patients and of brain tissue (n=200) from autopsy-confirmed PD patients. We will also evaluate CSF (n=740), plasma (n=410) and brain tissue (n=114) from an independent cohort of healthy individuals and CSF (n=275), plasma (n=234) and brain tissue (n=345) from AD patients. We expect to obtain precise and accurate levels of a large number of proteins across multiple tissues in the analyzed samples. Specific Aim 2: To prioritize candidate biomarkers based on an integrative analysis of proteomic and genome-wide genotyping data using Mendelian Randomization (MR). We plan to integrate proteomic and GWAS data to identify protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) and apply MR approaches to determine proteins involved in the causal pathway of PD. Using this approach, we will be able to select reliable PD biomarker candidates for validation. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether genetic and proteomic data improves biomarker specificity. We will ascertain whether combining proteomic and genomic data could increase biomarker accuracy. We expect to uncover a genome-proteome network that may provide a basis for novel approaches to diagnostic and pharmacotherapeutic applications in PD. Narrative Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Currently, there are no reliable, sensitive and specific biomarkers identified in PD to date.

"The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on gut fungal commensal ecology, the mycobiome, in the neonatal period to advance mechanistic understanding of the gut-lung axis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research development plan is designed to provide the candidate, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and neonatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the mentorship, training and research experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist in neonatal mucosal immunology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of leading a productive translational research program focused on understanding mucosal immunology in BPD and facilitate his transition to independence, the candidate and his established mentors have devised a comprehensive development plan based on: 1) intensive, personal mentorship from a team with a proven history of productive mentoring; 2) in-depth experiential and focused didactic training to advance his understanding of molecular mycology, gnotobiotics and clinical research methods; and 3) an innovative research plan to produce causal evidence for gut mycobiome involvement in BPD development. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a focused path to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist who will have a lasting impact on neonatal mucosal immunology.  BPD is the most serious pulmonary complication of preterm birth. Treatments to modify developmental risk factors for BPD are lacking. Neonatal models of the gut-lung axis in other lung diseases, epidemiological studies linking antibiotic exposure with increased risk of BPD development, and the candidate’s extensive preliminary studies in mice and preterm newborns strongly suggest the gut mycobiome represents a therapeutic target to influence BPD development. This proposal builds on the candidate’s prior experience and the expertise of his mentors to explore the mechanisms of the neonatal gut-lung axis. We will test two hypotheses. 1) Prenatal antibiotic exposure-induced mycobiome changes drive increased BPD severity by disrupting the gut-lung axis. 2) Colonization with commensal fungi favorably alters the pulmonary mucosal immune response to hyperoxia. Determining if disruption of intestinal commensal microbial communities contributes to the development of lung injury in BPD will inform the development of therapeutics for mitigating BPD. These studies are expected to lay the groundwork translational studies in human preterm newborns. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a devastating chronic lung disease with debilitating long-term consequences, affects approximately half of all infants born extremely preterm. The objectives of this proposal are relevant to public health because they aim to establish that bacterial communities in the gut influence development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by altering the immune responses of the developing lung. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into extra-pulmonary contributions to lung development and characterize new targets for therapy, which addresses goals of the NIH to seek mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in the pathobiology of lung diseases and reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease during early life.",The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,9952647,K08HL151907,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alabama', 'Antibiotics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Education', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mucosal Immune Responses', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pediatrics', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career development', 'critical developmental period', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fungus', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-lung axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'lung development', 'lung injury', 'member', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'neonatal period', 'neonate', 'new therapeutic target', 'pneumonia model', 'pre-clinical', 'prenatal', 'preterm newborn', 'professor', 'protective effect', 'pulmonary function', 'research and development', 'respiratory microbiome', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'translational research program', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K08,2020,165456,0.015694547430029265
"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance ABSTRACT  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history, lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung cancer screening. Project Narrative: We propose to investigate the role of the macro-vasculature surrounding indeterminate lung nodules depicted on CT images to discriminate screen-detected benign and malignant nodules. The goal is to improve lung cancer screening by reducing the number of unnecessary procedure associate the high rate of false positive detections.",Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance,9883874,R01CA237277,"['Administrator', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Colon', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking History', 'Spiculate', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chest computed tomography', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'demographics', 'density', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'longitudinal database', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,415606,0.0970500544164228
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9852338,K23HL130641,"['Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bacteria', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early treatment', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Enterobacter', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epinephrine', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immigration', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-linear Models', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pseudomonas', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'bacteriome', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical development', 'clinical risk', 'cytokine', 'dysbiosis', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'respiratory microbiome', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2020,172800,0.03417743060022286
"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for therapy.",Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis,9892329,K08HL146943,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Drug Exposure', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,163296,0.05282804545423837
"Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions Project Summary  The goal of this project is to further develop an existing smart stethoscope in order to be capable of monitoring pediatric patients at home who suffer from asthma as well as adults with COPD. Lung diseases impose a serious burden on healthcare systems, individuals and governments. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) ranked third and fourth as the leading causes of death in 2016, each claiming 3 million lives annually. LRIs accounted for 14.9% of pediatric deaths, making it the leading cause of infant mortality after pre-term birth. Asthma—a condition for which, like COPD, there is no cure—is also the leading chronic disease in children and an estimated 235 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, with over 380,000 deaths from the disease in 2015. Asthma and COPD costed the United States approximately $56 billion and $72 billion last year, respectively. The burden of these diseases and the health disparities across populations is only slated to get worse in the coming decade, as respiratory diseases are expected to increase by 155% due to an aging population and increased pollution, while there is expected to a large shortage of pulmonary specialists, with an expect 7% decline by 2030.  We reasoned that a long-term monitoring solution that can be used in the home by untrained patients, or family members of patients, that could detect and monitor severity of airway inflammation in patients, provide insight into reasons for worsening or improved symptoms, push tailored educational content, and direct patients to medical follow before the situation becomes acute, would empower patients with chronic conditions while also reducing trips to emergency departments and readmission rates to hospitals. We find that several challenges exist when considering long term auscultatory monitoring solutions in non-traditional clinical settings: (1) unpredictable ambient noise, (2) the need for medical expertise to interpret lung sounds, (3) subjectivity in the analysis, and (4) difficulty using and placing the stethoscope. The research team developed a smart stethoscope that was originally intended for use in low-resource countries by community health workers to differentiate between pediatric patients with crackles and wheezes that overcomes many of these challenges. This smart stethoscope address all the challenges above by including (1) adaptive noise suppression that has been objectively and subjectively proven to be superior in all types of noise environments than traditional or other electronic stethoscopes, (2) on-board analysis algorithms that can detect crackles and wheezes in pediatric patients with an accuracy that matches that of a specialist, and (3) a uniform pickup surface that removes the requirement for exact placement of the device to get an accurate recording. In this project, we will validate that the device can be correctly used by parents of children with asthma and accurate recordings can be taken that are similar in quality to those that would be taken by a medical professional. Simultaneously, we will be using patient feedback to iterate on the device and mobile app design to create a version that patients are comfortable using in their home. Once the device and app have been validated in Phase I, we plan to move into directly into Phase II where the device will enter in a second phase of investigation that will include a first-time longitudinal study from parents of pediatric patients taking daily recordings in their home. This data will then be used for the development of algorithms to determine lung sound severities with metrics that can be tracked and predicted over time. In parallel to the this clinical study and algorithm development, recordings will be taken of adult patients with COPD to expand the usability of the device beyond pediatrics. Project Narrative This proposal aims to validate a smart auscultation device for home use and develop algorithms that can track changes in, and severity of, lung sounds in order to monitor patients over long periods of time, improve the clinical relevance of home monitoring for timely interventions, and decrease hospital admissions. Current state of the art technology available to patients suffering from asthma and COPD is unable to intelligently monitor patients at home and no long-term monitoring solutions exist for these conditions, resulting in increases in emergency department visits. The academic partner has developed a smart stethoscope that offers greatly improved audio fidelity in any type of noise environment, automated on-board analysis and detection algorithms of lung sounds, and increased ease of use. The small business partner is in the process of commercializing the device for clinical use by trained, professional personnel. Together, we are aiming to test whether the device can be reliably used by non-trained personnel for home use, develop algorithms that would provide metrics for monitoring trends and severities of lung sounds and predict future severity, expand the current abilities of the stethoscope from pediatrics to all patients, and transfer this technology to the small business partner for further clinical testing and commercial development such that it can improve the long-term outcome for patients with chronic lung conditions.",Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions,9909859,R42HL147728,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auditory', 'Auscultation', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Community Health Aides', 'Cost of Illness', 'Country', 'Crackles', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Stethoscopes', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untrained Personnel', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'aging population', 'airway inflammation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy trial', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'pediatric patients', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatic improvement', 'trend', 'usability']",NHLBI,"SONAVI LABS, INC.",R42,2020,236489,-0.02294523805908293
