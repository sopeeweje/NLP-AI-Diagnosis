"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry.

"Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes Summary/Abstract Real world scenes contain a wealth of information that guide where we look and help us search for things in our visual environment more efficiently. For example, if you were looking for a person in a city, you would look mostly on the sidewalk, whereas if you were looking for a car, you would concentrate your attention on the street. Despite the fact that behavioral experiments have increasingly quantified the role of object and scene knowledge in the guidance of attention and eye movements, models of these processes, particularly neural models, neglect the role of visual knowledge. The goal of this project is to determine whether regions of the brain shown to be important for object and scene recognition are involved in visual guidance in natural scenes. Prior results, including our preliminary data, show that the neural activity from object processing regions can be used to predict what object a person is going to look at next. However, critical questions that remain are: is this predictive activity influenced by scene and object knowledge and is it causally related to visual guidance? Answering these two questions are the specific goals of this proposal. Individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy provide the rare opportunity of recording directly from the human brain (intracranial electroencephalography, iEEG), which provides a superior spatial and temporal resolution measure of brain activity compared to other technique. These direct recordings also allow for electrical brain stimulation (EBS), which can provide causal evidence tying the activity in particular regions to cognitive function. Finally, these data will be supplemented by magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to examine whole brain effects in healthy individuals. iEEG and MEG data arising from regions involved in object and scene recognition will be analyzed by multivariate machine learning techniques to continually classify what subjects are viewing on a moment-to- moment basis. Furthermore, we will try to predict what object subjects will view next during free viewing and visual search in natural scenes based on their neural data. We will assess how these neural signals are modified by the presence or absence of information about typical locations of objects or people in the scene that have been shown to guide behavior. Finally, using EBS we will determine if there is a causal link between the activity in regions involved in coding for object and scene knowledge and visual guidance in natural scene vision. If successful, these studies would necessitate a substantial reshaping of models of visual attention in the human brain. The results could form the foundation of a program of research into the neural basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world. Attention, perception, and eye movement abnormalities are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, these studies, and the models that arise from them, have the translational potential to advance our understanding of the neurological basis of these disorders and suggest potential neurally inspired rehabilitation strategies. Narrative Abnormalities in visual attention and eye movement guidance are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including visual agnosia, neglect, schizophrenia, autism, etc. The neural basis of visual attention and eye movement guidance in the real world is unknown; therefore it remains unknown how neural abnormalities in these disorders relate to real world visual deficits, which is a critical barrier to designing hypothesis-driven remediation strategies. The proposed research will take critical early steps towards understanding the neural basis of real world attention and eye movement control, which has the potential to transform our understanding of these critical visual processes. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of eye movement and attentional guidance, a circuit relevant to a number of disorders, and take a critical step towards developing hypotheses for remediation strategies.",Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes,9830940,R21EY030297,"['Agnosia', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Object Attachment', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Walking', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'computer monitor', 'design', 'experimental study', 'neglect', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'programs', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spatial relationship', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2019,234750,0.28504744009769706

"Deciding Where to Look Next: Frontal Eye Field's Role during Natural Viewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to understand how the brain decides where we look in the real world. Many factors influence our eye movements (saccades). For instance, we are more likely to look at salient objects (i.e. those that are conspicuous), such as a bright red balloon in a blue sky. We are also more likely to look at goal-dependent objects (i.e. those that share features with our goals), such as a yellow object when searching for a banana. For several decades, researchers in computer vision have been developing models based on these factors to predict the locations to which we move our eyes. Researchers in neurobiology have also been studying saccade selection, and have suggested the frontal eye field (FEF) plays a large role, as the FEF encodes both visual features and eye movements. But because the FEF encodes both visual features and saccades, it is very difficult to parse FEF activity during natural viewing. For this reason, past experiments have primarily investigated the FEF using simple, constrained tasks with artificial stimuli. In this project, I wil use images of natural scenes, which better approximate the complexity of the real world. I will record with extracellular electrodes from the FEF of awake, behaving rhesus monkeys, while they view natural scenes. In order to determine the FEF's role in the decision of where to saccade next in natural scenes, I will investigate how the FEF encodes visual features that predict saccades. In my two aims, I will test how the FEF encodes salience (Aim 1) and goal-dependence (Aim 2). I will build a model that explains neural activity using visual features (salience and goal-dependence) along with eye movements, which are a confounding source of neural activity. This model will take advantage of computer vision and machine learning algorithms in order to look at the effects of large numbers of correlates and visual features in these natural scenes. The neural data analysis methods developed for these aims will allow researchers that study many brain areas to more easily use natural scenes. Additionally, understanding how the brain chooses where to saccade in natural scenes have important consequences for neurologic and psychiatric health and disease. Several diseases including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's impair the choice of saccades. A better understanding of the link between visual features, eye movements, and FEF activity promises to increase understanding of these diseases and allow the development of novel diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to understand how the frontal eye field cortex helps determine where we look. In particular, it will investigate how the frontal eye field cortex encodes visual stimuli that drive eye movements, such as salient and important objects. Eye movement decisions are impaired in many diseases, including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's, and this research could help lead to a greater understanding of these diseases and the development of novel diagnostic tools.",Deciding Where to Look Next: Frontal Eye Field's Role during Natural Viewing,9266417,F31EY025532,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Play', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'frontal eye fields', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2017,35657,0.2740135324391775

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""

"Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes The overall goal of these experiments is to understand how the brain controls where we look. To accomplish this, it is important to study brain activity and behavior under conditions that closely approximate those in the real world. All of the experiments we propose to do will use awake behaving rhesus monkeys as subjects. In prior work, we have studied activity in the cortical frontal eye field while monkeys looked at images of natural scenes. The frontal eye field (FEF) is closely involved in the control of purposive voluntary eye movements. While the monkey searched for a target hidden in the images of natural scenes, the activity of FEF neurons consisted of combinations of activity related to planning upcoming eye movements, as well as activity that was sensitive to salient visual features of the image. In parallel with the development of our understanding of how the brain controls eye movements, there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the features of natural images that guide both human and monkey eye movements. These behavioral studies are at the advanced level of being able to accurately predict patterns of eye movements. Our goal in this proposal is to take advantage of these advancements in predicting patterns of eye movements in natural environments to help us understand the brain events that are responsible for this behavior. We will focus upon neuron activity in the FEF due to its essential role in the control of voluntary eye movements. The proposal has 3 Aims each focused upon a different factor that is known to guide eye movements under natural conditions. Salience describes how different a small part of a visual scene is from the remainder of the scene based upon stimulus features such as color, contrast, shape, and orientation. Our first aim will define the effects that salience has upon FEF activity. In our second aim, we'll quantify the effects of relevance. Relevance refers to the importance of visual features for the task at hand; for example, if we're looking for a red target, the red items in the image will be more likely to attract our attention and ultimately be the target for an eye movement. Knowing the broad composition of a scene, a quality that is called scene gist, can tell us the places where an object is more likely to be found. For example, if we are looking for a bicycle, we are more likely to search the sidewalks and roadways of a street scene and ignore other places where bicycles are unlikely to be found. Our final aim will look for the effects of scene gist upon monkey behavior and the FEF activity driving that behavior. In addition to the brain recording experiments outlined above, a large part of our effort will be devoted to mathematical analysis and modeling of the behavioral and neuronal data we obtain. Our ultimate goal is to provide a model that predicts the contributions of salience, relevance, and gist to the activity of FEF neurons. The successful model will be a mathematical representation that predicts search-related activity in the FEF for both artificial and real world conditions. Due to the known and expected similarities between monkey and human eye movement systems, these experiments provide a model for the functional organization of frontal eye field cortex in humans. The ability to make appropriate eye movements is a function that can be damaged by a number of diseases, including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Schizophrenia. More specifically, deficits in the proper control of fixation during search of complex visual stimuli have been described in patients suffering from simultanagnosia, as well as in individuals with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.",Neural Mechanisms of Fixation Choice while Searching Natural Scenes,8822295,R01EY021579,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory area', 'Banana', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye Movements', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'frontal eye fields', 'image guided', 'interest', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'mind control', 'neuromechanism', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,376478,0.3191924130966713

"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments.

"Visual statistical learning in human infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program of research is to determine how the developing human infant forms representations of the visual world. The focus of the research is on a class of powerful learning mechanisms that have been shown by the Principal Investigator and his colleagues to rapidly extract from sequences of auditory stimuli the statistical properties that form coherent units (e.g., words and melodies). Visual statistical learning will be studied to determine whether a similarly powerful set of mechanisms is present in a modality other than audition. Infants ranging in age from 3- to 12-months of age, as well as adults, will be tested on a variety of statistical learning tasks in which small visual shapes are arranged into scenes. At issue is how infants and adults learn that some of these shapes appear together (co-occur) across many different scenes, forming the basic building blocks for representing those scenes in memory. Four different techniques will be used with infants. The primary technique involves the repeated presentation of a sequence of 16-28 different scenes composed of 3-6 different shapes. After a decline in looking time (habituation) to these displays, infants will be presented with test displays containing coherent (high statistical relatedness) and incoherent (unrelated) shapes that were embedded in the scenes. The other three techniques involve forced-choice preferential looking, automated corneal reflection eye-tracking, and anticipatory eye-movements to learned categories. These techniques will be used to determine whether newly learned features activate attention in cluttered scenes, how these features are learned when low-level properties of the scenes compete for attention, how variations over time in the input statistics affect the accuracy of feature learning, and how other perceptual constraints affect feature learning. A key hypothesis of the Pl's statistical approach will be tested -- that learners represent the largest coherent unit in a complex array of elements, rather than also representing all of the embedded elements that are redundant with this larger unit. Taken together, these proposed studies will reveal how infants and adults learn new information from complex visual scenes and represent that information in a computationally efficient manner. Failure to learn efficiently could lead to deficits in the early phases of learning in infancy and negatively affect the formation of higher level categories.         n/a",Visual statistical learning in human infants,7173447,R01HD037082,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Clutterings', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cornea', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'detector', 'infancy', 'object perception', 'programs', 'research study', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'visual control', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2007,230302,0.1387300426442614
"Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes Project Summary Real-world scenes contain far more information than we can perceive at any given moment. Scene perception therefore requires attentional selection of relevant scene regions for prioritized processing. How are those aspects of the world that should receive priority selected? Although much past research has focused on how attention is guided by the visual properties of a scene, new evidence from meaning maps, developed in the previous funding period, established that the distribution of meaning across a scene plays a central and often dominant role in guiding attention. This surprising finding raises many important new questions about the nature of scene meaning and its specific role in attentional guidance. The overarching goal of this project is to understand in detail how the semantic features of a scene’s objects and functional spaces influence the guidance of visual attention in complex real-world scenes. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the role of object semantics in attentional guidance in scenes; (2) To determine the role of functional spaces in attentional guidance in scenes; (3) To determine how viewing task interacts with scene semantics in guiding attention. The project is innovative in expanding the traditional study of attention to explicitly consider the role of meaning. To this end, new semantic maps capitalizing on the meaning map concept will be used capture local region meaning continuously over a scene, allowing for direct investigation of the relationships of different types of meaning with attention. The project is innovative in (1) expanding the traditional study of visual attention to explicitly consider the role of semantics; (2) focusing on the semantics of both scene content (objects) and scene structure (space); (3) considering the role of meaning in attentional guidance in the context of viewing task; (4) integrating the use of a wide variety of cognitive science methods marshalled in the service of understanding the influence of meaning on visual attention in real-world scenes, including eyetracking, large-scale crowd-sourcing, computational image processing, computational semantic modeling, and deep convolutional neural networks. The project is significant in challenging current models of visual attention to account for the role of scene meaning. Because the proposed studies test competing models, the results will lead to the development of integrative theoretical frameworks that advance the field regardless of the outcome. While focused on basic science, the studies have potentially important translational implications by providing a more complete characterization of the processes associated with visual attention. The proposed studies may ultimately lead to the development of rehabilitation strategies for visual attention as it operates in the real world, better capitalizing on the use of a viewer’s knowledge to offset disrupted functions in those with attention and vision deficits. Project Narrative The visual world presents us with far more information than we can process at any given moment. How does the brain select those aspects of the world that should receive priority for visual analysis? This project investigates how we select and attend to meaningful information the natural environment given what we are currently trying to accomplish. The studies combine high-resolution eyetracking with models of meaning based on crowd-sourced human ratings, computer vision models of image processing, deep learning models of scene recognition and attention, and hybrid artificial intelligence models of complex concepts. The role of meaning in guiding attention is contrasted with the role of pre-semantic image features. The knowledge gained will increase our theoretical understanding of how visual attention and perception operate in complex meaningful scenes, assist in the identification of individuals with deficits in visual attention, and may ultimately lead to the development of targeted rehabilitation strategies for the real world.",Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes,10049970,R01EY027792,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Esthetics', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Marshal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior test', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'image processing', 'imaging properties', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'visual information', 'visual search']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,381403,0.2605437386409587
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9910403,R01EY026042,"['3-Dimensional', '4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'support vector machine', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,306185,0.447677881576164
"Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes Summary/Abstract Real world scenes contain a wealth of information that guide where we look and help us search for things in our visual environment more efficiently. For example, if you were looking for a person in a city, you would look mostly on the sidewalk, whereas if you were looking for a car, you would concentrate your attention on the street. Despite the fact that behavioral experiments have increasingly quantified the role of object and scene knowledge in the guidance of attention and eye movements, models of these processes, particularly neural models, neglect the role of visual knowledge. The goal of this project is to determine whether regions of the brain shown to be important for object and scene recognition are involved in visual guidance in natural scenes. Prior results, including our preliminary data, show that the neural activity from object processing regions can be used to predict what object a person is going to look at next. However, critical questions that remain are: is this predictive activity influenced by scene and object knowledge and is it causally related to visual guidance? Answering these two questions are the specific goals of this proposal. Individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy provide the rare opportunity of recording directly from the human brain (intracranial electroencephalography, iEEG), which provides a superior spatial and temporal resolution measure of brain activity compared to other technique. These direct recordings also allow for electrical brain stimulation (EBS), which can provide causal evidence tying the activity in particular regions to cognitive function. Finally, these data will be supplemented by magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to examine whole brain effects in healthy individuals. iEEG and MEG data arising from regions involved in object and scene recognition will be analyzed by multivariate machine learning techniques to continually classify what subjects are viewing on a moment-to- moment basis. Furthermore, we will try to predict what object subjects will view next during free viewing and visual search in natural scenes based on their neural data. We will assess how these neural signals are modified by the presence or absence of information about typical locations of objects or people in the scene that have been shown to guide behavior. Finally, using EBS we will determine if there is a causal link between the activity in regions involved in coding for object and scene knowledge and visual guidance in natural scene vision. If successful, these studies would necessitate a substantial reshaping of models of visual attention in the human brain. The results could form the foundation of a program of research into the neural basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world. Attention, perception, and eye movement abnormalities are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, these studies, and the models that arise from them, have the translational potential to advance our understanding of the neurological basis of these disorders and suggest potential neurally inspired rehabilitation strategies. Narrative Abnormalities in visual attention and eye movement guidance are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including visual agnosia, neglect, schizophrenia, autism, etc. The neural basis of visual attention and eye movement guidance in the real world is unknown; therefore it remains unknown how neural abnormalities in these disorders relate to real world visual deficits, which is a critical barrier to designing hypothesis-driven remediation strategies. The proposed research will take critical early steps towards understanding the neural basis of real world attention and eye movement control, which has the potential to transform our understanding of these critical visual processes. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of eye movement and attentional guidance, a circuit relevant to a number of disorders, and take a critical step towards developing hypotheses for remediation strategies.",Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes,10004653,R21EY030297,"['Agnosia', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Object Attachment', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Walking', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'computer monitor', 'design', 'experimental study', 'neglect', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'programs', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spatial relationship', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search', 'visual tracking']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,195625,0.28504744009769706
