"Mobile Peer Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal develops a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with opioid use disorders (OUDs). The majority of individuals with OUDs in the United States do not receive any formal substance use treatment, and growing evidence suggests that many OUD patients turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related information about addiction and recovery. While engagement with peers before and during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery programs, commonly-used online social platforms (e.g. Reddit) lack effective content moderation, with inappropriate messages ranging from misinformed advice to maliciousness. This lack of oversight precludes a deeper integration of peer support and clinical care. Our mobile platform allows patients to access a tailored support group 24/7, and is augmented with AI tools capable of understanding the emotional sentiment in messages, automatically `flagging' critical or clinically relevant content, creating a scalable system to keep groups safe and constructive. This phase I proposal demonstrates the robustness of these AI tools by adapting them to catch OUD-specific `flags' in peer messages while also examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients. A subsequent phase II proposal will test tailored, real-time interventions to `flags', allowing the commercialization of a system to harness the engagement and self-disclosure of peer groups in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE The widespread and chronic nature of opioid use disorder (OUD) necessitates investment in highly scalable technology solutions. Our work has the potential to dramatically broaden access to care for patients, particularly those in highly stigmatized and rural communities, while taking an entirely novel approach to patient triaging and tracking through artificial intelligence technology. Such technology has the potential to enable new modalities of treatment and lays the foundation for a more cost-effective, yet personalized, approach to chronic OUD care.",Mobile Peer Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool,9679778,R41DA047837,"['Adopted', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Self Disclosure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stigmatization', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'addiction', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health intervention', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'peer', 'peer support', 'personalized approach', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'social', 'social stigma', 'standard care', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"BEACON TECH, INC.",R41,2019,225000,0.03918503227622733
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9727956,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'classification trees', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,588500,0.24984685951226598
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,9885663,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Traction', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2019,206139,0.06708791508773494
"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies.

"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9721752,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,203040,0.1297244582146594
"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship.

"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. ! Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,9912034,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2019,225000,0.20452989376019384

"Remote vital sign and opioid overdose detection via a non-invasive wearable sensing patch PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Approximately 2 million Americans are living with an opioid use disorder, and in 2017, 17,029 people overdosed on prescription opioids. Opioids cause respiratory depression; however, fatal overdose usually occurs over a period of 1–3 hours, leaving a window of opportunity to intervene with the inexpensive drug naloxone, an opioid antagonist, that can reverse the effects of opioids, quickly restoring normal respiration rates. VivaLNK proposes to enhance the currently marketed Vital Scout wellness wearable sensing patch for use in people at risk for opioid overdose, by detecting physiologic indicators of an opioid overdose (slow respiration rate, low heart rate and low blood pressure), and the ability to send a potentially life-saving overdose alert, which could be received by an emergency contact/caregiver and hasten treatment with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Health monitoring emergency notification systems that can remotely monitor patient vital signs for indications of deterioration and send a potentially life-saving alert to emergency contacts/caregivers, have the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatal opioid overdoses in the US. The Vital Scout patch is already strategically positioned to monitor overdose parameters utilizing the built in ECG sensor to continuously register waveforms from which respiration rate, heart rate, heart rate variability, and activity are calculated. While several devices are currently being developed for overdose alerts, the Vital Scout is the only alert which has the potential to capture the three critical vital signs indicative of an overdose, and simultaneously monitor physical activity, providing additional context to the vital signs data. The vital signs collected by the Vital Scout patch are based on a machine-learning algorithm which we propose to further develop by the following specific aims: 1) Refinement and optimization of the Vital Scout to incorporate an overdose algorithm with an alert function by improving the sensitivity in order to detect lower respiration and heart rate indicative of a potential overdose. 2) Expand the sensing capabilities of the Vital Scout system to include blood pressure monitoring. The algorithm will be optimized using three volunteer cohorts (~20/ cohort) (i) healthy volunteers, (ii) elderly patients over the age of 65 (more likely to have low BP due to medically-induced hypotension) and (iii) low BP patients (represented by elite student-athletes). Data from these cohorts will provide the initial broad range of data for the machine-learning linear regression algorithm. We will assess whether these are appropriate designations for providing accurate blood pressure measurements, similar to what is seen within the opioid population. Meeting all of these goals will result in an enhanced Vital Scout that will be the most sensitive device for opioid overdose detection to remotely monitor the vital signs of people addicted to opioids and those at-risk for opioid overdose, including but not limited to, people with pulmonary disease or those taking antidepressants.

"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose. Abstract More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdose in 2016 and drug overdose is now the most common cause of death for people under 50 years old in the United States. Furthermore, the number of overdose deaths is increasing with the rise of abuse of powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. In May of 2017 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) directors Drs. Collins and Volkow outlined how research may help reduce the death toll associated with the current opioid epidemic; one of the current critical needs is the development of new overdose-reversal interventions, including wearable technologies that can detect an (impending) overdose from physiological signals to signal for help, or trigger a coupled automated injection of naloxone. Automated detection of overdose is essential because most opioid overdoses occur when individuals are alone and unobserved by family members or first responders. Opioids cause respiration to slow and become irregular due to mu-opioid receptor mediated suppression of respiratory related regions of the brainstem and spinal cord. Importantly, there are characteristic early changes in breathing pattern that indicate a progression towards significant hypoventilation, but there is currently no easy-to –use method or device to measure these patterns non-invasively. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in respiratory monitoring using tracheal sounds. Tracheal sounds originate from the vibrations of the tracheal wall and surrounding soft tissues caused by gas pressure fluctuations in the trachea. These sounds can be collected from a microphone placed over the trachea and analyzed to determine the real-time respiratory rate and an estimate of respiratory flow and tidal volume. We hypothesize that individual trends in tracheal sounds detected by a machine- learning algorithm will provide an early warning sign of the onset of hypoventilation as a result of opioid overdose in humans. The aims of this proposal are to develop a machine learning algorithm that detects impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose and to develop an initial design for a miniature wireless tracheal sound sensor. Project Narrative RTM Vital Signs, LLC is developing a non-invasive Tracheal Sound Sensor for early detection of impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose. The sensor will continuously monitor an individual’s respiratory pattern to detect a significant change from baseline, in which case it will contact a caregiver and/or emergency personnel detailing the location and status of the person experiencing an opioid overdose or initiate a coupled naloxone injection. This technology has the potential to prevent a significant number of deaths as a result of opioid overdose by allowing for the timely detection of hypoventilation and administration of naloxone.",Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose.,9680488,R41DA047779,"['Abdomen', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Body Patterning', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Engineering', 'Environmental air flow', 'Family member', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hypercapnic respiratory failure', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Snoring', 'Sorbus', 'Spinal Cord', 'Study Subject', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Thick', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Trachea', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'alertness', 'base', 'body position', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microphone', 'mu opioid receptors', 'notch protein', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'synthetic opioid', 'time use', 'trend', 'vibration', 'volunteer', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"RTM VITAL SIGNS, LLC",R41,2019,236381,0.19013089534019256
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9666315,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2019,188575,0.2353633041884658
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9625118,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2019,162123,0.007184592419514742
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9416993,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,537201,0.18102626124337107
"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9688964,R21DA045969,"['21 year old', 'Abstinence', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Link', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Opioid', 'Oxycodone', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid misuse', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,251250,0.10812988240777024
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,702420,0.08833776884747294
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9835697,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,735192,0.12548527088989497
"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients.

"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY The misuse of opioids, opioid addiction and overdose are a serious national public health crisis—the opioid epidemic—that despite increased scientific, clinical and government attention, continues to grow. Methadone is a generally effective treatment for opioid use disorder, however relapse rates remain high, and risk of overdose is greatest during relapse. There is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid relapse to improve our understanding of opioid use disorder and its treatment. Using connectome-based methods (i.e., functional connectivity) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recently identified a large-scale brain network that predicted opioid relapse from both resting and task states. Connectome-based methods enable data-driven characterization of whole brain networks related to behavior that might be better suited to describe complex clinical phenomena (e.g., opioid relapse). Building on prior work indicating the utility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to test brain activation patterns related to specific functions and individual abilities to regulate these functions, the proposed project will use connectome-based neurofeedback to target patterns of functional connectivity within our recently identified “opioid abstinence network”. This information is critical to improve understanding of mechanisms of opioid relapse. Individuals on methadone will be randomized to receive either active (n=12) or sham (n=12) connectome-based neurofeedback at 3 weekly scanning sessions including feedback and transfer runs. Additional baseline and follow-up scans will include resting state and reward and cognitive task runs. Craving, negative affect and opioid use will be measured weekly and at 1-mo follow-up. Based on our pilot data, connectome-based feedback will be targeted at the opioid abstinence network and we hypothesize that increased connectivity in this network will be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with reduced opioid use from baseline to follow-up scans (Aim 1a) and at 1-mo follow- up (Aim 1b). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with increased opioid abstinence network connectivity in resting state (Aim 2a) and task (reward, cognitive) state (Aim 2b) versus sham feedback, as in our pilot work. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with greater improvements in clinical features of opioid use disorder (craving, negative affect) than sham feedback (Aim 3a) and that increased opioid abstinence network connectivity will correlate with these improvements (Aim 3b). Overall, this project tests a potentially transformative hypothesis relating large-scale brain network dynamics to outcomes in opioid use disorder, and tests a highly innovative method for real-time fMRI neurofeedback from the opioid abstinence network to improve clinical features of opioid use disorder. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the functional neurobiology of opioid relapse and more generally has the potential to transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project leverages advances in real-time fMRI neurofeedback and machine learning to test whether methadone-treated individuals with opioid use disorder can increase functional connectivity within an empirically-derived “opioid abstinence network” that has previously been identified to predict opioid relapse. This project will provide critical data and information to improve our understanding of opioid relapse and may transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions more generally.

"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",9817054,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,718669,0.1336004944366817
"4/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches  for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000.

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9883361,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,135653,0.10571862941688939

"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9547370,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,585626,0.24984685951226598
"Project FIGARO - Factors Important to Gather for Anticipating Relapses for Opioids PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) the propensity for relapse is high when experiencing craving, independent of a desire to stay sober. Historically, tools to fight opioid addiction have been limited and retrospective. By the time a traditional intervention occurs, they are often already reusing. Addiction relapses too often lead to a costly downward spiral - committing crimes, getting rearrested, being hospitalized, overdosing, and/or dying. Recent advances in wearable sensors, smartphones and artificial intelligence have created an unprecedented opportunity to produce positive health outcomes by predicting and preventing OUD relapses and overdoses. With sensing and associated algorithms, it will be possible to detect relapse risk states and intervene in advance - before a relapse actually occurs. The first step in this new era of proactive opioid relapse prediction is to identify and measure digital biomarkers associated with reinitiating drug use and relapse and implement a predictive model with minimal false positive alerts to achieve just-in-time intervention. This will begin with the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on patients and healthcare professionals to identify desired features and functions. Behaivior LLC will develop a relapse prevention platform that will consider a combination of physiological sensor data from the patient’s wearable devices in combination with smartphone usage data, location data and – importantly – reports from people in his/her support network to identify and detect relapse triggers in real-time. SA-1​: Demonstrate what makes a wrist wearable device acceptable and usable for people with OUD. SA-2.A​: Identify positive correlations between physiological, location and smartphone data, and self-reported opioid cravings: ​Results will be used to create a predictive model that can operate in real-time. SA-2.B​: Demonstrate feasibility of using support-network-reported data to predict opioid cravings. SA-3​: Create a predictive model to anticipate opioid relapse as a step towards just-in-time intervention. SA-4​: Demonstrate feasibility of predictive model by obtaining a sufficiently low false positive rate. A successful outcome of this project will be a wearables platform capable of predicting and preventing opioid addiction relapses, stemming the tide of the opioid epidemic. The platform will be ready for regulatory approvals and integration into existing electronic health records and monitoring systems. To achieve behavior modification, Behaivior will implement and commercialize a wearables platform and suite of effective interventions utilizing individualized, active machine learning, and continued iteration of next generation wearables and supporting mobile applications. ​A​ robust platform prototype capable of producing measurable change will be tested. Further development of the most promising MVP(s) will be pursued by a Phase II SBIR proposal. Project Narrative Knowing in real­time when someone with opioid use disorder is at a high risk of relapsing will revolutionize the ability to intervene at the right moment to help people stay clean and sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high­risk opioid craving/obsession state, and will enable the creation of a predictive model for just­in­time intervention.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9427988,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2018,162800,0.007184592419514742
"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered.

"Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success The United States has experienced a four-fold increase in medical opioid use over the last two  decades. Medical opioid abuse and addiction have increased and afflict 5% and 2% of US adults  respectively; heroin addiction afflicts 0.5% of US adults. In 2016, >39,000 US individuals died of  a medical opioid, illicit opiate or synthetic opioid overdose, an increase of 18% from 2015. While  opioid addiction treatment admissions and treatment capacity have increased many-fold over the last  two decades, patient needs greatly exceed capacity. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) approaches for opioid use disorder include three approved  pharmacotherapies combined with psychosocial and supportive therapies. Active investigations are  evaluating established and novel therapies for opioid detoxification prior to MAT. MATs have  established but limited efficacy in treating opioid use disorders compared to placebo  pharmacotherapy. Patients treated with MATs have mortality rates during and after treatment that  exceed population mortality rates. Improving efficacy through personalized treatment is essential  to optimize MAT resources and reduce mortality. “Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success” offers a data science solution that aligns  with NIDA priorities and Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidance to expand use of MAT, and with HHS  priorities to support cutting edge research on pain and addiction. Our overall aim is to decode the  predictors of MAT success and enable health care providers to improve treatment efficacy using  accurate forecasting. In Aim 1, we will create a platform for applying learning algorithms to existing and future opioid  addiction treatment data. We will organize and merge clinical, treatment, and outcome variables  from clinical trials of opioid addiction treatment publicly available through the NIDA Data Share  resource. We will import these data into a database optimized for high dimensional data analysis.  Workflows will be developed to apply multiple Bayesian learning algorithms to the data. In Aim 2,  using the biosignature learning platform, we will identify sets of variables that together predict  opioid addiction treatment success. We will apply this platform to each trial independently, and  then to multiple trials in an integrative analysis. The learned biosignatures will be ranked by how  well they predict treatment success. The best models will be incorporated into a proof-of-concept calculator. The calculator will provide treatment success scores based on the  characteristics of new patients. We will present the prototype to multiple stakeholders for  assessment. At the end of Phase I, we will have created a biosignature learning platform and a proof-of-concept  opioid addiction treatment success calculator. We plan to fully develop these components with  additional datasets and variables in Phase II. Our commercial goal is to develop licensable and  easily deployable algorithms for healthcare networks treating opioid addiction. The algorithm will  help providers understand profiles of patients likely to be successful with MAT and to personalize  treatment strategies to maximize abstinence. In this project, we are using algorithms to learn the predictors of opioid addiction treatment  success from publicly available clinical trial data.

"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9507053,R21DA045969,"['21 year old', 'Abstinence', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Link', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Opioid', 'Oxycodone', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Spin Labels', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'connectome', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid misuse', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209375,0.10812988240777024
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,724280,0.08833776884747294
"Development of a secure, cloud-based platform to improve record linkage & cross-agency collaboration for the public sector: using deep learning & scalable data integrations to combat the opioid crisis Project Summary/Abstract: This SBIR Phase I proposal aims to fund research and development for a new, multitenant secure cloud-based platform specifically tailored to provide local governmental agencies with tools to share datasets and link them accurately, at high quality and low cost. The OpenLattice platform will focus on reducing drug overdoses and making drug treatment less fractured. Individual-level datasets linked across medical providers and law enforcement can support analyses of prescribing pathways and treatment trajectories that precede opioid overdose, entry into treatment, disruption, and recovery. However, linking data at the individual level has proven to be a difficult and resource-intensive endeavor compared to use of aggregate-level data, with issues with deduplication plaguing many institutional databases. With 91 American deaths recorded daily from opioid overdoses and systems of care spread across multiple institutions, the need for greater and high-quality data sharing is undeniable. Our test partner for assessing the efficacy of proposed innovations is the Greater Portland Addiction Collaborative (GPAC) in Maine, a partnership of hospitals, a police department, jail, detox treatment centers and halfway houses already working together to reduce drug overdoses. This proposal aims to demonstrate proof of concept for (i) scaling high-quality data integrations across multiple governmental domains via a standardized entity data model, and (ii) improving record linkage using neural networks. Firstly, OpenLattice is developing an open source ontology and integration scripts to standardize integration of datasets into OpenLattice's database. As the individual customization requirements decline for onboarding customers and integrating new data into the platform, costs will be greatly slashed, removing a significant barrier to data solutions for smaller counties and cities across the country, who have historically faced custom integrations, system updates, data storage fees and add-ons at high cost. The OpenLattice platform also enables use of existing ETL tools and seamless integration with police dispatch systems, emergency medical calls, healthcare records, and online prescription systems across partners who have committed to data sharing and collaboration. Secondly, OpenLattice is developing a new, proprietary algorithm for record linkage that employs a promising but as-yet commercially untested technique: a multilayer perceptron neural network, more commonly known as deep learning. In pilot research, the linking algorithm has already demonstrated success rivaling—and sometimes exceeding—current state of the art linking technologies. In Phase I, OpenLattice will continue to improve ontologies, integration tools, and the deep learning neural network, and test on publicly available datasets with dissimilar data types and formats, with manual confirmation of results. When successful, these innovations will address critical barriers to improving clinical practice in treating opioid addiction by enabling a more comprehensive continuum of care for those in treatment. Project Narrative: Large-scale and coordinated responses to several of the US’s hot-button public health and criminal justice issues, such as the opioid epidemic and mass incarceration, are complicated by poor resource sharing and the US government’s highly fractured jurisdictional authority. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an efficient, scalable, cloud- based platform for hosting and linking highly sensitive state and local government databases at low cost, using (i) innovative data integration scripts and ontologies that standardize and scale capacity and (ii) technical advances in record de-duplication for linking databases. Data solutions would have tremendous societal impact on understandings of public health and the opioid epidemic by making drug treatment less fractured, saving lives and dramatically broadening contextual information, once data is broken out of silos.","Development of a secure, cloud-based platform to improve record linkage & cross-agency collaboration for the public sector: using deep learning & scalable data integrations to combat the opioid crisis",9622726,R43CE002937,[' '],NCIPC,"OPENLATTICE, INC.",R43,2018,225000,0.11561028607187152
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health 7. Project Summary Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose.  Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied.  In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff’s Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a “teachable moment” in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses.  The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). 8. Project Narrative Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim’s nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived.  This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff’s Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9688417,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,101470,0.10336965855842824
"eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of seizures and unintentional overdose fatalities related to illicit synthetic opioids in multiple states across the U.S. Submitted in response to NIDA PAR-16-055, Research Area 1 (Responses to sudden and severe emerging drug issues), this time-sensitive R21 application builds on interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Additions Research (CITAR) and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The overall purposes of the proposed study are to (a) characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends, and (b) identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) from three ""cryptomarkets"" located in the Deep Web. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Develop a semi-automated knowledge-based system, eDarkTrends, to collect and process data about illicit synthetic opioids supplied on cryptomarkets; 2a) Describe and monitor US-based supply trends of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets (e.g., trends in availability of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl analogs, U-47700, MT-45), including types of illicit synthetic opioids, prices, advertised purity, dosage and product forms, quantity supplied, and drug combinations; 2b) Identify new illicit synthetic opioid substances and product forms soon after they appear on cryptomarkets. The proposed study is significant because it will provide new information about illicit synthetic opioids and will identify new illicit synthetic opioids as soon as they appear on those markets. The key innovation is the development of a semi-automated system able to a) collect and analyze advertisement data from cryptomarkets and b) identify new emerging substances advertised on these markets. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study will collect and analyze data extracted from Deep Web cryptomarkets to characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends in the U.S, and will identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid-related terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) as soon as they appear on these markets. It will be the first system to apply semi-automated computational techniques to monitor the supply of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets. The findings will inform public health interventions and policy responses.",eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use,9487238,R21DA044518,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Area', 'Award', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computational Technique', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health Professional', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Infodemiology', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Liquid substance', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nose', 'Ohio', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Powder dose form', 'Prevention', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Seizures', 'Semantics', 'Sentinel', 'Side', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Transact', 'U-47700', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'carfentanil', 'design', 'dosage', 'drug market', 'drug testing', 'encryption', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'social media', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,184658,0.18614391192022106
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen these prevention efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of patient behaviors and clinical factors that increase overdose risk.",Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs,9498915,R01DA045816,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'American', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dizziness', 'Dose', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Fatigue', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'cost', 'drug testing', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'middle age', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'prescription opioid', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,649552,0.1275335970174975
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9421755,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,601139,0.24984685951226598
"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9266749,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phonation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,600547,0.18102626124337107
"Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Nationwide use of prescription opioids quadrupled to more than 240 million prescriptions per year between 1999 to 2010. This increase has been accompanied by an alarming rise in opioid misuse and abuse, addiction, and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. In response to this growing national epidemic, the Department of Health and Human Services has called for the creation of clear opioid prescribing guidelines and further developing the evidence base to guide opioid prescribing for the management of pain. To date, guidelines have largely focused on opioid use in younger adults despite the unique issues facing older adults (≥65 years old) including a large burden of pain, extensive analgesics use, and recent increase in drug overdose-related deaths in the elderly population. Prior guidelines have provided no direction regarding appropriate opioid use to treat pain in nursing home residents. This is problematic due to the high prevalence of chronic pain in nursing home residents as well as age-related vulnerability to adverse drug events due to changes in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and higher prevalence of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy in this population as compared to noninstitutionalized older adults.  Using an in-house national repository of Minimum Data Set 3.0 – a federally required clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes – merged to Medicare Part A and D and facility-level characteristics in CASPER (Certification and Survey Provider and Enhanced Reporting) from 2011-2013, this proposal addresses the evidence gap in safe opioid use in US nursing home residents with three specific aims: 1) to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and facility-level correlates of opioid use in terms of duration of use (acute vs. chronic), duration of action (short- vs. long-acting), and dose in “morphine equivalents”; 2) to estimate the incidence of opioid-related drug overdoses and identify resident- and drug regimen-related risk factors for opioid overdose; and 3) to evaluate the comparative safety of specific commonly-initiated opioids in terms of serious adverse health outcomes (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, fractures, and bowel obstruction). Methodological innovations include the use of multilevel modeling and targeted maximum likelihood estimation approaches. This proposal is directly relevant to the approximately 1.4 million older adults living in US nursing homes on any given day – many of whom will receive opioids while institutionalized. The knowledge generated will inform stakeholders on how opioids are used in this population, the risk of overdose when using opioids, and the comparative safety of short- and long- term use of commonly initiated opioids in the nursing home setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 1.4 million US adults live in nursing homes on any given day; many experience acute and chronic pain often treated with opioid analgesics despite the potential risks associated with these medications. This study will describe the resident and facility risk factors associated with receiving opioids, risk factors for opioid overdose, and the comparative safety of commonly-initiated opioids.

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9259974,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,464095,0.10571862941688939
"eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of seizures and unintentional overdose fatalities related to illicit synthetic opioids in multiple states across the U.S. Submitted in response to NIDA PAR-16-055, Research Area 1 (Responses to sudden and severe emerging drug issues), this time-sensitive R21 application builds on interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Additions Research (CITAR) and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The overall purposes of the proposed study are to (a) characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends, and (b) identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) from three ""cryptomarkets"" located in the Deep Web. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Develop a semi-automated knowledge-based system, eDarkTrends, to collect and process data about illicit synthetic opioids supplied on cryptomarkets; 2a) Describe and monitor US-based supply trends of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets (e.g., trends in availability of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl analogs, U-47700, MT-45), including types of illicit synthetic opioids, prices, advertised purity, dosage and product forms, quantity supplied, and drug combinations; 2b) Identify new illicit synthetic opioid substances and product forms soon after they appear on cryptomarkets. The proposed study is significant because it will provide new information about illicit synthetic opioids and will identify new illicit synthetic opioids as soon as they appear on those markets. The key innovation is the development of a semi-automated system able to a) collect and analyze advertisement data from cryptomarkets and b) identify new emerging substances advertised on these markets. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study will collect and analyze data extracted from Deep Web cryptomarkets to characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends in the U.S, and will identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid-related terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) as soon as they appear on these markets. It will be the first system to apply semi-automated computational techniques to monitor the supply of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets.

"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.            ",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9026192,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Analgesics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,578991,0.18102626124337107

"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The people at greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice-involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for these individuals are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. Our prior research shows that delivering individual level treatment engagement interventions increase the rate at which individuals receive bup. Thus, our solution is to improve engagement in bup treatment among justice-involved individuals by 1) “disrupting” system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot to make the referral, and 2) addressing low individual motivation by programming the chatbot to deliver the BNI itself, without the need for a trained professional. Aim 1: Design and develop a functional prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (including focus groups) with all stakeholders; and (b) creation of a functional chatbot using ML and NLP that is integrated with a mobile application, an application program interface server, and an administrator portal. Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to BNI Chatbot or Treatment-as-Usual (TAU). Hypothesis 1. The BNI Chatbot group will have a higher percentage of participants attending their first bup appointment than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Primary outcome). Hypothesis 2. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of readiness and intention to engage in bup treatment, and lower opioid use, as measured by urine toxicology tests, than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Secondary outcomes). Hypothesis 3. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of satisfaction than the TAU group. PROJECT NARRATIVE Justice-involved individuals with Opioid Use Disorder coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine, a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of overdose death by half.

"A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change. Project Summary/Abstract Behaivior is developing a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearables (like an advanced FitBit) and artificial intelligence. Knowing in real time when someone with opioid use disorder is at a high risk of relapsing revolutionizes the ability to intervene at the right moment to help people stay sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high risk opioid craving/obsession state and enabled the creation of a predictive model for just in time intervention. The number of deaths from opioid overdose is increasing every day, so reducing opioid addiction relapses will save lives and families and it will reduce rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations. Over 23 million Americans are addicted to drugs and alcohol, and these addictions cost the U.S. $442 billion per year, according to the US Surgeon General’s office. The majority of treatment tools used to keep those in recovery sober have low or mixed success rates. Many people in recovery end up relapsing multiple times, with the heroin relapse rate around 90%. With the technology that we are developing, Behaivior will detect if someone in recovery is in a red alert craving or “obsession” state and then, using artificial intelligence, we will provide support in real time by connecting someone to a support network member and/or provide a customized digital intervention. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human brain’s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks. Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains resources. This team uses machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial focus is opioids, this unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions, resulting in cost and health benefits across many populations. Project Narrative Behaivior is developing a system to predict and prevent opioid addiction relapses and overdoses using wearables and artificial intelligence for timely interventions. Our innovation lowers relapse and overdose rates and improves treatment adherence, which we anticipate will mitigate pain points such as higher treatment costs insurers currently pay from patient relapses, will reduce emergency room and first responder costs, and will ease (or alleviate) employers’ pain points such as poorer employee productivity and the added training and replacement costs. Through this program, Team Behavior will explore how to best tailor our technology for our likely first payers and validate the next potential customer segment we should pursue.","A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change.",10085849,R43DA046149,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Binge Eating', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Devices', 'Employee', 'Family', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heroin', 'Human', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Obsession', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'addiction', 'anger management', 'behavior change', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'first responder', 'fitbit', 'global health', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rearrest', 'reincarceration', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'success', 'sugar', 'support network', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'unsafe driving', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDA,"BEHAIVIOR, LLC",R43,2020,55000,0.13051873007815953
"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums— OpiatesRecovery and Opiates—to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation.",Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication,9979829,R21DA048739,"['Acupuncture Therapy', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Belief', 'Benchmarking', 'Categories', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Food', 'Food Additives', 'Food Supplements', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Harm Reduction', 'Herb', 'Herbal Medicine', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Link', 'Marijuana', 'Medical', 'Meditation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Prescription Drugs', 'Opioid', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Published Comment', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Medication', 'Supervision', 'Terminology', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Twitter', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Vitamins', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'Yoga', 'alternative treatment', 'cost', 'craving', 'dietary supplements', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'interest', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'off-label use', 'online community', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'patient population', 'self help', 'social media', 'spelling', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R21,2020,268226,0.07474298948278962
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics. This node will support clinical trials relevant to the epidemics and also advance research in novel models of care, data analytics, mobile interventions and training.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,9956715,UG1DA049467,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data Analytics', 'Distance Education', 'Drug abuse', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Epidemic', 'Federal Government', 'Gender Identity', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heroin', 'Home environment', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Los Angeles', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midwestern United States', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Professional Education', 'Professional Practice', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Sex Orientation', 'Side', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'collaborative care', 'cooking', 'digital', 'eHealth', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'metropolitan', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sexual identity', 'socioeconomics', 'substance misuse', 'suburb', 'success', 'telehealth', 'urban area', 'waiver', 'young adult']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2020,422584,-0.011954032813393502
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9951022,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,203040,0.1297244582146594
"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Addictions to cigarettes and opioids are public health epidemics. The goal of this study is to identify gene networks that predispose individuals to these addictions. We will leverage cutting-edge methods (such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence), large-scale genome-wide association data in living subjects, and multiple omics data in postmortem human brain to further our understanding of the neurobiology underlying addiction.",Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids.,10056112,R01DA051913,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cigarette', 'Complex', 'Cotinine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Epidemic', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'cigarette addiction', 'cigarette smoking', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'random forest', 'smoking addiction', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2020,597080,0.10294553670941288
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10039535,K99DA051534,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caucasian American', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'forest', 'health administration', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'skills', 'social', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment disparity']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,179582,0.10624881338457992
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10136941,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2020,746725,0.06708791508773494
"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10138614,R43DA050399,"['Abstinence', 'Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Guns', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methadone', 'Monitor', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Opioid replacement therapy', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contingency management', 'craving', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'illicit opioid', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'methadone treatment', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'supervised learning', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2020,276533,0.1884308037812578
"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10013066,R43DA051279,"['Accidents', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dropout', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency response', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Heroin', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Municipalities', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prescription drug overdose', 'Productivity', 'Professional counselor', 'Program Development', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visualization software', 'Weather', 'Workplace', 'Wrist', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'digital', 'early onset', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'motivational intervention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient engagement', 'personalized intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recidivism', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2020,251492,0.16042388661394588
"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,10212519,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2020,833315,0.20452989376019384
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9869872,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comparison intervention', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,547843,0.18102626124337107
"NCATS ASPIRE REDUCTION-TO-PRACTICE CHALLENGE NCATS has recently established the development of A Specialized Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (ASPIRE) to aid in the discovery and development of novel and effective treatments, while at the same time making the process faster and more cost-effective, with a particular focus on pain, OUD and overdose as part of the the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative, or NIH HEAL InitiativeSM.  The NCATS ASPIRE Program aims to develop and integrate automated synthetic chemistry, biological screening and artificial intelligence approaches in order to significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between chemical and biological space and enable further access into biologically-relevant chemical space. The ASPIRE platform will utilize currently available knowledge to develop innovative algorithms and predict and synthesize novel structures capable of interacting with specific targets; enable small-scale synthesis of the predicted molecules; and incorporate in-line, rapid biological testing of the molecules. Any new data obtained through this process would then be fed back into the system to further improve design, synthesis and biological characteristics of molecules.  Over 25 million people in the United States experience pain every day (2012 National Health Interview Survey data(link is external)) and need safe, addiction-free treatments to alleviate their suffering.  This clinical demand is of tremendous importance given that overprescribing of opioids for managing acute and chronic pain has fueled the current epidemic of opioid use disorder and overdose deaths, and the effectiveness of opioids for long-term pain management is being questioned.  Safe, effective, and non-addictive drugs (small molecules and biologics) to treat pain, mitigate addiction and reverse overdose are key to addressing the opioid crisis.  Given failures and limitations of previous drug development efforts, drugs that recognize novel targets, have novel structures, and can be identified in human-based, physiologically relevant in vitro systems are needed.  To further advance the NCATS ASPIRE Program and build on the innovations of the ASPIRE Design Challenges, and reward and spur innovative solutions to the development of new drugs for pain, addiction, and overdose, NCATS is issuing this Reduction-to-Practice Challenge to highly collaborative innovators interested in developing working prototypes of novel approaches that would lead to efficacious and non-addictive pain treatments and/or novel treatments for addiction and overdose.  The ultimate goal of the NCATS ASPIRE Program under the HEAL Initiative is the development of a platform that a wide spectrum of scientists can use to advance their translational science relevant to development and pre-clinical testing of new and safer treatments of pain, OUD, and overdose. Further, it is essential that the approach developed in this phase is applicable to any translational problem. n/a",NCATS ASPIRE REDUCTION-TO-PRACTICE CHALLENGE,10285773,213775,"['Acute pain management', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biological Testing', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'System', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost effective', 'design', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'small molecule']",NCATS, ,N01,2020,1375000,-0.04382489820865078
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9889092,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2020,188616,0.2353633041884658
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder The current opioid crisis is significantly impacting millions of lives, healthcare, social welfare, and the economy. Patient interactions with the treatment system coupled with results of completed studies create a wealth of data stored in disparate electronic sources. Therapists and health care providers with limited time and resources face challenges to access, integrate and monitor this vast data set for novel opportunities to improve care. Significant advances would include predicting when a patient will relapse out of a program, and also suggesting optimal personalized care strategies to reengage patients before this negative event occurs.  Survive-OUD will solve these challenges by providing a web-based therapist interface integrating survivor model artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Based on multiple input data domains leveraged from existing electronic medical record sources, survivor recurrent neural networks will be trained to recognize when patients are likely to relapse or drop out of an OUD program. Examples of data domains that can be input to the network include patient demographics, medical and prescription data, engagement with therapy paradigms, and compliance with logistical program tasks. Furthermore, once a patient is noted as high risk, a second layer of algorithms will be developed to recommend a specific and personalized care strategy for retention based on existing best practices in the literature and clinical trials. Therefore, the Survive-OUD platform will also integrate with common literature database and clinical trial repositories. Utilizing an existing AI platform for searching, tagging, and extracting data from database sources, the innovative platform will close the loop on actionable results by recommending updated care options based on potential outcomes learned from best practices in existing literature. The AI architecture developed will greatly improve success rates in opioid addition programs and expand high quality healthcare.  While the commercialized Survive-OUD platform will integrate all features above, Phase I will target feasibility of data aggregation and AI algorithms to detect relapse and recommend intervention strategies. The innovative technical challenge in Phase I is to develop and validate targeted AI tools using data already being captured in patient workflow to allow early prediction of patient retention issues. More specifically, a prototype therapist interface and data network infrastructure will be developed to source personalized patient data as well as literature and clinical trial sources. Once the platform architecture has passed verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection study to determine usability and also provide a rich set of de-identified data for algorithm development. Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection of patient dropout/relapse and appropriate treatment recommendation. The objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of Survive-OUD, an artificial intelligence driven platform to integrate complex data sources, predict patient relapse, and recommend intervention strategies for individuals impacted by opioid use disorder. Currently millions of Americans suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) and program relapse rates are extremely high. Therefore, an advanced, bioinformatics platform that accurately predicts when OUD patients will drop out of programs and offers personalized prevention strategies would provide a novel clinical tool to help combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.","Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder",10133357,R43DA052916,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Service delivery model', 'Social Welfare', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Update', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'retention rate', 'socioeconomics', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"INSILICA, LLC",R43,2020,251348,0.06270756707358253
"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9851853,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2020,161422,0.007184592419514742
"Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  To inform an effective response to the opioid epidemic, understanding the multilevel factors that influence risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical. In addition, although the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD is proven, long-term retention in treatment has been a challenge. Thus, efforts are needed to identify program implementation factors that can be strengthened to improve OUD treatment outcomes. The K01 Award will provide the candidate the requisite skills and mentored research experience necessary to meet her long-term goal of conducting independent, innovative research on OUD and its treatment that can guide strategic investment to prevent OUD and inform implementation of MAT programs to increase patient adherence. This proposal comprises a 5-year plan that includes mentorship by Wade Berrettini, MD, PhD, Brian Schwartz, MD, MS, H. Lester Kirchner, PhD, MS, Danielle Mowery, PhD, MS, and Alanna Kulchak Rahm, PhD, MS; didactic training activities to meet the candidate's training goals; and conduct of a two-phase research project that will provide the candidate with substantive experience leading epidemiologic research using electronic health record (EHR) data and in implementation science. The proposed research will be conducted at Geisinger, an integrated healthcare system serving a large geographically diverse region of Pennsylvania, leveraging its research assets—including a wealth of health-related EHR data and linked genetic data—and the ability to integrate research into the clinical environment. The aims of the research are twofold. Aim 1 centers on the social determinants that engender vulnerability to OUD, evaluating associations of community contextual factors related to socioeconomic, social, and physical conditions with OUD, and the role individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions play in these relations. Aim 1 will utilize EHR and genetic data from Geisinger patients (n = 18,728) coupled with secondary data characterizing community factors to conduct a nested case-control study. Aim 2 seeks to understand program implementation factors that impact patient adherence to MAT for OUD. Aim 2 is a mixed methods study that will involve interviews with key informants (n ≈ 30) to identify multilevel barriers and facilitators influencing MAT success, followed by a survey of adult patients (n = 500) in Geisinger's MAT clinics to quantify factors influencing MAT adherence from a patient perspective. Completion of this research will fulfill the candidate's short-term goals by providing training in: (1) OUD, its treatment, and substance use disorder research; (2) natural language processing; (3) measurement of contextual factors; (4) statistical analysis including multilevel modeling and mediation analysis; (5) gene-environment interaction research; and (6) implementation science. The proposed research will generate evidence to understand novel, understudied risk factors for OUD, with implications for investment in community-level prevention interventions, and how health systems can improve treatment retention among individuals with OUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research will elucidate how community contextual factors related to economic, social, and physical conditions work in conjunction with individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions in generating or mitigating risk for opioid use disorder. It will also identify program implementation factors at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels that influence adherence to medication-assisted treatment among patients with opioid use disorder. The research results will inform investment in preventive interventions where community conditions may increase risk for opioid use disorder as well as how health systems can increase retention in treatment programs for opioid use disorder.",Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy,10054517,K01DA049903,"['Abate', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adult', 'Buprenorphine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dropout', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Qualitative Research', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biobank', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'case control', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'contextual factors', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'health data', 'illicit opioid', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'rural counties', 'scale up', 'skills', 'social', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program']",NIDA,GEISINGER CLINIC,K01,2020,162032,0.08558286554553753
"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients. These tools will inform point-of-care service delivery, as well as enhance nationwide prevention and treatment interventions.",Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic,9989930,U01TR002628,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'California', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heroin', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investments', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Prescription Drugs', 'Odds Ratio', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome Study', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Site', 'Source', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'combat', 'comorbidity', 'data dictionary', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data tools', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fitness', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose prevention', 'point of care', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prototype', 'response', 'service delivery', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'synthetic opioid', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment research']",NCATS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2020,736713,0.09772353246185245
"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression,9884080,R01DA047637,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coughing', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Drug Implants', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Monitor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotics', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Respiration', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory Center', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strenuous Exercise', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Vital Statistics', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'optogenetics', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcutaneous stimulation', 'translational approach', 'translational impact', 'ventilation']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,701059,0.036997182943062375
"Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) PROJECT SUMMARY Analgesics are among the most commonly prescribed medications, and opioid painkillers are the gold standard for the management of severe acute pain, and for many chronic pain conditions. More than 30% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic pain, and nearly 40% of older adults report debilitating chronic pain conditions not caused by cancer. However, side effects of opioids, including tolerance, physical dependence, and respiratory depression have limited their effectiveness as pain killers. Rates of addiction and opioid overdose have escalated to a point of crisis. In the United States, on average approximately 115 people die every day from accidental overdose. Better, efficacious and safe opioid analgesic drugs with reduced risk of use are urgently needed. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) – an integrated knowledgebase aimed at accelerating and improving the success of translational research and drug discovery programs towards the identification of efficacious and save opioid drugs. ODO will enable multi-tiered analyses across diverse data types and hypothesis development for example by connecting chemical structure, biochemical binding profiles, pharmacological responses in animals and drug side effects and thus enable more effective rational drug discovery programs. To develop ODO we will leverage our extensive previous work in several research consortia developing formal ontologies, data standards, processing and integration methods, and software systems to enable integrated access, query and analysis of large scale and diverse data types. The current proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the ODO integrated knowledgebase and illustrate proof of concept via two Specific Aims: (1) to curate and harmonize ODO content from diverse data sources via a semantic knowledge model enabling integration of diverse data types, and (2) to deploy the ODO integrated Data Portal and Search Engine engaging the community and demonstrate its heuristic value. We envision that the ODO will pave the way to enable advanced machine learning and link results from molecular simulations with opioid analgesic drug pharmacology and functional selectivity, thus facilitating, at larger scale, the rational, predictive design, and scaffold optimization in drug development efforts towards identifying safer opioid analgesics.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,690910,0.08833776884747294
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder.

"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10026087,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,654124,0.1336004944366817
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9883766,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,464512,0.10571862941688939

"Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media 2/12/2019 ProjectSummary - Google Docs Project Summary I will leverage social media conversations, specifically Reddit, to examine treatment help-seeking at an unprecedented scale, thereby collecting evidence “in the wild” as a new strategy to monitor and respond to the opioid crisis through the following aims. Aim 1. Data Driven Characterization of Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users: I will systematically identify Reddit posts about opioids, identify if the post is help-seeking for treatment, and contextualize the content of help-seeking posts. Aim 2. Data Driven Characterization of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to understand how peers organically respond to help-seeking for treatment by building data-driven models to discern what attributes of posts are predictive of receiving a response from a peer and to examine the typical content and reciprocity of responses. Aim 3. Assess the Quality of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to identify the types of treatment, treatment services, and treatment referral services that are provided in the responses and assess the quality of lay responses to opioid treatment help-seeking. Currently, little is known about how drug users engage social media to support or combat their addictions. Reddit is the sixth most popular website in the US with many reporters noting that it may be the last lifeline for opioid users. Yet, little has been done to tap this potential source for social media monitoring, especially given the difficulty of finding self-identified opioid users who are already contemplating strategies to treat their addiction. This study adds a new significant perspective to social media monitoring and will be among the first in public health to consider social media conversation threads by assessing unique posts about opioid help-seeking, the responses these posts get, and the quality of responses to addiction help-seeking, thereby creating a knowledge base for public health leaders to respond. Success of these aims will generate a number of future research directions that will support interventions that address the needs of self-identified opioid users seeking help on Reddit. Moreover, within all three aims this study will bring significant methodological advances to the study of social media around substance use with the aims relying heavily on automated approaches and analysis first developed in the computational sciences engendering more data scientists to join public health to create actionable knowledge. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4XHd63xhPZT8OFf9bHQ2q6XHpYp_c4AbouAOtAC3SU/edit 1/1 2/12/2019 ProjectNarrative - Google Docs Project Narrative An explosion of surveillance tools fueled by big media data (including social media) is changing public health. These data reveal what a person is thinking/doing and when they are thinking/doing it based on the content and timing of their public posts, providing an assessment of organic help-seeking for addiction and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing that was never before possible. I will extract actionable intelligence from social media data, specifically Reddit, to support more agile, responsive opioid intervention research by studying (a) treatment help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, (b) lay responses to help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, and (c) whether lay peers link self-identified opioid users to evidence-based treatment, treatment services, or treatment referral services. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyIXTdDAbFSkCe81q6hThDiZzKGCXkCy8npWgzr5wfM/edit 1/1",Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media,9872029,K25DA049944,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Code', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Drug user', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Hotlines', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Social intelligence', 'Source', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'combat', 'dissemination trial', 'evidence base', 'help-seeking behavior', 'illicit opioid', 'knowledge base', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'peer', 'phrases', 'posters', 'prescription opioid', 'public health intervention', 'referral services', 'research study', 'response', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K25,2020,189498,0.1254117409209632
"AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform for women enrolled in drug treatment programs. The Opioid drug crisis in US increases at an alarming rate with 68% of the more than 70,200 drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid, averaging 130 Americans dying every day from opioid overdose (CDC, 2013). Remarkably, between 1999 and 2010, overdose deaths from prescription painkillers increased more than 400% among women, astonishing 1.7 times higher than that of men; and heroin use among women between 2002 and 2013 increased 100%, 2 times higher than among men (CDC, 2013). There is a call for gender-focused drug abuse interventions (OWH, 2016; NIH, 2018). Adverse social conditions, including economic insecurity, have been identified as risk factors for opioid use among women and reasons for relapse. Addressing addiction problems in conjunction with vocational rehabilitation and, specifically, entrepreneurial skills training has been suggested (SAMHSA, 2000). Furthermore, a good behavioral strategy should include community involvement, as it helps to maintain successful addictive behavioral change (NDCI, 2014). Unfortunately, only a handful of recovery centers offer entrepreneurial skills training and help women to engage in volunteer work or offer them employment opportunities, due to the lack of financial and human resources (SAHMSA, 2000). ​The objective of this Phase I grant application is to establish technical and commercial feasibility of Gooddler AI-powered, online social entrepreneurship training platform that aims to provide recovery centers with a cost-effective option that will address entrepreneurial skills training and match women with open job or volunteer opportunities at local non-profit organizations.​ To accomplish this objective, we plan to execute the following specific aims: 1) demonstrate commercial feasibility of Gooddler social entrepreneurship training curriculum with three recovery centers in San Francisco Bay Area; and 2) demonstrate the technical feasibility of Gooddler platform to match women in recovery with appropriate volunteering and/job opportunities at local non-profit organizations. We will establish the technical feasibility by developing community-opportunities matching model that will address the specifications of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The commercial feasibility will be demonstrated by helping women to gain skills and knowledge for meaningful engagement (job, volunteering, entrepreneurship). Success will move us closer to our long-term goal of providing drug recovery centers with a tool to help 430,000 women, entering US drug treatment programs every year, to get on the path of productive social involvement in communities of their choice. Gooddler, Inc. proposes to develop and validate an AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform, targeting 430,000 women in US enrolled in drug treatment programs annually, to give them the necessary knowledge and skills to ensure a productive social involvement in chosen communities after they complete the treatment. Our highly experienced team will be able to successfully execute the project in this $100M market and expand the offering to other settings. It can be easily adapted to be included in programs for incarcerated women, extended to be offered to men and/or to be offered as a stand-alone vocational skills training course.",AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform for women enrolled in drug treatment programs.,9985318,R43DA051061,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Budgets', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Drug Rehabilitation Centers', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Imprisonment', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Conditions', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vocational rehabilitation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'community involvement', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'men', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social engagement', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"GOODDLER, INC",R43,2020,225000,0.05470749932243607
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen these prevention efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of patient behaviors and clinical factors that increase overdose risk.",Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs,9895708,R01DA045816,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'American', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dizziness', 'Dose', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Fatigue', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'cost', 'drug testing', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'middle age', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'prescription opioid', 'repository', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2020,582062,0.1275335970174975
"Improving the Identification and Management of Suicide Risk among Patients Using Prescription Opioids ABSTRACT The opioid epidemic in the US, coupled with emerging data on the association between opioid use and suicidal behavior, highlights the urgent need for research that identifies patients at greatest risk and provides strategies to mitigate this risk. However, the development of risk algorithms that provide clinical guidance for providers with patients using opioids who may have underlying mental disorders or comorbid diagnoses has been nonexistent. Recent work has demonstrated the compelling need for a better understanding of, and clinical decision support tools to address, suicide risk among prescription opioid drug users. The proposed study provides an opportunity to address gaps in both the identification and clinical management of suicide risk in patients using prescription opioids. We propose to use transfer learning approaches to identify the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with elevated risk of suicidal behavior among prescription opioid users; to develop clinical phenotypes of patients with higher risk of suicidal behavior associated with prescription opioids, and to incorporate these phenotypes in a clinical decision support platform that can be used for identification and intervention at the point of care; and to conduct a pilot study implementing and evaluating the impact of the clinical decision support platform in the existing clinical workflow in 3 diverse clinical settings. Our approach is specifically designed to address the incomplete picture of patient risk in existing models due to the fragmentation of clinical care across settings. We do this by developing algorithms that can statistically “borrow” information from more comprehensive patient datasets and apply it to more limited datasets in a particular healthcare setting. The proposed work will draw on comprehensive clinical data from a mature health information exchange containing more than 2.3 million patients across the spectrum of clinical care to develop a statistically robust method to measure suicide risk associated with prescription opioid use. The clinical decision support tool developed under this proposal will provide a generalizable platform that could be extended to other opioid related risks, e.g., OUD and overdose. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients' behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients using prescription opioids who are at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide and prescription opioid use are two of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. The proposed project will demonstrate an innovative method for identifying patients using prescription opioids who are at risk of suicidal behavior.",Improving the Identification and Management of Suicide Risk among Patients Using Prescription Opioids,10155895,R01MH112148,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'chronic pain', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'data fusion', 'design', 'dosage', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'milligram', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'support tools', 'urgent care']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2020,853369,-0.10251615433025275
"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY The misuse of opioids, opioid addiction and overdose are a serious national public health crisis—the opioid epidemic—that despite increased scientific, clinical and government attention, continues to grow. Methadone is a generally effective treatment for opioid use disorder, however relapse rates remain high, and risk of overdose is greatest during relapse. There is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid relapse to improve our understanding of opioid use disorder and its treatment. Using connectome-based methods (i.e., functional connectivity) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recently identified a large-scale brain network that predicted opioid relapse from both resting and task states. Connectome-based methods enable data-driven characterization of whole brain networks related to behavior that might be better suited to describe complex clinical phenomena (e.g., opioid relapse). Building on prior work indicating the utility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to test brain activation patterns related to specific functions and individual abilities to regulate these functions, the proposed project will use connectome-based neurofeedback to target patterns of functional connectivity within our recently identified “opioid abstinence network”. This information is critical to improve understanding of mechanisms of opioid relapse. Individuals on methadone will be randomized to receive either active (n=12) or sham (n=12) connectome-based neurofeedback at 3 weekly scanning sessions including feedback and transfer runs. Additional baseline and follow-up scans will include resting state and reward and cognitive task runs. Craving, negative affect and opioid use will be measured weekly and at 1-mo follow-up. Based on our pilot data, connectome-based feedback will be targeted at the opioid abstinence network and we hypothesize that increased connectivity in this network will be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with reduced opioid use from baseline to follow-up scans (Aim 1a) and at 1-mo follow- up (Aim 1b). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with increased opioid abstinence network connectivity in resting state (Aim 2a) and task (reward, cognitive) state (Aim 2b) versus sham feedback, as in our pilot work. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with greater improvements in clinical features of opioid use disorder (craving, negative affect) than sham feedback (Aim 3a) and that increased opioid abstinence network connectivity will correlate with these improvements (Aim 3b). Overall, this project tests a potentially transformative hypothesis relating large-scale brain network dynamics to outcomes in opioid use disorder, and tests a highly innovative method for real-time fMRI neurofeedback from the opioid abstinence network to improve clinical features of opioid use disorder. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the functional neurobiology of opioid relapse and more generally has the potential to transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project leverages advances in real-time fMRI neurofeedback and machine learning to test whether methadone-treated individuals with opioid use disorder can increase functional connectivity within an empirically-derived “opioid abstinence network” that has previously been identified to predict opioid relapse. This project will provide critical data and information to improve our understanding of opioid relapse and may transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions more generally. Findings should contribute to the scientific and clinical response to the growing opioid epidemic and be used to inform treatment development.",Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder,10025590,R21DA049583,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Government', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'connectome', 'craving', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methadone treatment', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,209375,0.22951162342716114
"Non-Invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Patients with Opioid Use Disorders Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients and others are opposed to treating addictions with medications that have opioid agonist properties. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is more acceptable for many patients, and recent studies show it to be equivalent in efficacy. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs. Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been associated with a 4-fold increase in drug overdose deaths in the past decade, and current treatments including medications that block the opioid receptor require a withdrawal period during which time many patients relapse and tragically may overdose and die. This project will assess a new device, non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS), that does not require surgery or implantation, and that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve as it passes through the neck, dampening the sympathetic nervous system and modulating brain regions in a way that may help patients during the opioid withdrawal period and reduce relapse. Studying the effects of nVNS on opioid craving and brain and physiological responses in patients with OUDs has the potential to reduce relapse and save lives, as well as increase our knowledge of changes to the brain and physiology that underlie OUDs and successful response to treatment.",Non-Invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Patients with Opioid Use Disorders,9983431,UG3DA048502,"['Abstinence', 'Adverse reactions', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Family', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Imagery', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Naltrexone', 'Neck', 'Nerve', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Radiolabeled', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Validation', 'Vasomotor', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'craving', 'drug craving', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'neuroregulation', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'tomography', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UG3,2020,739505,0.17948383505417792
