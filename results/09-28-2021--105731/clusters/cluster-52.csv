"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9803774,R01AR076120,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Felis catus', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphogenesis', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'graphical user interface', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'open source', 'particle', 'preference', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,631809,0.14760351917646194
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",9882865,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,340827,0.18560938071557675
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9787575,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2019,291536,0.07045253247718328
"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9778826,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'neural network', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,307172,0.16246497337845234
"CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Collaborating Pis and Consultant  United States  Pl: Anitha Pasupathy, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA  Co-Pl: Wyeth Bair, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA Japan  Pl: lsamu Motoyoshi, Dept. of Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan  Consultant: Hidehiko Komatsu, Tamagawa University, Japan  Specific Aims  Our visual system endows us with a diverse set of abilities: to recognize and manipulate  objects, avoid obstacles and danger during navigation, evaluate the quality of food, read text,  interpret facial expressions, etc. This relies on the neuronal processing of information about  form and material texture along the ventral pathway of the primate visual system (Ungerleider &  Mishkin, 1982; Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Studies over the past several decades have  produced detailed models of how visual information is processed in V1, the earliest stage along . this pathway (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1968; Movshon et al., 1978a, b; Albrecht et al., 1980), but  beyond V1 our understanding of visual processing and representation is limited. This is  particularly true with regard to our understanding of how visual representations of form and  texture jointly contribute to object perception and recognition. The broad goal of this proposal is  two-fold-to develop an experimentally-driven image-computable model for how naturalistic  visual stimuli are processed in area V4, an important intermediate stage along the ventral visual  pathway (Aim 1) and to discover how such a representation contributes to perception (Aim 2).  Past studies have shown that V4 neurons are sensitive to both the form (Desimone and Schein,  1987; Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994; Gallant et al., 1993; Pasupathy and Connor, 2001; Nandy et  al., 2013) and the surface texture of visual stimuli (Arcizet et al., 2008; Goda et al., 2014;  Okazawa et al., 2015). But, because expertise is narrow and experimental time limited,  scientists tend to focus exclusively on the encoding of form or texture and not on their joint  coding. For example, in the laboratories of the USA portion of this collaboration, we have until  now focused on form processing by carrying out neurophysiological studies using 2D shapes  with uniform surface properties to investigate how object boundaries are encoded (Oleskiw et  al., 2014; Popovkina et al., 2016). We have modeled our data by comparing the representation  of V4 neurons to that of the units in AlexNet (Pospisil et al., 2015), a prominent convolutional  neural net (CNN) trained to recognize objects (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). At the same time, the  Japanese contingent of this collaboration has investigated the encoding of surface texture and  gloss in human perception without associated form encoding (Motoyoshi et al., 2007; Sharan et  al., 2008; Motoyoshi, 2010; Motoyoshi & Matoba, 2012). Here we propose to bring our  respective expertise in studying form and texture encoding to bear on the question of how  naturalistic stimuli with both form and surface cues are encoded in area V4 and how these  representations support human visual perception. Our specific aims are:  Aim1. To build a unified image-computable model for neuronal responses to shapes and  textures in area V4  V4 responses to 2D shapes with uniform luminance/chromatic characteristics can be explained  by a hierarchical-Max (HMax) model for object recognition that emphasizes boundary features  (Cadieu et al., 2007). Such responses can also be explained by units in artificial deep  convolutional networks, in which boundary features are not explicitly emphasized (all features  are learned from initially random weights). On the other hand, V4 responses to texture patches  can be well explained by a higher-order image-statistics-based model (Okazawa et al., 2015).  Using shape data from the Pasupathy lab and texture data from the Komatsu lab (Japanese  consultant), we will ask whether responses of V4 neurons to shapes and textures can be Page 21 n/a",CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian,9765318,R01EY029997,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Facial Expression', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Japan', 'Japanese Population', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'area V4', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experimental study', 'food quality', 'human model', 'human subject', 'information processing', 'luminance', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'response', 'statistics', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,230475,0.09367617413332854
"Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing Project Summary The goal of this project is to test a novel theoretical framework for understanding how the ventral pathway subserves object vision. In the standard framework, a series of neural operations on 2D image data through many intermediate cortical stages, including area V4, leads to high-level perceptual representations, including representation of object identity, at the final stages of the ventral pathway. However, our preliminary microelectrode data from a fixating monkey show that many neurons in V4 represent volumetric (volume- enclosing) 3D shape, not 2D image patterns. These neurons respond to many different 2D images that convey the same 3D shape with different shape-in-depth cues, including shading, reflection, and refraction. They even respond preferentially to random dot stereograms that convey 3D volumetric shape with no 2D cues whatsoever. Moreover, our preliminary results with 2-photon functional imaging in anesthetized monkey V4 show that 3D shape signals are grouped by their similarity, and also group with isomorphic (same outline) 2D shape signals (which could contribute evidence to corresponding 3D shape inferences). We propose to capitalize on these preliminary data by demonstrating the prevalence of 3D shape tuning in area V4, analyzing the 3D shape coding strategies used by these neurons, and measuring how 2D and 3D shape signals are arranged at a microscopic level across the surface of V4. We expect these results to provide strong evidence that extraction of 3D shape fragments is a primary goal of V4 processing. This early extraction of 3D shape information, just two synapses beyond primary visual cortex, would suggest a competing framework for understanding the ventral pathway, in which the initial goal is to represent 3D physical structure, independent of the various 2D image cues used to infer it. In this framework, object recognition would be based on preceding information about 3D physical structure, which would explain why human object recognition is so robust to image changes, in a way that the best computational vision systems are not. The scientific impact of this work would be to divert vision experiments toward understanding representation of real world 3D structure (rather than 2D planar stimuli) and to encourage computational vision scientists to incorporate early 3D shape processing into the deep convolutional network models that are the current state of the art. Narrative This study will help explain how the human brain achieves such remarkably robust perception of visual objects. The results will help guide future rehabilitative and prosthetic strategies for patients with visual impairments, by elucidating neural strategies that could be used to bring computer vision prosthetics up to human performance levels, and by discovering specific neural signals for object information that could be replicated by electrode array implants in higher-level visual cortex.",Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing,9773064,R01EY029420,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'base', 'experimental study', 'individual response', 'network models', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual object processing']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,548567,0.17428438403126018
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,9679722,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2018,303226,0.07045253247718328
"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9669833,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2018,317513,0.16246497337845234
"CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Collaborating Pis and Consultant  United States  Pl: Anitha Pasupathy, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA  Co-Pl: Wyeth Bair, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA Japan  Pl: lsamu Motoyoshi, Dept. of Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan  Consultant: Hidehiko Komatsu, Tamagawa University, Japan  Specific Aims  Our visual system endows us with a diverse set of abilities: to recognize and manipulate  objects, avoid obstacles and danger during navigation, evaluate the quality of food, read text,  interpret facial expressions, etc. This relies on the neuronal processing of information about  form and material texture along the ventral pathway of the primate visual system (Ungerleider &  Mishkin, 1982; Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Studies over the past several decades have  produced detailed models of how visual information is processed in V1, the earliest stage along . this pathway (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1968; Movshon et al., 1978a, b; Albrecht et al., 1980), but  beyond V1 our understanding of visual processing and representation is limited. This is  particularly true with regard to our understanding of how visual representations of form and  texture jointly contribute to object perception and recognition. The broad goal of this proposal is  two-fold-to develop an experimentally-driven image-computable model for how naturalistic  visual stimuli are processed in area V4, an important intermediate stage along the ventral visual  pathway (Aim 1) and to discover how such a representation contributes to perception (Aim 2).  Past studies have shown that V4 neurons are sensitive to both the form (Desimone and Schein,  1987; Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994; Gallant et al., 1993; Pasupathy and Connor, 2001; Nandy et  al., 2013) and the surface texture of visual stimuli (Arcizet et al., 2008; Goda et al., 2014;  Okazawa et al., 2015). But, because expertise is narrow and experimental time limited,  scientists tend to focus exclusively on the encoding of form or texture and not on their joint  coding. For example, in the laboratories of the USA portion of this collaboration, we have until  now focused on form processing by carrying out neurophysiological studies using 2D shapes  with uniform surface properties to investigate how object boundaries are encoded (Oleskiw et  al., 2014; Popovkina et al., 2016). We have modeled our data by comparing the representation  of V4 neurons to that of the units in AlexNet (Pospisil et al., 2015), a prominent convolutional  neural net (CNN) trained to recognize objects (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). At the same time, the  Japanese contingent of this collaboration has investigated the encoding of surface texture and  gloss in human perception without associated form encoding (Motoyoshi et al., 2007; Sharan et  al., 2008; Motoyoshi, 2010; Motoyoshi & Matoba, 2012). Here we propose to bring our  respective expertise in studying form and texture encoding to bear on the question of how  naturalistic stimuli with both form and surface cues are encoded in area V4 and how these  representations support human visual perception. Our specific aims are:  Aim1. To build a unified image-computable model for neuronal responses to shapes and  textures in area V4  V4 responses to 2D shapes with uniform luminance/chromatic characteristics can be explained  by a hierarchical-Max (HMax) model for object recognition that emphasizes boundary features  (Cadieu et al., 2007). Such responses can also be explained by units in artificial deep  convolutional networks, in which boundary features are not explicitly emphasized (all features  are learned from initially random weights). On the other hand, V4 responses to texture patches  can be well explained by a higher-order image-statistics-based model (Okazawa et al., 2015).  Using shape data from the Pasupathy lab and texture data from the Komatsu lab (Japanese  consultant), we will ask whether responses of V4 neurons to shapes and textures can be Page 21 n/a",CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian,9692119,R01EY029997,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Facial Expression', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Japan', 'Japanese Population', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'area V4', 'base', 'experimental study', 'food quality', 'human model', 'human subject', 'information processing', 'luminance', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,263433,0.09367617413332854
"Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing Project Summary The goal of this project is to test a novel theoretical framework for understanding how the ventral pathway subserves object vision. In the standard framework, a series of neural operations on 2D image data through many intermediate cortical stages, including area V4, leads to high-level perceptual representations, including representation of object identity, at the final stages of the ventral pathway. However, our preliminary microelectrode data from a fixating monkey show that many neurons in V4 represent volumetric (volume- enclosing) 3D shape, not 2D image patterns. These neurons respond to many different 2D images that convey the same 3D shape with different shape-in-depth cues, including shading, reflection, and refraction. They even respond preferentially to random dot stereograms that convey 3D volumetric shape with no 2D cues whatsoever. Moreover, our preliminary results with 2-photon functional imaging in anesthetized monkey V4 show that 3D shape signals are grouped by their similarity, and also group with isomorphic (same outline) 2D shape signals (which could contribute evidence to corresponding 3D shape inferences). We propose to capitalize on these preliminary data by demonstrating the prevalence of 3D shape tuning in area V4, analyzing the 3D shape coding strategies used by these neurons, and measuring how 2D and 3D shape signals are arranged at a microscopic level across the surface of V4. We expect these results to provide strong evidence that extraction of 3D shape fragments is a primary goal of V4 processing. This early extraction of 3D shape information, just two synapses beyond primary visual cortex, would suggest a competing framework for understanding the ventral pathway, in which the initial goal is to represent 3D physical structure, independent of the various 2D image cues used to infer it. In this framework, object recognition would be based on preceding information about 3D physical structure, which would explain why human object recognition is so robust to image changes, in a way that the best computational vision systems are not. The scientific impact of this work would be to divert vision experiments toward understanding representation of real world 3D structure (rather than 2D planar stimuli) and to encourage computational vision scientists to incorporate early 3D shape processing into the deep convolutional network models that are the current state of the art. Narrative This study will help explain how the human brain achieves such remarkably robust perception of visual objects. The results will help guide future rehabilitative and prosthetic strategies for patients with visual impairments, by elucidating neural strategies that could be used to bring computer vision prosthetics up to human performance levels, and by discovering specific neural signals for object information that could be replicated by electrode array implants in higher-level visual cortex.",Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing,9579566,R01EY029420,"['Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'base', 'experimental study', 'individual response', 'network models', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual object processing']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,548567,0.17428438403126018
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI).

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,0.07115578731564413
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI).

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators.

"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,9099872,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,194340,0.12556614193131216

"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.        ",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,8970310,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,227680,0.12556614193131216
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8795204,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,304719,0.07115578731564413
"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients. Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.",Neural Basis of Shape from Texture,8843856,R01EY013312,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amblyopia', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Contracts', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Frequencies', 'Geometry', 'Head Movements', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Rotation', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Strabismus', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analog', 'area MT', 'area V1', 'base', 'design', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'novel', 'object motion', 'object shape', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2015,354693,0.1920236519882008

"Image-guided planning system for skull correction in children with craniosynostos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures and occurs in approximately one in 2000 live births. It results in cranial malformation that can lead to elevated intra-cranial pressure, brain growth impairment, and developmental deficiency. The most common treatment option for craniosynostosis is surgery. Currently, surgical treatment planning of craniosynostosis is mostly qualitative, subjective and irreproducible guided mainly by the surgeon's experience. While virtual planning has been successfully introduced in niche areas of craniofacial surgery, such as corrective jaw surgery applications, clinical tools that provide accurate and reproducible evaluation of cranial morphology to guide cranial vault remodeling do not yet exist. To cover this gap in current clinical practice, we will develop personalized preoperative planning for infants with craniosynostosis that allows for decreased operative time and blood loss, thereby reducing perioperative morbidity, but also facilitates an optimized and more durable long-term outcome.  In this Phase I STTR project, our goal is to design, develop and validate a virtual surgery system for optimal treatment planning for cranial remodeling. The plan includes creating a normative multi-atlas database to capture a wide breadth of normal variations on cranial shape and patient ages, developing image processing and statistical shape analysis algorithms to identify desirable post-operative skull shapes, and analyzing biomechanical properties of cranial bones to evaluate osteotomy plans. The surgeon will be presented with a visual and quantitative map of the patient's cranial malformations, the desired post-treatment cranial shape, and a personalized plan of how cranial shape should be altered in the least invasive fashion to most accurately approach the normal head shape. The impact of our technology is reduced perioperative morbidity and lower treatment costs. The technology will also enable the precise, quantitative comparison of measurements before and after cranial vault reconstruction to determine the efficacy and durability of specific reconstructive techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of cranial sutures and occurs in approximately one in 2000 live births.

Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients.          Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape.

"Population analysis of shape representation in V4    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The perception of shape is essential for object identification and visually guided action. The neural represenation of shape is mediated by a hierarchical system of brain areas known collectively as the ventral stream. Damage to ventral stream areas may lead to visual agnosias that can severely compromise quality of life. It is therefore important to achieve an understanding of how shape representation is generated. We will examine the neural representation of shape in V4, a brain region that is situated at an intermediate level on the ventral stream hierarchy. Our stategy will be to construct quantitative models of the relationship between neurophysiological activity and visual input at both the single cell and population levels. Our approach to constructing these models will be distinguished by the use of advanced non-linear statistical techniques, complex visual stimuli that simulates natural viewing conditions, and the use of multi-electrode arrays to record populations of neurons simultaneously. Interpretation and analysis of these models will allow us adress two specific questions: 1) what are the independent stimulus dimensions to which V4 neurons are tuned?; 2) how is the distributed activity of V4 cell populations combined to represent shape?           n/a",Population analysis of shape representation in V4,7483599,F32EY016941,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrodes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'area V4', 'base', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'neurophysiology', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'visual search', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2008,50428,0.14508086458114558
"Shape representation and attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the way the visual system processes complex shape. We focus on two intermediate visual areas, V2 and V4, located in the ventral processing stream immediately beyond primary visual cortex (area VI). These areas serve as the major input stages for higher-order shape processing areas in the temporal cortex. We propose neurophysiological experiments to investigate the way that shape is represented in these areas and the way that attention modulates these representations. Shape is difficult to describe and parameterize, so previous neurophysiological studies of shape processing have utilized simple, regular shapes that are experimentally convenient. However, intermediate shape processing is highly nonlinear, so results obtained with reduced stimulus sets may not generalize to other stimuli. We therefore propose to use both complex, natural stimuli and simpler stimuli such as gratings. To facilitate this, we are developing novel nonlinear regression algorithms to estimate the stimulus-response mapping functions of neurons in V2 and V4. The underlying shape dimensions represented therein can then be determined by applying visualization algorithms (developed in our laboratory) to the stimulus-response mapping functions estimated for single neurons. In another series of experiments we plan to investigate how extrastriate visual areas integrate information from earlier sensory areas. Finally, we propose to examine how visual attention affects shape representations in V2 and V4. We will accomplish this by quantifying the effects of selective attention to a specific shape (feature attention) and attention directed toward a specific location in space (spatial attention) on neuronal tuning curves. Successful completion of these projects will provide critical information to aid in development of quantitative computational models of shape processing in intermediate vision. n/a",Shape representation and attention,7386606,R01EY012241,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease regression', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'V4 neuron', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Width', 'area V2', 'area striata', 'directed attention', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'improved', 'movie', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,355274,0.16511800038758653

"Integrated Assessment of Corneal Form and Function  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cornea is a principal refractive element in the eye; corneal transparency and corneal shape determine its optical qualities. Corneal epithelial edema, stromal edema and corneal shape anomalies can independently or collectively degrade visual performance in the form of increased internal light scatter and optical aberrations due to irregular astigmatism. The central theme of this research proposal is the refinement and application of a mathematical model that integrates the thermodynamic description of corneal epithelial, stromal and endothelial transport properties into a model of corneal hydration control. This is combined with methods to classify shape anomalies and means to assess the optical quality of the corneal surface through the analysis of corneal topography.   This investigation will involve both an in vitro model and mathematical models, as well as direct applications to human clinical data, in the following specific aims: 1) Use adaptations of the Klyce and Russell model for corneal hydration dynamics to understand the corneal response to epithelial trauma that evokes the early inflammatory response signaled by transient edema. 2) Refine artificial intelligence methods for the classification and interpretation of corneal topography and ocular wavefront data with emphasis on a device-independent approach. 3) Determine and evaluate numerical constructs to evaluate corneal surface optical quality and ocular wavefront data as they relate to visual acuity in patients.   The long-term goal of this project is to integrate corneal metabolic and structural features into a comprehensive model. With this model and the proposed development of new methods for improved and more accurate assessment of the optical performance of the human eye, further progress toward the objective evaluation of the safety and efficacy of current and developing refractive surgical procedures and contact lenses can be obtained.   n/a",Integrated Assessment of Corneal Form and Function,7286911,R01EY003311,"['artificial intelligence', 'atrial natriuretic peptide', 'biological transport', 'body water dehydration', 'clinical research', 'cornea edema', 'corneal endothelium', 'corneal epithelium', 'corneal stroma', 'electrophysiology', 'human subject', 'intraocular fluid', 'laboratory rabbit', 'mathematical model', 'membrane permeability', 'model design /development', 'morphology', 'nitric oxide', 'refractive keratoplasty', 'thermodynamics', 'vision tests', 'visual perception']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2006,76298,0.1378132387738347

"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age.

"LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Morphometric tools developed        under this grant combine techniques from geometry, computer vision, statistics,      and biomathematics in powerful new strategies for analysis of data about size        and shape. This fourth funding period is directed to three extensions of the         established core methodology, along with continued dissemination. Aim 1.             Thin-plate spline interpolant aids the scientist's eye in detecting                  localization of interesting shape differences. Over the present funding period       the applicants reported having developed an algebraic/statistical formalization      of this tactic, the method of creases. Aim 1 of the renewal is to standardize        the parameterization of this feature, to provide protocols for significance          tests, and to produce ""a grammar of grids"" for uniting multiple creases into         coherent summaries of empirical deformations. Aim 2. The standard Procrustes         methods for discrete point landmarks have been extended for data sets of             outlines. Aim 2 of the renewal is to further extend these tools for realistic        data sets that combine discrete point landmarks and curves or surfaces               arbitrarily. The applicants proposed to formalize statistical spaces for such        structures and extend them to anticipate the emerging resource of neural tract       directional data (directions without curves). Aim 3. The best current                strategies for formal statistical inferences about shape exploit permutation         tests of Procrustes distance or its modifications.

COMPUTER AIDED CARDIAC MEASUREMENT The objective of the proposed research is to develop a method for providing fast and accurate measurements of volume and ejection fraction from 3D echo images. Our Computer Aided Measurement System will reconstruct the LV endocardium using a few user selected points on oriented echocardiographic images together with prior shape and size knowledge. The Specific Aims for Phase I are: 1. To improve the accuracy of quantitative echo while minimizing manual labor. 2. To improve the ease of use of the prototype system for application in a clinical setting. 3. To expand the catalog representing our knowledge base by acquiring additional large volume and abnormally shaped LV's in order to enhance fitting accuracy for atypical shapes. Previously described methods of analyzing echocardiograms in 3D require so much manual labor that this modality has been limited to research applications. The advantages of our proposed approach are that it makes the superior accuracy and reproducibility of 3D echo available for clinical practice. Furthermore this process will be applicable to other imaging modalities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This research will lead to products which can be sold to echocardiography system manufacturers and end users. The products will provide accurate and convenient value measurements.  n/a,COMPUTER AIDED CARDIAC MEASUREMENT,6211201,R43HL065827,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' echocardiography', ' heart dimension /size', ' heart disorder diagnosis', ' human data', ' image processing', ' measurement']",NHLBI,"QUANTIGRAPHICS, INC.",R43,2000,100000,0.04842954136263586

"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9969467,R01AR076120,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Felis catus', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphogenesis', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'graphical user interface', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'open source', 'particle', 'preference', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,614363,0.14760351917646194
"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis. This project will develop a novel integrated systems biology approach to elucidate mechanistically the molecular pathways and their coordination that control large-scale tissue growth dynamics in living organisms.

"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10023935,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,256578,0.18560938071557675
"ShapeWorks in the Cloud Project Summary This application is submitted in response to NOT-OD-20-073 as an administrative supplement to the parent award R01AR076120 titled: ""Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches."" The form (or shape) of anatomies is the clinical language that describes abnormal mor- phologies tied to pathologic functions. Quantifying such subtle morphological shape changes requires parsing the anatomy into a quantitative description that is consistent across the population in question. For more than 100 years, morphometrics has been an indispensable quantitative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms. But its representation capacity is limited to linear distances, angles, and areas. Sta- tistical shape modeling (SSM) is the computational extension of classical morphometric techniques to analyze more detailed representations of complex anatomy and their variability within populations The parent award ad- dresses existing roadblocks for the widespread adoption of SSM computational tools in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of open-source software tools, ShapeWorks. ShapeWorks enables learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image segmentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread applicability and impact to medicine and biology are hindered by computational barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The goal of this supplement award is to provide supplemental support for Aim 3 of the parent award to leverage best practices in software development and advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large-scale cohorts to build and execute custom SSM workﬂows us- ing remote scalable computational resources. To achieve this goal, we have developed a plan to enhance the design, implementation, and cloud-readiness of ShapeWorks and augmented our scientiﬁc team to add senior, experienced software engineers/developers who have extensive experience in professional programming, code refactoring, and scientiﬁc computing. This award will provide our team with the support necessary to (Aim 1) de- sign ShapeWorks as a collection of modular and reusable services, (Aim 2) decouple ShapeWorks services from explicitly encoded data sources, and (Aim 3) refactor ShapeWorks to scale efﬁciently on the cloud. All software development will be performed in adherence to software engineering practices and design principles, including coding style, documentation, and version control. The proposed efforts will be released as open-source software in a manner consistent with the principles of reproducible research and the practices of open science.

"Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY  The morphologic and mechanical characteristics of a tissue are fundamental to understanding the development, homeostasis, and pathology of the human body. During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks). PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed technology will provide the methodologies necessary to increase the clinical acceptance and applicability of computer models. These models measure three-dimensional tissue shape and estimate tissue mechanics, providing information that cannot be measured conventionally. We will implement these methods into software that can be used by the public free-of-charge.",Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics,9972694,R01EB016701,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Bone Density', 'Cardiology', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Grooming', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Pathology', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurology', 'Ontology', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'disease diagnosis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,563658,0.04701435672347435
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy.

"CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Collaborating Pis and Consultant  United States  Pl: Anitha Pasupathy, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA  Co-Pl: Wyeth Bair, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA Japan  Pl: lsamu Motoyoshi, Dept. of Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan  Consultant: Hidehiko Komatsu, Tamagawa University, Japan  Specific Aims  Our visual system endows us with a diverse set of abilities: to recognize and manipulate  objects, avoid obstacles and danger during navigation, evaluate the quality of food, read text,  interpret facial expressions, etc. This relies on the neuronal processing of information about  form and material texture along the ventral pathway of the primate visual system (Ungerleider &  Mishkin, 1982; Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Studies over the past several decades have  produced detailed models of how visual information is processed in V1, the earliest stage along . this pathway (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1968; Movshon et al., 1978a, b; Albrecht et al., 1980), but  beyond V1 our understanding of visual processing and representation is limited. This is  particularly true with regard to our understanding of how visual representations of form and  texture jointly contribute to object perception and recognition. The broad goal of this proposal is  two-fold-to develop an experimentally-driven image-computable model for how naturalistic  visual stimuli are processed in area V4, an important intermediate stage along the ventral visual  pathway (Aim 1) and to discover how such a representation contributes to perception (Aim 2).  Past studies have shown that V4 neurons are sensitive to both the form (Desimone and Schein,  1987; Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994; Gallant et al., 1993; Pasupathy and Connor, 2001; Nandy et  al., 2013) and the surface texture of visual stimuli (Arcizet et al., 2008; Goda et al., 2014;  Okazawa et al., 2015). But, because expertise is narrow and experimental time limited,  scientists tend to focus exclusively on the encoding of form or texture and not on their joint  coding. For example, in the laboratories of the USA portion of this collaboration, we have until  now focused on form processing by carrying out neurophysiological studies using 2D shapes  with uniform surface properties to investigate how object boundaries are encoded (Oleskiw et  al., 2014; Popovkina et al., 2016). We have modeled our data by comparing the representation  of V4 neurons to that of the units in AlexNet (Pospisil et al., 2015), a prominent convolutional  neural net (CNN) trained to recognize objects (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). At the same time, the  Japanese contingent of this collaboration has investigated the encoding of surface texture and  gloss in human perception without associated form encoding (Motoyoshi et al., 2007; Sharan et  al., 2008; Motoyoshi, 2010; Motoyoshi & Matoba, 2012). Here we propose to bring our  respective expertise in studying form and texture encoding to bear on the question of how  naturalistic stimuli with both form and surface cues are encoded in area V4 and how these  representations support human visual perception. Our specific aims are:  Aim1. To build a unified image-computable model for neuronal responses to shapes and  textures in area V4  V4 responses to 2D shapes with uniform luminance/chromatic characteristics can be explained  by a hierarchical-Max (HMax) model for object recognition that emphasizes boundary features  (Cadieu et al., 2007). Such responses can also be explained by units in artificial deep  convolutional networks, in which boundary features are not explicitly emphasized (all features  are learned from initially random weights). On the other hand, V4 responses to texture patches  can be well explained by a higher-order image-statistics-based model (Okazawa et al., 2015).  Using shape data from the Pasupathy lab and texture data from the Komatsu lab (Japanese  consultant), we will ask whether responses of V4 neurons to shapes and textures can be Page 21 n/a",CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian,9994299,R01EY029997,"['3-Dimensional', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Facial Expression', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Japan', 'Japanese Population', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'area V4', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experimental study', 'food quality', 'human model', 'human subject', 'information processing', 'luminance', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'response', 'statistics', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,230475,0.09367617413332854
"Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing Project Summary The goal of this project is to test a novel theoretical framework for understanding how the ventral pathway subserves object vision. In the standard framework, a series of neural operations on 2D image data through many intermediate cortical stages, including area V4, leads to high-level perceptual representations, including representation of object identity, at the final stages of the ventral pathway. However, our preliminary microelectrode data from a fixating monkey show that many neurons in V4 represent volumetric (volume- enclosing) 3D shape, not 2D image patterns. These neurons respond to many different 2D images that convey the same 3D shape with different shape-in-depth cues, including shading, reflection, and refraction. They even respond preferentially to random dot stereograms that convey 3D volumetric shape with no 2D cues whatsoever. Moreover, our preliminary results with 2-photon functional imaging in anesthetized monkey V4 show that 3D shape signals are grouped by their similarity, and also group with isomorphic (same outline) 2D shape signals (which could contribute evidence to corresponding 3D shape inferences). We propose to capitalize on these preliminary data by demonstrating the prevalence of 3D shape tuning in area V4, analyzing the 3D shape coding strategies used by these neurons, and measuring how 2D and 3D shape signals are arranged at a microscopic level across the surface of V4. We expect these results to provide strong evidence that extraction of 3D shape fragments is a primary goal of V4 processing. This early extraction of 3D shape information, just two synapses beyond primary visual cortex, would suggest a competing framework for understanding the ventral pathway, in which the initial goal is to represent 3D physical structure, independent of the various 2D image cues used to infer it. In this framework, object recognition would be based on preceding information about 3D physical structure, which would explain why human object recognition is so robust to image changes, in a way that the best computational vision systems are not. The scientific impact of this work would be to divert vision experiments toward understanding representation of real world 3D structure (rather than 2D planar stimuli) and to encourage computational vision scientists to incorporate early 3D shape processing into the deep convolutional network models that are the current state of the art. Narrative This study will help explain how the human brain achieves such remarkably robust perception of visual objects. The results will help guide future rehabilitative and prosthetic strategies for patients with visual impairments, by elucidating neural strategies that could be used to bring computer vision prosthetics up to human performance levels, and by discovering specific neural signals for object information that could be replicated by electrode array implants in higher-level visual cortex.",Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing,9942414,R01EY029420,"['3-Dimensional', '3D world', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experimental study', 'individual response', 'network models', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual object processing']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,548567,0.17428438403126018
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment.
