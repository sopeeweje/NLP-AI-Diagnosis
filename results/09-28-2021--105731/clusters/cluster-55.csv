"ADNI Psychometrics: Machine Learning to discern Natural History Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the longitudinal structural data we are already analyzing. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for the longitudinal structural imaging data of Aim 2. Longitudinal imaging data are particularly significant, as any differences we find in the evolution of brain structure over time across subgroups supports the notion that the subgroups have distinct natural histories, which in turn goes a long way towards the provocative conclusion that these subgroups of “Alzheimer's disease” represent distinct conditions. Machine learning approaches to these data were not envisioned in the initial proposal, but represent a particularly valuable complementary approach that may identify similarities and differences in trajectories of the evolution of brain structure that would not be apparent using the more traditional analytic pipelines we outlined in the proposal. This then is the perfect fit for an Administrative Supplement – this is an opportunity to enhance the value of the parent study by adding new expertise to investigate in a complementary and valuable fashion a question that was already addressed by the parent grant. This Supplement builds on the same infrastructure and questions asked in Aim 2, but augments our analytical armamentarium with novel machine learning approaches. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672,  'ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups. This proposal would add machine learning approaches for the longitudinal structural imaging data to the analytic strategies already being pursued by the investigators. This Supplement Proposal would substantially augment the scientific value of the overall study.",ADNI Psychometrics: Machine Learning to discern Natural History Aim 2 Supplement,9933184,R01AG029672,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Parents', 'Psychometrics', 'Published Comment', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'executive function', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'supervised learning']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,281279,-0.019512430767622276
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9695211,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,522460,0.05496579744680791
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9698938,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,446909,0.012909549749411156
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9687747,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2019,163943,-0.002396221720614416
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9818198,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,399485,0.030242877790419186
"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures. In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 35,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner.

"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9769180,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,559137,-0.0284012932265298
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9675333,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,363758,0.02294148011852247
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will advance our understanding of the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders.","Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance",9655386,R01NS106094,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resistance', 'Science', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical development', 'computational basis', 'denoising', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'movement practice', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,343378,0.004895652177910022
"Brain Science Compute Cluster Computational requirements of contemporary brain science research typically exceed financial and resource management limits of individual investigator laboratories. Many brain science research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high speed storage devices. An ongoing limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a contemporary and readily accessible high-speed computational resource.  We plan to replace an existing, but 5 year old and now outmoded, central computational resource that has outdated graphic processing units (GPU) and central processing units (CPU) and and limited storage that will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access to stand-alone workstations. The requested computation equipment comprises 13 GPU nodes (total of 52 cores), 12 CPU nodes (288 cores) and 1.2 petabytes of disk storage, which will serve the needs of the assembled brain science researchers. The equipment will become integrated into Brown's high performance Compute Cluster, which has system software that automatically balances GPU and CPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off- loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets.  This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists. The system can be readily expansion as needs, either computational, storage, or new users, arise. Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost.  The flexible nature of the system will serve a variety of research needs of the Brown brain science community. The computational resource is expected to bring together researchers at Brown working on the common problem of neural processing. Relevance Gaining insights into the neural and brain mechanisms that underlie normal brain function and malfunction in disease requires analysis of large and complex data sets related to behavior and brain physiology, chemistry and structure.

"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC.

"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9712424,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphatic vessel', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,540520,0.00850944159216387
"Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease Abstract/Summary  Our parent grant U01-MH108898 entitled “Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease” has a focus on understanding the mechanisms of dysplasia of the cerebral cortex, and the contribution of brain somatic mosaicism to this process. Mosaicism is the occurrence of two (or more) genomes in an individual who is derived from a single zygote. Members of the NIMH-supported Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network (BSMN) are characterizing mosaic variation in other neuropsychiatric disorders with a common goal of assessing the role of somatic mosaic variation across diseases including BPD, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, and dysplasias. We propose three capstone projects to map the full spectrum of somatic variation in human brain and characterize the contributions of mosaic variants to neuropsychiatric disease risk. These capstones can advance the mission of the BSMN, to both achieve greater power of discovery of somatic mutations by combining and harmonizing deep coverage whole genome sequencing data that have been generated across nodes, as well as placing the variants identified through the study of brain somatic mosaicism (BSM) in the context of neurodevelopment and disease. To integrate this multi- dimensional data from the BSMN, as well as other consortia, administrative supplements are requested to continue, in the final two years of the award, three capstone projects, as well as to contribute to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and data analytic core (DAC). We expect these Capstone Projects to increase the profile of the BSMN by creating an unprecedented data resource of somatic mosaicism variants across development and diseases widely available to the scientific community. The enhanced power provided by the combined analyses of the BSMN will provide foundational knowledge that will guide future work, and lead to new insight into brain somatic mosaicism. The specific aims are (1) for Capstone 2, to assess the somatic mutational landscape in the human brain, by an unprecedented, comprehensive mapping of brain mosaicism in a single person; (2) for Capstone 3, to exploit deeply sequenced bulk short-read WGS to detect somatic structural variation by refining and employing a novel machine-learning classifier approach named CHONK that was developed in our lab. Project Narrative This project assesses the natural mosaic variation in the human brain using unprecedented depth on comprehensive sampling to analyze the mosaicism within a single individual. We will further extend our analysis of mosaic variation to structural variants by employing a novel, machine-learning based, classifier. 1",Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease,9905189,U01MH108898,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Communities', 'Cortical Dysplasia', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Dysplasia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Microglia', 'Mission', 'Mosaicism', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'data resource', 'disorder risk', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'whole genome', 'zygote']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2019,248888,0.007907253033342092
"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter. The BCI intervention would complement traditional speech therapy using behavioral methods. The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few. Project narrative The goal of this project is to develop brain-computer interface technology to optimize brain function on an individual basis. This could have therapeutic applications to many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.",Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering,9659309,R21DC016353,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurologic', 'Normal Range', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stroke', 'Stuttering', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'improved', 'indexing', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2019,170514,-0.04030868271490898
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,0.039638544667856664
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9830832,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image Analysis', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2019,418757,-0.06405054338542954
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,9802309,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'retinal rods']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2019,293568,0.005879741059702151
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9694688,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'base', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,450954,0.02991528200336587
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9717282,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2019,670982,0.018294828741985875
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9795341,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2019,926107,0.06502721463401183
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,9800892,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,716265,-0.00014255480770182042
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions.

Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9750274,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,543993,0.04420062861426629
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,9882822,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2019,390806,0.007413920890872806
"Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation SUMMARY Recent technological developments such as tissue clearing and light sheet imaging have allowed for the three- dimensional visualization of the entire brain at cellular resolution. Translucence Biosystems has advanced this technology further by developing a) a proprietary Mesoscale Imaging System that allows visualization of an entire mouse brain much faster than prior techniques, b) machine learning-based algorithms that identify individual cells across the entire intact mouse brain and c) routines that rapidly determine cell densities in >1,200 brain regions defined by the annotated Allen Brain Atlas.  In the present proposal we will show the power of our technique by visualizing microglia density across the entire mouse brain as a biological marker for neuroinflammation. Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain. While they play important roles in healthy brain function, they also mediate neuroinflammatory processes that have a significant impact in multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis as well as play possible roles in several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, chemo brain). A tool for three-dimensional imaging of neuroinflammation patterns across the whole brain will help advance our understanding of neuroinflammatory processes in neurological diseases and aid in the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.  To visualize microglia, we will evaluate multiple strategies, including the CX3CR1-GFP mouse line, which expresses GFP in microglia, Iba1 immunolabeling and other antibody markers of activated microglia. The utility of our approach for monitoring neuroinflammation will be demonstrated in CX3CR1-GFP mice by treating them with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice will be injected with three different LPS doses, and then microglia will be visualized and automatically counted across >1,200 brain regions. We will confirm the neuroinflammatory response to LPS by measuring protein markers of inflammation.  The applicability of our technique to neurodegenerative disease will be demonstrated by studying a mouse line used as a model of Alzheimer's disease that presents pronounced patterns of neuroinflammation. These experiments are designed to prove that our approach can provide reliable and detailed information describing neuroinflammation and that our results are better in terms of speed, resolution, and richness of information than any other technique available.  Once the goals for Phase I are met, we will be positioned to develop our microglia activation assay into a new gold standard for precise and complete histological detection of neuroinflammation. During phase II, we plan to 1) develop machine learning tools to establish morphological criteria that differentiate resting from activated microglia, 2) characterize microglial signatures in various mouse models of diseases with known or suspected neuroinflammation components, and 3) validate the microglial targeting of anti-inflammatory therapeutic candidates. NARRATIVE Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, protect against injury and infection. Microglia also play a critical role in dysfunctional neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to the development of brain diseases. We have developed novel methods to make mouse brains transparent so we can visualize and precisely count microglia throughout the intact mouse brain. In this proposal, we will test the feasibility of measuring brain-wide microglia activation using two disease models with a strong neuroinflammatory component, including a common transgenic mouse model that recapitulates the amyloid plaque accumulation that is a central feature of Alzheimer’s Disease.",Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation,9908302,R43MH122070,"['AIDS dementia', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Encephalitis', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Light', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Senile Plaques', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'abeta deposition', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'chemobrain', 'cytokine', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NIMH,"TRANSLUCENCE BIOSYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2019,449956,0.04614480335736608
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,9755508,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,465334,-0.008316766174192969
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2019,857083,0.03952031263535452
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,0.01859262900551805
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9783829,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2019,202477,0.036288906204500856
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG source dynamics and results of existing research using fMRI and other brain imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics,9737997,R01NS047293,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Mail', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Links List', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Paper', 'Plug-in', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'brain research', 'central database', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'mathematical methods', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'online course', 'open source', 'research study', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'teaching laboratory', 'tool', 'wiki']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,593300,0.05113463558685843
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",9789280,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,21171,0.020714203042376575
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,9871505,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2019,108276,0.05276986547550739
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI.

We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others. Project Narrative  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allow the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded with high spatial and temporal resolution.

"India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health ABSTRACT Our revised proposal launches the India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health - a globally coordinated study of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), created response to the NIH FOA: Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan (R01; PAR-18-834; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-835.html). Our overall goal is to identify predictive markers in the blood, genome, and epigenome that influence brain aging in India, to better understand prognosis, and to support personalized risk evaluations on each continent. We plan to identify etiological pathways to resilience using the rich biobanking strategy developed by our partners at NIMHANS in India. To do this, we will leverage our global consortium, ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu), to partner with dementia research pioneers in India, creating new links between international biobanks, and building research capacity. By 2020, 70% of the world's population over age 60 will live in developing countries, with 14% in India (Mathuranath 2012). Recently, attention has been drawn to a “diversity” crisis in brain research, as most brain research is conducted in Caucasian populations from relatively wealthy backgrounds (LeWinn 2017). This lack of ethnic diversity means that: (1) we do not know if predictors of health (and disease) generalize to other ethnic groups, and (2) we fail to collect vital data that could teach us how AD progresses in populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Our coordinated analyses in US/EU and Indian biobanks will help identify brain aging predictors specific to India and those that are universal. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Create Lifespan Charts of brain aging Trajectories in India using MRI, DWI and Resting State Functional MRI. Aim 2. Identify Blood and Epigenetic Markers that Predict Brain Aging and AD in India. Aim 3. Using a combination of multimodal imaging, blood markers, and clinical data to predict clinical decline in India. We test structural equation models that hypothesize how brain aging depends on lifestyle and psychosocial factors (diet, family support, drug abuse, literacy, sleep, and depression), as well as sex, education, and AD genetic risk. With novel machine learning methods, will analyze blood markers and plasma proteomic analytes, to define processes that are harmful to brain aging. In Capacity Building Aims, we will leverage ENIGMA's successful strategies to train emerging and established scientists in India to analyze their data with high quality control and precision, with targeted biostatistical and imaging workshops to bolster capacity. This collaborative India-US initiative will enable future science initiatives, and equip the NIMHANS team with the necessary tools to train new scientists and independently conduct high impact research bridging efforts into numerous international partnerships.

"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9776502,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,400000,0.03283266568783613
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning. PROJECT SUMMARY Synaptic dysfunction is a common feature of neuropsychiatric disease. For example, a hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is synaptic fibrilization and aggregation of key proteins that participate in synapse and cell loss. Maladaptive plastic changes in synapse structure and function underlie key aspects of behavioral and mood disorders ranging from addiction to depression, as well as neurodevelopmental diseases like schizophrenia and autism. It is for these reasons that many investigators across a range of neuroscience disciplines study the synapse, and the reason that new tools to study synapse structure and function within neural circuits of interest are sorely needed. Indeed, current tools to assess synapse structure in defined cell types are not readily compatible with state-of-the-art 3D volume approaches such as serial block face scanning electron microscopy, and are severely hampered by inadequate computational tools for quantitative assessment of these massive datasets. However, advances in molecular genetics, optics, engineering and computing provide new opportunities to develop information rich strategies to peer into the synapse. Here, we combine such advances to achieve a new state-of-the-art in imaging and analyzing microcircuit connectivity and synapse structure within neurotransmitter-defined neural networks. Specifically, we leverage the fact that the bulk of signaling across the synapse is mediated by a relatively small population of small molecule neurotransmitters that are synthesized and packaged into synaptic vesicles at the site of release in axonal compartments. The bulk of neurotransmission is thus dependent on just seven well- described vesicular transporters expressed in brain. Our overall goal is to build a rigorous, easily deployable, cell-type-specific, expandable, multi-functional toolkit for imaging and quantifying neurotransmitter-defined synaptic connections by both light and electron microscopy in mice. To accomplish this, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to insert electron microscopy-compatible tags into native vesicular transporters (Aim 1), establish simplified procedures for their monochrome and ‘multicolor’ labeling in 3D ultrastructure (Aim 2), and computational tools for automated segmentation and quantitative analysis of key pre- and post-synaptic metrics (Aim 3). Though these Aims are independently meritorious, by synthesizing them we aim to generate a complete toolkit that will allow investigators to render neurotransmitter-defined circuit connections into 3D ultrastructure datasets with automated quantitative assessment of key features of pre- and post-synaptic structure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synaptic and structural dysfunction are causally related to both the causes and symptoms of neuropsychiatric illness ranging from Alzheimer’s disease to addiction and depression. Modern advances in molecular genetics, engineering, materials, and computer sciences have created new opportunities to understand how brain dysfunction gives rise to disease. Here, we leverage these interdisciplinary advances to develop new probes, new methods, and new analysis pipelines to study the normal and pathological structure and function of synaptically coupled brain cells.",Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning.,9822844,RF1MH120685,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acetylcholine', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chelating Agents', 'Chemicals', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Deposition', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunoelectron Microscopy', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements', 'Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Optics', 'Oxides', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Purines', 'Recycling', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'Vesicle', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Western Blotting', 'addiction', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'light microscopy', 'materials science', 'monoamine', 'nanoscale', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neurotransmission', 'peer', 'polymerization', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'synaptic function', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",RF1,2019,2509965,-0.011210304081451867
"Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas Project Summary/Abstract Connectomics is a new field, created with the goal of densely or completely mapping the connections in the brain. Because this goal is at present only achievable for small organisms, connectomics has taken on two forms in the study of larger brains. Macroscale connectomics is used to describe the connections between brain areas, which in experimental animals is achieved with tracers, while humans it is typically pursued at a very coarse scale with diffusion imaging, a form of MRI. Microscale connectomics aims to create dense wiring diagrams of local circuits, small volumes of the brain with neurons that form rich networks within a local neighborhood. Macroscale connectomics lacks cellular resolution, while microscale connectomics can only reconstruct small volumes, with little information about the source of inputs entering the volume, or the targets of axons exiting it. We propose to develop a technique to bridge the gap between the microscale and the macroscale by creating experimental and analytical methods for mapping individual axons over long distances, concentrating on the largest 50% of myelinated axons (long-distance “wires”) in the brain. For the current RFA to develop “Tools to Facilitate High-Throughput Microconnectivity Analysis” we are specifically targeting one of the recommended goals, to “Develop a high-quality toolbox of methods for efficiently mapping and annotating projections” in the human brain. The method—based on high-resolution 3D imaging of antibody-stained axons—can be scaled to analyze entire brains, but here we propose to apply it to the posterior pole of a macaque brain, a large (~10 cm3) volume will contain >20 visual cortical areas. The goal is to trace most of the larger axons (>1 um) between these areas, thus creating a dense axonal connectomics data set from the cortical visual system, allowing us to examine not only the hierarchy of visual areas, but also the structure of computational maps. Ultimately, this approach will permit whole-brain analysis of axonal projections, with targeted examination of key circuits for microscale connectomics. While microscale connectomics of whole human brains will remain impossible for the foreseeable future, dense axonal mapping should be achievable in the next 5 to 10 years. This proposal offers a pathway towards this new type brain-wide anatomy: Axonal Connectomics. Project Narrative/Relevance This proposal will contribute to the fundamental question of how the brain is wired, in particular the pathways by which individual neurons communicate over long distances between different parts of the brain. One of the most promising treatments for a variety of brain disease—deep brain stimulation—is thought to work largely by activating these long distance “wires”, so a thorough understanding of their trajectories might have considerable long-term clinical importance.",Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas,9822860,RF1MH117820,"['3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Axon', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caliber', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Diffusion', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Occipital lobe', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain volume', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'gray matter', 'imaging approach', 'light microscopy', 'neurofilament protein H', 'nonhuman primate', 'petabyte', 'physical mapping', 'programs', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIMH,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2019,2312287,0.04233274533042571
"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9805657,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2019,231750,0.030201711672361277
"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9731533,R01EB026456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,622031,0.024862665974488746
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Longitudinal Analysis of the Dynamic Network Disruptions in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies has found that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be understood as a dysfunction syndrome where the structural and functional connectivity of the large-scale network are progressively disrupted by molecular pathomechanism that is not fully understood. The disruptions to the network exhibit dynamic patterns at different stages of AD, which holds valuable clues to understand AD progression. Current network computational tools are designed for cross-sectional data only, which is insufficient to maintain temporal consistency in investigating longitudinal network changes. To address this problem, we will develop the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis. Specifically, we will propose a learning-based approach to precisely quantify the evolution of brain network from noisy imaging data (Aim 1). Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique will be integrated to seek for the consistent longitudinal brain networks. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tool to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between the hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression (Aim 2). The outcome of this project will be the first longitudinal brain network analysis tool in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging fields. We will release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the network studies in other neuro diseases that show brain network dysfunction. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a set of efficient computational tools specifically for longitudinal brain network analysis. In order to accurately measure the connectivity strength, we propose a learning-based approach to find the intrinsic brain network from the noisy imaging data. Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique have been integrated into brain network optimization for preserving the longitudinal consistency. It is worth noting that our data-driven approach is free of the ad-hoc thresholding technique which may undermine the repeatability of discovery. To the best of our knowledge, our learning-based approach is the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis in neuroscience and neuroimaging field. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tools to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression.

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,9810689,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,780855,0.05012499926857403

"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function.

"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,9742727,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discount', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,183179,-0.024099447829013975
"A data science toolbox for analysis of Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI Project Summary/Abstract The connections between different brain regions play an important role in normal brain function. This project proposes to create an end-to-end pipeline for analysis of human white matter connections using “tractometry” methods. In tractometry, tissue properties are estimated in the long-range connections between remote brain regions. The project will focus on the analysis of the Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI dataset, which provides one of the largest available publicly available datasets of diffusion MRI from a sample of normal healthy individuals. Based on this dataset, we propose to create a normative distribution of tissue properties in the major white matter connections, to develop novel statistical methods to connect the properties of white matter connections to cognitive abilities, and to create visualization tools for further communication and exploration of the data. The tools created will be initially applied to the Human Connectome Project Dataset, but will also be useful in smaller studies on speciﬁc populations and in other large-scale datasets, such as the ABCD study. Project Narrative This project proposes to characterize the properties of long-range connections between human brain regions, using MRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Using novel data science tools that we will develop we will assemble a benchmark of the distribution of tissue properties in major brain connections, apply novel statistical methods that connect the properties of brain connections to cognitive abilities, and create visualization tools for further communication and exploration of this dataset and other similar datasets.",A data science toolbox for analysis of Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI,9886761,RF1MH121868,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual impairment', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biophysical properties', 'blind', 'brain tract', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive skill', 'connectome', 'data visualization', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'scale up', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,RF1,2019,707444,0.03771625986519789
"Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Resource (LONIR) PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The LONIR is focused on developing innovative solutions for the investigation of imaging, genetics, behavioral and clinical data. The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL The comprehensive suite of technologies include algorithmic and computational methods for image management, processing, data analysis and visualization.

"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9773019,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'pain sensitivity', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,461813,0.04350347712073537
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets these needs with well-documented and tested novel analyses using MEG and EEG in combination with anatomical MRI and intracranial EEG data.",BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging,9720885,R01EB026299,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Institution', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cloud storage', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'cortex mapping', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'graphical user interface', 'hands on instruction', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'magnetic field', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,637924,0.029479987813575737
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9824928,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,253798,0.017765325041835065
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing.

"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9733348,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual technology']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2019,379357,0.031864378193099396

However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9763674,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2019,312460,0.016000607660771857
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",9804370,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,128619,0.009084576762795839
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9789876,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,20717,0.01801369099389808
"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide.

"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9821596,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231602,0.007798029239098511
"Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial We estimate 250,000 new infants develop hydrocephalus, most commonly following neonatal infection, in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) each year. Most have poor access to treatment. We developed and validated a novel operative treatment for infant hydrocephalus combining endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) that avoids shunt dependence in the majority. Our prior collaborative work at CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda (CCHU) supported equipoise between shunt placement and ETV/CPC in regard to 5-year survival and development. That ETV/CPC prevents shunt dependence among those with no urgent access for shunt malfunction is compelling, but we do not know which treatment optimizes development. We seek to confirm the optimal treatment selection paradigm. Using CT-based measures we found that brain and CSF volume discriminated neurocognitive outcome, providing a promising objective measure of hydrocephalus treatment efficacy. Preliminary data from our R-21 and R01 funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01936272) have shown no important differences at one year in regard to safety, efficacy, developmental outcome, or brain growth Those achieving normal or near-normal brain volume by 1 year, regardless of preop volume, had the best outcome. The current proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1) test the hypothesis that endoscopic treatment of PIH is better than or equal to shunt placement in regard to five-year neurocognitive development; 2) further develop CCHU as a neuroscience research facility; 3) develop the in-country capacity for sustainable ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI imaging; 4) install optimized ULF-MRI at CCHU; 5) Correlate MRI-derived brain/CSF volume metrics with long-term neurocognitive development following PIH treatment. As planned, the RCT patient study cohort will undergo further developmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 24 months post- operatively along with repeat CT-based brain and CSF volume metrics. In the current proposal, developmental assessment will be conducted at 5 years post-treatment using the Vineland-III, as well as an assessment of quality of life. After developing Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) as an ULF-MRI demonstration and resource center, ULF-MRI will be installed at CCHU for evaluation as a volumetric and diagnostic tool compared to CT. Neurocognitive outcome will be correlated with pre- and post-operative MRI- based brain/CSF volumes and treatment modality. Extension of the study will determine whether non-inferiority of ETV/CPC to shunt in regard to developmental outcome and brain growth persists at 5 years post-treatment, whether MRI-based volume metrics effectively supplant CT-based measures, and whether brain and CSF volumetrics prove useful in guiding optimal clinical management. The proposed project will determine whether ETV/CPC is the preferred initial treatment and will further develop research capacity at CCHU. Project Narrative We have established neonatal postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH) as a major public health problem in East Africa for which there are two strategies of treatment – shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy + choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC), which we developed – with no definitive evidence supporting which therapy is optimal. Our randomized controlled trial of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH has shown no difference in success rate, developmental outcome or brain growth at one year following treatment, with better outcome among those demonstrating “catch-up” brain growth after treatment. We here propose extended follow up of the existing study cohort to analyze early childhood development at 5 years after treatment and to implement new sustainable ultra-low-field MRI technology for brain and CSF volume metrics to provide an evidence- based foundation for better treatment of such children.",Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial,9751092,R01HD085853,"['7 year old', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cauterize', 'Child', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Equipoise', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infrastructure', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neonatal', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,10000,0.015039988098748173
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9670105,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2019,202731,0.02465500164066308
"ADNI Psychometrics: fcMRI and Machine Learning Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the structural data we are already analyzing, and adds analyses of functional data we had not previously been planning to analyze. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for Aim 2. The new functional data analyses incorporate measurements of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data from resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data collected by ADNI. Those data enable the characterization of functional connectivity. There are many levels of correlation in the analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data, and another talented faculty member in Radiology has specific expertise in analyzing these data (T Madhyastha). Dr. Madhyastha will supervise analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data from the cognitively-defined subgroups of Aim 2, which will provide important additional information regarding whether the functional connectivity patterns of people in these subgroups are similar to or different from each other. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672, ""ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups.

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Within this congress, the Optics and the Brain Conference is specifically focused on cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that seek to increase fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on optics and the brain topics within this meeting.  The 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain conference was founded in 2015 in response to the USA BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project. These initiatives have identified the urgent need for new technologies that can probe the working brain across all levels from single neurons to entire behaving organisms. Optics offers a unique toolkit for multiscale imaging the living and intact brain, while new genetic labeling strategies provide optical contrast to neural function and optogenetics permits the control of cellular function with light. Optics and the Brain is thus an important, highly interdisciplinary area of research that combines broad aspects of neuroscience, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering. This year the program is adding more topics to be able to better explore new tools, the use of artificial intelligence in machine learning and technologies that will allow doctors to explore larger, deeper sections of the brain.  The general purpose of this congress with co-located meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international. In addition, this meeting provides an opportunity for students and early career professionals to present their work, participate in professional development activities, and to hear from and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers who represent the broad diversity of optics and the brain related research. Ultimately this meeting, where best-in-class research is presented and discussed will advance knowledge in the field of biomedical optics and biophotonics and propel technological development forward.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,0.05496579744680791
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9493548,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2018,163943,-0.002396221720614416
"Assessing the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Agency Project Summary Recent advances in neurotechnologies have provided us with the ability to modulate brain function by direct and indirect interventions. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one such intervention that has already been FDA-approved for certain disorders, and its use has already raised ethical questions about ways in which direct brain stimulation may affect personal identity, autonomy, authenticity and, more generally, agency. Thus far the neuroethical worries have been largely based on anecdotal clinical reports. Further neurotechnological interventions developed as part of the BRAIN initiative are bound to raise similar questions, but we lack a clear framework in which to think of the ethical consequences of these interventions. The overall goal of this project is to articulate such a framework, to enable us to better evaluate and respond to the neuroethical challenges raised by our abilities to alter brain function. The more concrete objectives of our proposal are to 1) develop comprehensive assessment tools to measure changes in agency due to direct brain interventions, 2) to use this tool to assess changes in agency due to brain interventions using DBS patient populations as a test case; and 3) to develop a database to house the data we acquire with these tools to allow us to catalogue the effects and side effects of DBS. This will also make it possible to correlate the effects of DBS with electrode placement and white matter tractography, enabling better prediction of outcomes and aid in understanding of the mechanisms by which DBS works. We will analyze this data machine with machine learning methods to inform a more comprehensive neuroethical analysis of how brain interventions affect agency. Our approach is innovative in that it applies neurophilosophical insights about agency and employs deep learning algorithms in constructing and evaluating these assessment instruments. This contribution is significant in that it will provide a broad based assessment tool and database that will be a resource for researchers and clinicians using DBS, which could be used to improve therapeutic approaches and informed consent. The data will also inform a framework for further neuroethical thought about brain interventions, allowing us to better identify, articulate and measure changes on “dimensions of agency.” Finally, the approach is generalizable, and thus could be adapted for use with other brain intervention techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or pharmacological treatments.   Project Narrative: We aim to develop a computerized assessment tool (the Agency Assessment Tool, AAT) to be used by clinicians prior to and after brain interventions to measure changes in agency along multiple dimensions. We will also develop an anonymous database coupled to the AAT that will constitute a central repository for data documenting the effects of DBS. Machine learning methods will be used to build predictive models from the AAT data in order to provide neuroethically relevant predictive and diagnostic information about the effects of brain interventions on agency. ",Assessing the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Agency,9609947,RF1MH117813,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bioethics', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'FDA approved', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroethics', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'neurotechnology', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'preimplantation', 'tool', 'tractography', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,RF1,2018,239475,0.0532494573005613
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9422606,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,451650,0.005608890091182621
"Deep Learning for Connectomics Project Summary/Abstract The brain contains a vast number of neurons that are connected with each other through synapses, thereby forming a complex anatomical network that mediates information ﬂow within the brain. The brain “wiring diagram” will be a foundational tool for elucidating the function and dysfunction of brains. Electron microscopy (EM) is widely considered to be the gold standard for neuronal level circuit recon- struction. Currently, a major and serious bottleneck in this ﬁeld is image segmentation and reconstruc- tion. It is estimated that the data analysis accuracy and throughput are lagging behind data acquisition by orders of magnitude. This project aims at dramatically improving the accuracy and throughput of brain EM image analysis, thereby enabling accurate and efﬁcient reconstruction of neuronal level brain maps. Speciﬁcally, this project is built up on the recent success in deep learning methods, which are dominant tools for EM image analysis. A central and unresolved challenge of using deep learning for segmentation is how to achieve the conﬂicting goals of integrating sufﬁcient contextual features while preserving full-resolution information. This project will develop a novel residual encoder-decoder model to achieve these two goals simultaneously (Aim 1). In current deep learning segmentation methods, the labels of each pixel are predicted independently. To fully consider the brain topological structure and couple the predictions of spatially adjacent pixels, this project will develop a hybrid recurrent and convo- lutional network model (Aim 2). In this model, the recurrent network is integrated with the convolutional network to incorporate the multi-dimensional structural information. When combined with Aim 1, these methods are expected to dramatically improve the accuracy of EM image segmentation. In most cur- rent deep learning segmentation methods, the training and/or prediction stages require the extraction of patches centered on each pixel. This step forms a bottleneck that limits the overall throughput. This project will develop novel techniques to achieve whole-image training and prediction (Aim 3). These approaches will enable very efﬁcient training and segmentation, thereby dramatically increasing the throughput of EM image analysis. Project narrative Wiring diagrams of the brain circuits serve as a foundational tool for studying brain function and dys- function. This project aims at developing advanced computational methods for boosting the accuracy and throughput of brain circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy images.

"Construction of a high-resolution human tractography atlas and its related toolbox PROJECT SUMMARY Mapping the human connectome and exploring its characteristics is one of the largest endeavors in the neuroscience field, but a detailed tractography atlas that provides the 3D trajectories in a standard space has yet to be constructed and validated. A tractography atlas can provide neuroanatomical insight into the structural organization of the human brain and allow for modeling, simulation, and confirmation of cortical connections to facilitate the new development of treatment and intervention for brain diseases. In this study, we propose to construct a high spatial and angular resolution tractography atlas using a large sample of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) diffusion MRI data, averaging them into a template for fiber tracking, validating the tracks by post-mortem Klingler microdissection on 100 cadavers under a neurosurgery microscope digitized using high resolution 3D scanners, and building a deep learning toolbox that allows for automatic track recognition in individuals. This study will construct the most detailed and accurate tractography of human connectome and provide a novel toolbox for future HCP data analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will construct an atlas of human brain fiber pathways and a related toolbox for track- specific analysis, aiming to understand the structural characteristics of brain connections in healthy individuals and provide track-specific analysis for brain imaging data.",Construction of a high-resolution human tractography atlas and its related toolbox,9771640,R56MH113634,"['Algorithms', 'Aphasia', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cadaver', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Microdissection', 'Microscope', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'experience', 'human data', 'human subject', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tractography', 'virtual', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,452250,0.056636244642540225
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9455790,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,377627,0.02294148011852247
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9574149,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,579883,-0.0284012932265298
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will advance our understanding of the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing.

"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9548265,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,1,0.012909549749411156
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Netherlands', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive task', 'disability', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,0.03548170591501919
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9591465,R24MH114806,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Capital', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Software Design', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validity of Results', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'investigator training', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'software as a service', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2018,507643,0.04679160730641234
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION PROJECT DESCRIPTION Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our proposal promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art “Connectome Skyra”, an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of “Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering”, which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain’s white matter tracts. Our proposal benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter. The BCI intervention would complement traditional speech therapy using behavioral methods. The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few. Project narrative The goal of this project is to develop brain-computer interface technology to optimize brain function on an individual basis. This could have therapeutic applications to many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.",Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering,9530270,R21DC016353,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurologic', 'Normal Range', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stroke', 'Stuttering', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'improved', 'indexing', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2018,216658,-0.04030868271490898
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,0.039638544667856664
"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'cost', 'critical period', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'myelination', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,0.030595915875285033
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics.

"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9565669,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'member', 'multiple omics', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2018,1293101,0.061541165131260955
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,0.018294828741985875

For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9523223,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144298,0.020210212443756106
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes.

"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9518014,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,580306,-0.027053767809893537
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9594591,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,561118,0.04420062861426629
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,0.03952031263535452
"Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis MS damages white matter pathways that connect brain regions, i.e. the structural connectome (SC), disrupting flow of electrical signals, i.e. the functional connectome (FC), causing cognitive and physical disability. Howev- er, the burden of disease in the brain is not always proportional to an individual's disability. How the brain com- pensates for damage in resilient patients remains a mystery, making it difficult to develop accurate prognoses and treatments that can leverage this process in less fortunate patients. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to create individualized therapies based on the brain's natural resiliency mechanism or to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery. The thriving field of brain connectivity network analysis, or con- nectomics, provides a promising tool with which to capture, model and understand mechanisms of resiliency. The long-term goal is to develop novel, personalized rehabilitation methods that mimic and enhance the brain's resiliency process to restore cognitive and physical abilities after damage due to neurological conditions. The overall objective of this work is to identify connectome-based imaging biomarkers of resiliency in MS, i.e. those that separate patients with high disease burden and low disability (high-adapters) from those with similar dis- ease burden and high disability (low-adapters). Our central hypothesis, the functional rerouting hypothesis, states that resilient patients' brains recover from injury by restoring normal functional connections using alter- nate white matter pathways to circumvent irrevocably damaged structural connections. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary work in simulated studies, severe brain injury and mild to moderate trau- matic brain injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that insight into the brain's ability to compensate for injury would allow for more accurate prognostication and enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: to identify global and regional metrics of the 1) structural and functional connectomes and 2) structure- function relationship between the connectomes that differentiate high-adapting and low-adapting MS patients. We will collect functional, diffusion and anatomical MRIs from 25 controls and 42 high- and 42 low-adapting MS patients to extract structural and functional connectomes and test central hypotheses. The approach is in- novative, in the applicant's opinion, as it implements cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a novel mathematical model to formalize the relationship between structural and functional connectomes and capture network-level functional rerouting in resiliency to MS-related damage. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have broad translational impact on the development of more accurate prognoses as well as targeted, personalized treatments for patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to open up new horizons for innovative therapies, e.g. through non-invasive brain stimulation, that can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with debilitating neurological disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying resiliency to multiple sclerosis related damage is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis,9572444,R21NS104634,"['Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'connectome', 'disability', 'driving force', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'response', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2018,211875,0.03215785247277939
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,0.036288906204500856
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,0.01859262900551805
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG? ?source? ?dynamics? ?and? ?results? ?of? ?existing? ?research? ?using? ?fMRI? ?and? ?other? ?brain? ?imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics,9597164,R01NS047293,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Mail', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Links List', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Paper', 'Plug-in', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'mathematical methods', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'online course', 'open source', 'research study', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'teaching laboratory', 'tool', 'wiki']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,604808,0.05113463558685843
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",9615324,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,21379,0.020714203042376575
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others. Project Narrative  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allow the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded with high spatial and temporal resolution.

"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction. Second, we hope to improve computer performance by using insights into how the brain computes.",CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space,9692942,R01DC017695,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Burn injury', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Dreams', 'Drosophila genus', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfaction Disorders', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning community', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'red wine', 'response', 'theories']",NIDCD,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2018,481000,0.028203353305037048

"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9574362,R01EB026456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radiofrequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,685473,0.024862665974488746
"Longitudinal Analysis of the Dynamic Network Disruptions in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies has found that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be understood as a dysfunction syndrome where the structural and functional connectivity of the large-scale network are progressively disrupted by molecular pathomechanism that is not fully understood. The disruptions to the network exhibit dynamic patterns at different stages of AD, which holds valuable clues to understand AD progression. Current network computational tools are designed for cross-sectional data only, which is insufficient to maintain temporal consistency in investigating longitudinal network changes. To address this problem, we will develop the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis. Specifically, we will propose a learning-based approach to precisely quantify the evolution of brain network from noisy imaging data (Aim 1). Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique will be integrated to seek for the consistent longitudinal brain networks. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tool to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between the hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression (Aim 2). The outcome of this project will be the first longitudinal brain network analysis tool in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging fields. We will release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the network studies in other neuro diseases that show brain network dysfunction. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a set of efficient computational tools specifically for longitudinal brain network analysis. In order to accurately measure the connectivity strength, we propose a learning-based approach to find the intrinsic brain network from the noisy imaging data. Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique have been integrated into brain network optimization for preserving the longitudinal consistency. It is worth noting that our data-driven approach is free of the ad-hoc thresholding technique which may undermine the repeatability of discovery. To the best of our knowledge, our learning-based approach is the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis in neuroscience and neuroimaging field. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tools to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression.

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC .

"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder(MDD), bipolar disorders(BD) and schizophrenia(SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason lies in that most neuroimaging “prediction” studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple “correlation” relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, or lack of multi-site validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with references, and sparse regression etc. can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, which can be promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers, which goes beyond a more descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain diseases. We will develop 3 novel data- driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment(in SZ) or epigenetic factors (miR-132 dysregulation in MDD) may affect covarying brain function and structure, which uses different clinical measures as reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction model that is able to identify imaging biomarkers for precise, individualized prediction of clinical outcomes, e.g., remission status of MDD patients after Electroconvulsive Treatment(ECT). 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep neural networks(DNN) combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to classify multiple group of psychiatric disorders by using functional connectivity measures, and to trace back the most predictive functional networks from the black box of deep learning by LRP. All above proposed methods will be applied to the big data containing multimodal imaging and behavioral information(n=5000) pooled from existing studies, to investigate biomarkers that can help solve specific clinical difficulties. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, lead to earlier and more effective interventions, suggesting a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep neural networks, supervised learning and dynamic functional information, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, thus identify replicable and precise biomarkers that are able to predict individual clinical measures and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting a large imaging and behavioral dataset (n~5000) to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9733448,R56MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'CREB1 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R56,2018,453304,0.026720619124417148
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9546678,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual variation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,381250,-0.022349988834748938

This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9552903,R44GM125438,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tumor resection', 'clinical imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health care settings', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2018,740001,0.017242270053305725
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of toe', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'exposed human population', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.016791321007709883
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9529636,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'pain sensitivity', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,576642,0.04350347712073537
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets these needs with well-documented and tested novel analyses using MEG and EEG in combination with anatomical MRI and intracranial EEG data.",BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging,9533856,R01EB026299,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Institution', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cloud storage', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'cortex mapping', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'distributed data', 'electric field', 'graphical user interface', 'hands on instruction', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'magnetic field', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,678920,0.029479987813575737
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9456759,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2018,202835,0.02465500164066308
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training.

"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9568023,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2018,386960,0.031864378193099396
"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9622419,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2018,386013,0.016000607660771857
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9615743,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,21212,0.01801369099389808
"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide.

"Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data Project Summary / Abstract Understanding brain function is key to improving health care and advancing a number of scientific initiatives. The treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS is becoming increasingly important as the current US population ages and life expectancies increase. The costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated at over $200 billion in 2016 alone, not to mention the human devastation that these diseases incur. Autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment are just a few more of the critically important health concerns related to brain function. Cognitive science is also at the forefront of research into computational and autonomous systems, with the potential to revolutionize human computer interaction and tackle emerging global challenges. As a result of these and other significant opportunities the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Presidential initiative was created to improve the future health and competitiveness of the nation, with the fundamental goal of accelerating brain research. Consistent with this goal, the brain research community has developed the Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB) file format and specification to support large-scale collaboration and research. This open format was created in 2014 and is already making an impact on cellular-based neurophysiology, with organizations such as the Allen Institute for Brain Science generating and sharing datasets such as the Allen Brain Observatory and the Allen Cell Types Database. Although this preliminary work is promising, progress in the research community is slowed by a lack of software tools to readily browse, process, analyse, and visualize NWB data, while promoting replicability. Thus this work aims to to produce such tools in support of the BRAIN initiative and other large-scale brain research programs by supporting and growing the NWB community. The work proposed here addresses three important workflows in cellular-based neurophysiology: o​ ptical physiology to image neurons under stimuli, silicon probe recordings to detect spike events from the surface of the cortex down through deeps​ structures, and​ in vitro slice electrophysiology to record t​ ime-varying stimulus and electrical response from a neuron​. Novel multiscale software tools will be created to enable efficient browsing, processing, analysis, and visualization of NWB-based brain data; linking experimental stimuli to observed responses. Conversion utilities will also be developed to convert existing data into NWB form. As the data is large, complex, and may be distributed across many sites, the software tools will be web-based, enabling researchers to remotely access and process data in a reproducible manner, and to use scalable cloud computing resources. The software will be released under open source licences and will be placed under formal software process to facilitate sharing across the research community. The tools will be conceived and created with the help of Allen scientists, who will also perform final validation using these three workflows. Project Narrative This research is aimed at better understanding brain function. Such knowledge may lead to improved therapies for degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS; and provide new treatments for autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment. These studies of brain science may also yield significant insights into computing areas such as robotics and computer vision, thereby providing both healthcare and economic benefits.",Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data,9515062,R44MH115731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Pain management', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'community based participatory research', 'computer human interaction', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'distributed data', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'file format', 'hackathon', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'web interface', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2018,728425,0.07057090802311082
"Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial We estimate 250,000 new infants develop hydrocephalus, most commonly following neonatal infection, in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) each year. Most have poor access to treatment. We developed and validated a novel operative treatment for infant hydrocephalus combining endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) that avoids shunt dependence in the majority. Our prior collaborative work at CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda (CCHU) supported equipoise between shunt placement and ETV/CPC in regard to 5-year survival and development. That ETV/CPC prevents shunt dependence among those with no urgent access for shunt malfunction is compelling, but we do not know which treatment optimizes development. We seek to confirm the optimal treatment selection paradigm. Using CT-based measures we found that brain and CSF volume discriminated neurocognitive outcome, providing a promising objective measure of hydrocephalus treatment efficacy. Preliminary data from our R-21 and R01 funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01936272) have shown no important differences at one year in regard to safety, efficacy, developmental outcome, or brain growth Those achieving normal or near-normal brain volume by 1 year, regardless of preop volume, had the best outcome. The current proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1) test the hypothesis that endoscopic treatment of PIH is better than or equal to shunt placement in regard to five-year neurocognitive development; 2) further develop CCHU as a neuroscience research facility; 3) develop the in-country capacity for sustainable ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI imaging; 4) install optimized ULF-MRI at CCHU; 5) Correlate MRI-derived brain/CSF volume metrics with long-term neurocognitive development following PIH treatment. As planned, the RCT patient study cohort will undergo further developmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 24 months post- operatively along with repeat CT-based brain and CSF volume metrics. In the current proposal, developmental assessment will be conducted at 5 years post-treatment using the Vineland-III, as well as an assessment of quality of life. After developing Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) as an ULF-MRI demonstration and resource center, ULF-MRI will be installed at CCHU for evaluation as a volumetric and diagnostic tool compared to CT. Neurocognitive outcome will be correlated with pre- and post-operative MRI- based brain/CSF volumes and treatment modality. Extension of the study will determine whether non-inferiority of ETV/CPC to shunt in regard to developmental outcome and brain growth persists at 5 years post-treatment, whether MRI-based volume metrics effectively supplant CT-based measures, and whether brain and CSF volumetrics prove useful in guiding optimal clinical management. The proposed project will determine whether ETV/CPC is the preferred initial treatment and will further develop research capacity at CCHU. Project Narrative We have established neonatal postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH) as a major public health problem in East Africa for which there are two strategies of treatment – shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy + choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC), which we developed – with no definitive evidence supporting which therapy is optimal. Our randomized controlled trial of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH has shown no difference in success rate, developmental outcome or brain growth at one year following treatment, with better outcome among those demonstrating “catch-up” brain growth after treatment. We here propose extended follow up of the existing study cohort to analyze early childhood development at 5 years after treatment and to implement new sustainable ultra-low-field MRI technology for brain and CSF volume metrics to provide an evidence- based foundation for better treatment of such children.",Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial,9553835,R01HD085853,"['7 year old', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cauterize', 'Child', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Equipoise', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infection', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neonatal', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,10000,0.015039988098748173
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9307803,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,549838,0.05496579744680791
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9272937,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2017,186993,-0.002396221720614416
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9213309,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,451650,0.005608890091182621
"Deep Learning for Connectomics Project Summary/Abstract The brain contains a vast number of neurons that are connected with each other through synapses, thereby forming a complex anatomical network that mediates information ﬂow within the brain. The brain “wiring diagram” will be a foundational tool for elucidating the function and dysfunction of brains. Electron microscopy (EM) is widely considered to be the gold standard for neuronal level circuit recon- struction. Currently, a major and serious bottleneck in this ﬁeld is image segmentation and reconstruc- tion. It is estimated that the data analysis accuracy and throughput are lagging behind data acquisition by orders of magnitude. This project aims at dramatically improving the accuracy and throughput of brain EM image analysis, thereby enabling accurate and efﬁcient reconstruction of neuronal level brain maps. Speciﬁcally, this project is built up on the recent success in deep learning methods, which are dominant tools for EM image analysis. A central and unresolved challenge of using deep learning for segmentation is how to achieve the conﬂicting goals of integrating sufﬁcient contextual features while preserving full-resolution information. This project will develop a novel residual encoder-decoder model to achieve these two goals simultaneously (Aim 1). In current deep learning segmentation methods, the labels of each pixel are predicted independently. To fully consider the brain topological structure and couple the predictions of spatially adjacent pixels, this project will develop a hybrid recurrent and convo- lutional network model (Aim 2). In this model, the recurrent network is integrated with the convolutional network to incorporate the multi-dimensional structural information. When combined with Aim 1, these methods are expected to dramatically improve the accuracy of EM image segmentation. In most cur- rent deep learning segmentation methods, the training and/or prediction stages require the extraction of patches centered on each pixel. This step forms a bottleneck that limits the overall throughput. This project will develop novel techniques to achieve whole-image training and prediction (Aim 3). These approaches will enable very efﬁcient training and segmentation, thereby dramatically increasing the throughput of EM image analysis. Project narrative Wiring diagrams of the brain circuits serve as a foundational tool for studying brain function and dys- function. This project aims at developing advanced computational methods for boosting the accuracy and throughput of brain circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy images. Comparative circuit analysis of normal and disease brains would shed light on how brain circuits go awry in psychiatric and neurological disorders.",Deep Learning for Connectomics,9371358,R21NS102828,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'comparative', 'data acquisition', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanometer', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,222279,0.028408253436153042

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9244854,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,30367,0.02294148011852247
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9419223,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,223908,0.039638544667856664
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,0.018294828741985875
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9324260,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'base', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,101908,0.02991528200336587
"Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stages, poses a significant burden to the community and health care system. Several other pathologic processes often co-exist with AD pathology. Characterizing the multi-faceted aspects of brain changes present in aging and (prodromal) AD not only provides insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes, such as amyloid deposition, small vessel ischemic disease(SVID), and neurodegeneration or functional change, but also leads to biomarkers of these pathologic processes. In this proposal, we aim to capture the heterogeneity of various imaging patterns that reflect pathologic processes occurring with aging and prodromal AD, by applying state of the art heterogeneity analysis machine learning methods recently developed in our laboratory to multi-faceted imaging data (structural MRI, resting state functional MRI, amyloid imaging). These methods allow us to quantify the different ways/patterns in which an individual can fall off the normative brain aging trajectories. Our goal is to arrive at a new “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), each dimension of which will reflect a different pattern of brain alterations, hence capturing the underlying neuroanatomical, neurofunctional and neuropathological heterogeneity in quantifiable and replicable metrics. Moreover, we aim to link these neuroimaging phenotypes with neurocognitive phenotypes, as well as with progression from cognitively normal aging to MCI and to dementia. This will allow us to place each individual into a new dimensional brain coordinate system of aging and map his/her trajectory, as well to determine predictive indices emanating from multi-parametric imaging data. Prior to achieving these aims, we will strengthen and apply various imaging harmonization methods, which are critical in ensuring that data across studies and scanners can be integrated in a constructive way. In particular, Aim1 will apply inter-site imaging harmonization methods, and hence develop a platform that will allow us to integrate multi-parametric imaging datasets from more than 10,000 participants to several studies spanning ages 45 to 89; we will therefore form a large multi-modal imaging database capturing the heterogeneity of normal brain aging and prodromal AD. Aim 2 will use machine learning methods to integrate spatial patterns of brain atrophy, SVID, Aβ deposition and functional connectivity in this population, and will derive normative brain aging curves. Aim 3 will use state of the art semi-supervised learning methods to disentangle the heterogeneity of imaging patterns distinguishing resilient from advanced brain aging: this will lead to the dimensional system (iSTAGING) capturing the diverse dimensions/patterns of advanced (non-resilient) age-related brain change relative to resilient brain aging, which reflect underlying neuropathological processes. Aim 4 will relate iSTAGING coordinates and longitudinal trajectories to cognition, risk factors, and clinical progression from normal cognition to MCI to dementia, in order to further elucidate the clinical correlates of these neuroimaging dimensions. Project narrative This proposal pools imaging data from 11 different studies, with a total of more than 10,000 individuals of ages 45 to 95, aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of brain aging. State of the art imaging harmonization, pattern analysis and machine learning methods will be used to derive normative brain aging curves, and to characterize the heterogeneity of deviations from these curves in people with resilient and accelerated brain aging. Moreover, we aim to relate these imaging patterns to cognitive performance. We will eventually derive and “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), allowing us to place any individual's scans into a quantitative measurement system and plot his/her trajectories over time.","Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis",9211062,RF1AG054409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'abeta deposition', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'care systems', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive performance', 'community burden', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'frontier', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'pathological aging', 'predictive marker', 'quantitative imaging', 'resilience', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RF1,2017,3791182,-0.03933502512014137
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9413774,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2017,1247018,0.061541165131260955
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9305153,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,587873,-0.027053767809893537
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9310000,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,144298,0.020210212443756106
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset.

"Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis MS damages white matter pathways that connect brain regions, i.e. the structural connectome (SC), disrupting flow of electrical signals, i.e. the functional connectome (FC), causing cognitive and physical disability. Howev- er, the burden of disease in the brain is not always proportional to an individual's disability. How the brain com- pensates for damage in resilient patients remains a mystery, making it difficult to develop accurate prognoses and treatments that can leverage this process in less fortunate patients. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to create individualized therapies based on the brain's natural resiliency mechanism or to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery. The thriving field of brain connectivity network analysis, or con- nectomics, provides a promising tool with which to capture, model and understand mechanisms of resiliency. The long-term goal is to develop novel, personalized rehabilitation methods that mimic and enhance the brain's resiliency process to restore cognitive and physical abilities after damage due to neurological conditions. The overall objective of this work is to identify connectome-based imaging biomarkers of resiliency in MS, i.e. those that separate patients with high disease burden and low disability (high-adapters) from those with similar dis- ease burden and high disability (low-adapters). Our central hypothesis, the functional rerouting hypothesis, states that resilient patients' brains recover from injury by restoring normal functional connections using alter- nate white matter pathways to circumvent irrevocably damaged structural connections. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary work in simulated studies, severe brain injury and mild to moderate trau- matic brain injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that insight into the brain's ability to compensate for injury would allow for more accurate prognostication and enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: to identify global and regional metrics of the 1) structural and functional connectomes and 2) structure- function relationship between the connectomes that differentiate high-adapting and low-adapting MS patients. We will collect functional, diffusion and anatomical MRIs from 25 controls and 42 high- and 42 low-adapting MS patients to extract structural and functional connectomes and test central hypotheses. The approach is in- novative, in the applicant's opinion, as it implements cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a novel mathematical model to formalize the relationship between structural and functional connectomes and capture network-level functional rerouting in resiliency to MS-related damage. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have broad translational impact on the development of more accurate prognoses as well as targeted, personalized treatments for patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to open up new horizons for innovative therapies, e.g. through non-invasive brain stimulation, that can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with debilitating neurological disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying resiliency to multiple sclerosis related damage is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis,9435991,R21NS104634,"['Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'connectome', 'disability', 'driving force', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'response', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2017,254250,0.03215785247277939
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,0.03952031263535452
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,0.01859262900551805
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9372271,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,481714,0.012909549749411156
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics.

"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment.

"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data.

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction.

"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9308020,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,492125,0.0358018449373213
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9328902,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.016791321007709883
"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9360120,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,378750,-0.022349988834748938
"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9409171,R44GM125438,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Preservation', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tumor resection', 'clinical imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2017,749900,0.017242270053305725
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9348634,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,590821,0.04350347712073537
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of electrophysiological brain data is now ongoing a shift from measurement and visualization of individual channel signals (in the 'recording channel space') to visualizing and interpreting the data directly within a suitable inverse model representing activity reaching the electrodes by volume conduction from a set of effective data sources in native 'brain source space'. An equivalent shift, via the development and exploitation of an appropriate inverse imaging model, made possible the phenomenon of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the electrophysiological inverse problem is still difficult, dramatic progress has been and is being made through combined use of multimodal imaging and modern statistical signal processing methods. Recovering the considerable degree of spatial source resolution available in high-density scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological data, while retaining its natural advantage over other functional imaging methods in temporal resolution, has begun to yield a steady stream of new information about patterns of distributed brain processing supporting human behavior and experience. Relative to other brain imaging modalities, EEG has substantial and increasing cost and mobility advantages, making promotion of new EEG methods for source space analysis of increasing interest and importance for brain and health research. However, applying new source signal and signal processing models to electrophysiological data is complex and increasingly involves application of modern mathematical methods whose details are not within the training of most health research professionals. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University of California San Diego, began as a set of EEG data analysis running on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) released on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now, more than ten years later, the EEGLAB reference paper (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) has over 2,350 Google scholar citations (increasing at above 1 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links over 5,000 researchers, the news list over 9,000, and a recent survey of 687 researcher respondents reports EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis worldwide. EEGLAB is thus now a de facto standard supporting a wide range of EEG and other electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs. At least 35 EEGLAB plug-in toolsets have now been released by researchers from many laboratories. Under NIH PAR 11-028 we propose renewal funding to further develop and maintain the EEGLAB software framework. We propose new and better tools for brain source and source network modeling and localization, an expanded online EEGLAB course and workshop, better statistical inference modeling of group data, and new support for automated source decomposition, measure computation, data duration, and data sharing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data is now accelerating from measuring and visualizing individual scalp channel signals to directly visualizing and interpreting their brain sources. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University Of California San Diego (UCSD), supports a large number of EEG and related electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs.

"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9265841,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2017,202512,0.02465500164066308
"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built.

"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9618453,R01NS063399,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,273292,0.02294148011852247
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9562203,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,162344,0.03283266568783613

In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9332389,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,400000,0.03283266568783613
"Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data Project Summary / Abstract Understanding brain function is key to improving health care and advancing a number of scientific initiatives. The treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS is becoming increasingly important as the current US population ages and life expectancies increase. The costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated at over $200 billion in 2016 alone, not to mention the human devastation that these diseases incur. Autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment are just a few more of the critically important health concerns related to brain function. Cognitive science is also at the forefront of research into computational and autonomous systems, with the potential to revolutionize human computer interaction and tackle emerging global challenges. As a result of these and other significant opportunities the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Presidential initiative was created to improve the future health and competitiveness of the nation, with the fundamental goal of accelerating brain research. Consistent with this goal, the brain research community has developed the Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB) file format and specification to support large-scale collaboration and research. This open format was created in 2014 and is already making an impact on cellular-based neurophysiology, with organizations such as the Allen Institute for Brain Science generating and sharing datasets such as the Allen Brain Observatory and the Allen Cell Types Database. Although this preliminary work is promising, progress in the research community is slowed by a lack of software tools to readily browse, process, analyse, and visualize NWB data, while promoting replicability. Thus this work aims to to produce such tools in support of the BRAIN initiative and other large-scale brain research programs by supporting and growing the NWB community. The work proposed here addresses three important workflows in cellular-based neurophysiology: o​ ptical physiology to image neurons under stimuli, silicon probe recordings to detect spike events from the surface of the cortex down through deeps​ structures, and​ in vitro slice electrophysiology to record t​ ime-varying stimulus and electrical response from a neuron​. Novel multiscale software tools will be created to enable efficient browsing, processing, analysis, and visualization of NWB-based brain data; linking experimental stimuli to observed responses. Conversion utilities will also be developed to convert existing data into NWB form. As the data is large, complex, and may be distributed across many sites, the software tools will be web-based, enabling researchers to remotely access and process data in a reproducible manner, and to use scalable cloud computing resources. The software will be released under open source licences and will be placed under formal software process to facilitate sharing across the research community. The tools will be conceived and created with the help of Allen scientists, who will also perform final validation using these three workflows. Project Narrative This research is aimed at better understanding brain function. Such knowledge may lead to improved therapies for degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS; and provide new treatments for autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment. These studies of brain science may also yield significant insights into computing areas such as robotics and computer vision, thereby providing both healthcare and economic benefits.",Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data,9409114,R44MH115731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Pain management', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'community based participatory research', 'computer human interaction', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'design', 'distributed data', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'file format', 'hackathon', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'web interface', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2017,747542,0.07057090802311082
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,0.05496579744680791
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.        ",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9108475,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2016,190952,-0.002396221720614416
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9058040,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,451650,0.005608890091182621
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,9107487,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,230351,-0.018432702958145735

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts.

"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8996729,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,308040,0.02294148011852247
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9155025,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain tract', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'evaluation/testing', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2016,500696,0.02991528200336587
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,0.018294828741985875
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.            ","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9150327,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'information organization', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,604285,-0.027053767809893537
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9099840,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,144298,0.020210212443756106
"Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ADHD is has long been believed to include brain-based pathophysiology, but the newest approaches to describing atypical brain organization in ADHD are just emerging and are thus far limited to cross-sectional studies. The present study has as its principal aims three objectives. First, it aims to characterize ADHD's brain organization longitudinally from childhood through adolescence, during a period of time in which ADHD youth enter very high risk for negative life outcomes, poor health outcomes, and comorbid behavioral, mood, and substance use disorders. In particular, the project aims to determine specified circuits, unique brain networks, and brain wide topological properties that relate to clinical course and outcome. Second, the proposal aims to bridge these developmental brain features with an enriched conception of phenotype, examining symptom domains, comorbidity, and measures of executive, reward, and emotional functioning in relation to specified brain metrics and targets. Third, it seeks to move the field forward in regard to clinica prediction by considering heterogeneity in two ways. One way is to examine novel typologies of ADHD based on differential brain organization across development. The other way is to utilize multiple methods to enhance prediction of clinical course. The significance of this effort lies bot in its unprecedented ability to characterize ADHD neurobiology over time with methods of brain characterization that have not been examined in ADHD longitudinally in this way before, and in its effort to move brain imaging into the realm of clinical prediction using a longitudinal design. The project is innovative in regard to implementing network and topology features of brain analysis in a multi-wave design, and tightly linking these to well defined, multi-level clinical course. The approach entails tracking of an already developed novel cohort of 376 children in a cross-lagged longitudinal design, enabling characterization of development from age 7-19 years. Brain organization will be operationalized with both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional connectivity. Youth will be characterized annually in relation to clinical symptoms, comorbidity, impairment, cognitive functioning, reward discounting, and emotion regulation and functioning. Analytic approaches will span brain circuit, network, and topological measurements using novel graph theoretical analyses to characterize brain systems. Clinical prediction will be undertaken using machine learning methodologies. Clinical typologies will be evaluated using both novel community detection procedures and more standard mixture model analysis of brain features. Finally, latent class trajectory models will be used to identify distint developmental types of ADHD if they exist. The prior grant period has been productive and this work builds on those findings to strengthen inference regarding the relation of brain organization to ADHD clinical features, course, and outcome. The Aims directly match key priorities of the NIMH strategic plan. If successful, the project hopes to break the impasse facing the field with regard to clinical utility of the growing grasp of atypical brain physiology in ADHD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much has been learned about brain correlates of ADHD, but this work has not yet affected clinical practice. The present project would characterize individual variation in ADHD brain development and attempt to use those findings to enhance clinical prediction. It thus aims to move the field closer to clinical application of brain imaging information of ADHD.",Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years,9208912,R56MH086654,"['19 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Conceptions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Typology', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'discounting', 'emotion regulation', 'graph theory', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'time use']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,769969,0.022509448168892048
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases.

"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology and has the potential to be applied to analyze a wide range of scientific problems beyond brain imaging data analysis.",Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience,8998688,R01MH102339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'study population', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'web services']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368829,0.05738209382031656
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment. These efforts have created the recruitment pool and datasets that are needed for LSM. The career enhancement will provide the training needed to leverage these resources, thereby augmenting the candidate's program of research and career trajectory. The overarching objectives are to: (1) retool the skills of the candidate to infuse LSM into her program of speech-language research, (2) seed data sharing and data science partnerships to boost the candidate's leadership of WPPR as a national resource, and (3) advance understanding of LSM methods and the neural substrates for speech and language to improve the knowledge base of the candidate and other investigators. The candidate proposes a synergistic set of activities. Didactic activities will give training in machie learning and brain image computing, scholarly travel experiences will afford opportunities to network with speech-language researchers and data scientists whose work is relevant for LSM, and two research studies will provide a hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire, apply, and extend LSM methods under the guidance of a superb mentoring team. Study 1 will use univariate and multivariate LSM analysis to investigate the neural substrates of chronic Broca's aphasia and the factors that influence the reproducibility of LSM results. Study 2 will develop and evaluate a workflow for automated lesion segmentation, using a software platform (3D Slicer) that involves two NIH-supported data science centers. Overall, the career enhancement will retool the skills, research network, and knowledge base of an established investigator, allowing the candidate to significantly augment her program of speech-language research and advance the utility of WPPR as a national resource for speech-language research.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9170673,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyped Behavior', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2016,377500,-0.022349988834748938
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction. Although fMRI studies of brain function have primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of perceptual or cognitive tasks, there is growing consensus that cognitive functions emerge as a result of dynamic context-dependent interactions between multiple brain areas. Developing new computational methods for investigating causal interactions in fMRI data has therefore taken added significance; the overall goal of this proposal is to address this critical need by developing new methods for studying causal interactions and brain connectivity between distributed brain regions during cognition.",Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction,9086441,R01NS086085,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'disability', 'dynamic system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,554411,0.02728664956479218
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9131824,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2016,492125,0.0358018449373213
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9113551,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,606065,0.04350347712073537
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of electrophysiological brain data is now ongoing a shift from measurement and visualization of individual channel signals (in the 'recording channel space') to visualizing and interpreting the data directly within a suitable inverse model representing activity reaching the electrodes by volume conduction from a set of effective data sources in native 'brain source space'. An equivalent shift, via the development and exploitation of an appropriate inverse imaging model, made possible the phenomenon of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the electrophysiological inverse problem is still difficult, dramatic progress has been and is being made through combined use of multimodal imaging and modern statistical signal processing methods. Recovering the considerable degree of spatial source resolution available in high-density scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological data, while retaining its natural advantage over other functional imaging methods in temporal resolution, has begun to yield a steady stream of new information about patterns of distributed brain processing supporting human behavior and experience. Relative to other brain imaging modalities, EEG has substantial and increasing cost and mobility advantages, making promotion of new EEG methods for source space analysis of increasing interest and importance for brain and health research. However, applying new source signal and signal processing models to electrophysiological data is complex and increasingly involves application of modern mathematical methods whose details are not within the training of most health research professionals. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University of California San Diego, began as a set of EEG data analysis running on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) released on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now, more than ten years later, the EEGLAB reference paper (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) has over 2,350 Google scholar citations (increasing at above 1 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links over 5,000 researchers, the news list over 9,000, and a recent survey of 687 researcher respondents reports EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis worldwide. EEGLAB is thus now a de facto standard supporting a wide range of EEG and other electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs. At least 35 EEGLAB plug-in toolsets have now been released by researchers from many laboratories. Under NIH PAR 11-028 we propose renewal funding to further develop and maintain the EEGLAB software framework. We propose new and better tools for brain source and source network modeling and localization, an expanded online EEGLAB course and workshop, better statistical inference modeling of group data, and new support for automated source decomposition, measure computation, data duration, and data sharing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data is now accelerating from measuring and visualizing individual scalp channel signals to directly visualizing and interpreting their brain sources. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University Of California San Diego (UCSD), supports a large number of EEG and related electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs.

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,9067148,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature neonates', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,642962,0.0656623249749606
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity        ",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9108126,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,190342,0.02465500164066308
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9185800,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'web portal', 'white matter change']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,400000,0.03283266568783613
"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition.

"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop and validate a novel head tracking system capable of compensating for patient motion during high-resolution brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. This device will lower improve the quality, comfort, and quantification of brain PET in patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well as drug abuse.

"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.            ",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,8814543,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,477101,0.005608890091182621
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders. Identifying coherent subpopulations within the spectrum of pathological changes would further our understanding of disease etiology, and identify subconditions that require alternative or modified interventions.",CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION,8921268,R01MH104414,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Africa', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'thalamocortical tract', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,496630,0.048032996355474714
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.                ",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8887443,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,339124,0.02294148011852247
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8935820,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,146944,0.020210212443756106
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.            ","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9064398,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Part', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'information organization', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,621558,-0.027053767809893537
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables. Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging.

"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.          ",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9029452,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2015,507375,0.0358018449373213
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction. Although fMRI studies of brain function have primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of perceptual or cognitive tasks, there is growing consensus that cognitive functions emerge as a result of dynamic context-dependent interactions between multiple brain areas. Developing new computational methods for investigating causal interactions in fMRI data has therefore taken added significance; the overall goal of this proposal is to address this critical need by developing new methods for studying causal interactions and brain connectivity between distributed brain regions during cognition.",Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction,8866489,R01NS086085,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'computerized tools', 'disability', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,507610,0.02728664956479218
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of electrophysiological brain data is now ongoing a shift from measurement and visualization of individual channel signals (in the 'recording channel space') to visualizing and interpreting the data directly within a suitable inverse model representing activity reaching the electrodes by volume conduction from a set of effective data sources in native 'brain source space'. An equivalent shift, via the development and exploitation of an appropriate inverse imaging model, made possible the phenomenon of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the electrophysiological inverse problem is still difficult, dramatic progress has been and is being made through combined use of multimodal imaging and modern statistical signal processing methods. Recovering the considerable degree of spatial source resolution available in high-density scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological data, while retaining its natural advantage over other functional imaging methods in temporal resolution, has begun to yield a steady stream of new information about patterns of distributed brain processing supporting human behavior and experience. Relative to other brain imaging modalities, EEG has substantial and increasing cost and mobility advantages, making promotion of new EEG methods for source space analysis of increasing interest and importance for brain and health research. However, applying new source signal and signal processing models to electrophysiological data is complex and increasingly involves application of modern mathematical methods whose details are not within the training of most health research professionals. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University of California San Diego, began as a set of EEG data analysis running on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) released on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now, more than ten years later, the EEGLAB reference paper (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) has over 2,350 Google scholar citations (increasing at above 1 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links over 5,000 researchers, the news list over 9,000, and a recent survey of 687 researcher respondents reports EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis worldwide. EEGLAB is thus now a de facto standard supporting a wide range of EEG and other electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs. At least 35 EEGLAB plug-in toolsets have now been released by researchers from many laboratories. Under NIH PAR 11-028 we propose renewal funding to further develop and maintain the EEGLAB software framework. We propose new and better tools for brain source and source network modeling and localization, an expanded online EEGLAB course and workshop, better statistical inference modeling of group data, and new support for automated source decomposition, measure computation, data duration, and data sharing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data is now accelerating from measuring and visualizing individual scalp channel signals to directly visualizing and interpreting their brain sources. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University Of California San Diego (UCSD), supports a large number of EEG and related electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs.

"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.            ",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,8926075,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,643700,0.04350347712073537
"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC). The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.",FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION,8880280,K23MH098176,"['6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethical Issues', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nursery Schools', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Seeds', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'case control', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'developmental neurobiology', 'early childhood', 'early experience', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'programs', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,131037,0.00041612108016372547
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8856234,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,614823,0.0656623249749606
"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging. The goal of this project is to develop a new software platform for automated aggregation, synthesis, and sharing of published neuroimaging results, with the potential to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mental health disorders.",Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data,8894083,R01MH096906,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'frontier', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'theories', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2015,547000,0.022279107552334247
"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop and validate a novel head tracking system capable of compensating for patient motion during high-resolution brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. This device will lower improve the quality, comfort, and quantification of brain PET in patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well as drug abuse.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8692440,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,227375,-0.018432702958145735

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders. Identifying coherent subpopulations within the spectrum of pathological changes would further our understanding of disease etiology, and identify subconditions that require alternative or modified interventions.                ",CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION,8757373,R01MH104414,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Africa', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'thalamocortical tract', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,488401,0.048032996355474714
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.            ",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8830000,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,151804,0.020210212443756106
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC). Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.  PROJECT NARRATIVE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.",Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level,8681538,R00MH094409,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'theories', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R00,2014,232967,-0.002996210941525476
"Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain integrity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging brain suffers from progressive brain tissue loss, putting hundreds of millions of us at risk for memory loss and dementia with no known cure. We recently discovered, in studies related to physical activity, growth factors, and homocysteine, several new leads about what may promote brain integrity. These variables interact with each other, with inflammation, and with brain structure and disease risk in complex and striking ways. To resist the looming epidemic of degenerative disease, we must determine how such variables deter brain decline. We will map, with unprecedented sensitivity, how these vital processes, which are targetable with interventions, relate to brain structure. We also combine brain measures to predict, with machine learning who will imminently decline. We relate brain and cognitive decline in 3 populations to (1) an inflammatory marker and related neurodegenerative risk genes, (2) growth factor and homocysteine levels, and (3) physical exercise. We will discover how these variables interact to promote or deter brain disease, in our regions of interest (ROIs) - the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and cingulate gyrus. This work is crucial to combat diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SZ), among others that are both related to these variables and marked by deficits in these ROIs. We will also survey the whole brain with novel brain mapping methods. Physical activity promotes human brain regeneration in these regions, in part through its effects on growth factors. It decreases inflammation and homocysteine levels, both of which relate to hippocampal integrity. Our project will boost power in clinical trials by identifying targetable disease-driving mechanisms. Building on our recent discoveries, we use (1) genotyped variants in inflammation-related genes, (2) a controllable ""environmental"" variable (exercise), and (3) peripheral measures related to inflammation, neurogenesis, and homocysteine to assess integrity of the hippocampus, PFC, and cingulate gyrus, and their progressive decline. We examine three populations already scanned with MRI: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (566 AD, MCI, and normal elderly subjects), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 517 AD, MCI, and control subjects; of whom 85 have our targeted serum measures), and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, composed of younger adults from families with autosomal dominant AD mutations (DIAN; ~400: ~20% with AD; ~50% mutation carriers). We will assess: 3/4 how candidate gene variants associated with AD and inflammation (see Approach) relate to a serum marker of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor alpha;TNFα), and to hippocampal volume. 3/4 how serum levels of growth factors and homocysteine relate to hippocampal, PFC, and cingulate volume. 3/4 how exercise levels affect hippocampal volume; how growth factors and TNFα modulate this relationship. 3/4 how baseline serum levels of growth factors, TNFα, and homocysteine, polymorphisms in related genes, and exercise together predict brain and cognitive changes over a 2-year follow-up period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project will have major impact on public health by discovering how three key processes (inflammation, brain growth factors, and exercise) relate to brain structure and brain decline over a 2-year period. Physical exercise boosts the ability of growth factors to promote regeneration in the hippocampus, which is important in memory; inflammation (which has many causes, including disease) decreases that ability. Our last 20 years of work revealed how Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and drug abuse involve hippocampal deficits and brain atrophy. Here we will evaluate in three large populations how growth factors, inflammation, and exercise work together to protect or harm the human brain - identifying promising directions for treatment, prevention, and a mechanistic understanding of diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.","Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain integrity",8696676,RF1AG041915,"['Aerobic', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amino Acids', 'Atrophic', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Encephalitis', 'Epidemic', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth Factor Gene', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Growth', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Width', 'Work', 'adult neurogenesis', 'aging brain', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'brain-derived growth factor', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cingulate gyrus', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'combat', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'immune function', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'mutation carrier', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenesis', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotropic', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,RF1,2014,2938975,-0.0324268870416223
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology and has the potential to be applied to analyze a wide range of scientific problems beyond brain imaging data analysis.                ",Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience,8611397,R01MH102339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'web services']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,378911,0.05738209382031656
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction. Although fMRI studies of brain function have primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of perceptual or cognitive tasks, there is growing consensus that cognitive functions emerge as a result of dynamic context-dependent interactions between multiple brain areas.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.        Program Director (Last, first, middle): Kleinfeld, David, Kaufhold, John and Squier, Jeffrey. These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain. We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments. The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine: One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma. The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.",Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses,8729873,R01EB003832,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Beds', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laminectomy', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Ursidae Family', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arteriole', 'base', 'bone', 'brain cell', 'capillary', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'second harmonic', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,812810,0.024244588138604414
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of electrophysiological brain data is now ongoing a shift from measurement and visualization of individual channel signals (in the 'recording channel space') to visualizing and interpreting the data directly within a suitable inverse model representing activity reaching the electrodes by volume conduction from a set of effective data sources in native 'brain source space'. An equivalent shift, via the development and exploitation of an appropriate inverse imaging model, made possible the phenomenon of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the electrophysiological inverse problem is still difficult, dramatic progress has been and is being made through combined use of multimodal imaging and modern statistical signal processing methods. Recovering the considerable degree of spatial source resolution available in high-density scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological data, while retaining its natural advantage over other functional imaging methods in temporal resolution, has begun to yield a steady stream of new information about patterns of distributed brain processing supporting human behavior and experience. Relative to other brain imaging modalities, EEG has substantial and increasing cost and mobility advantages, making promotion of new EEG methods for source space analysis of increasing interest and importance for brain and health research. However, applying new source signal and signal processing models to electrophysiological data is complex and increasingly involves application of modern mathematical methods whose details are not within the training of most health research professionals. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University of California San Diego, began as a set of EEG data analysis running on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) released on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now, more than ten years later, the EEGLAB reference paper (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) has over 2,350 Google scholar citations (increasing at above 1 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links over 5,000 researchers, the news list over 9,000, and a recent survey of 687 researcher respondents reports EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis worldwide. EEGLAB is thus now a de facto standard supporting a wide range of EEG and other electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs. At least 35 EEGLAB plug-in toolsets have now been released by researchers from many laboratories. Under NIH PAR 11-028 we propose renewal funding to further develop and maintain the EEGLAB software framework. We propose new and better tools for brain source and source network modeling and localization, an expanded online EEGLAB course and workshop, better statistical inference modeling of group data, and new support for automated source decomposition, measure computation, data duration, and data sharing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data is now accelerating from measuring and visualizing individual scalp channel signals to directly visualizing and interpreting their brain sources. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University Of California San Diego (UCSD), supports a large number of EEG and related electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!          The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue.

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8688242,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,602789,0.0656623249749606
"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.          Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging. The goal of this project is to develop a new software platform for automated aggregation, synthesis, and sharing of published neuroimaging results, with the potential to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mental health disorders.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter integrity based on genetic profiles, we hope to pave the way to personalized prevention and management of brain disorders.",Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning,8448904,F30AG041681,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Back', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'response', 'time interval', 'treatment response', 'white matter', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2013,47232,0.0035163251000643377
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8532012,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,227049,-0.018432702958145735
"Brain Science Computer Cluster     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational requirements of contemporary brain science research often exceed financial and resource management limits of individual investigator laboratories. Many contemporary neuroscience research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high-speed storage devices. A limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a readily accessible high-speed computational resource. A central computational resource based on a unified cluster of contemporary Linux CPUs and GPUs will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access common to stand-alone workstations. The requested computer cluster has system software that automatically balances CPU and GPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off-loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets. This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists. The system can be readily expansion as needs, either computational, storage, or new users, arise. Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost. The flexible nature of the system will serve a variety of research needs of the Brown brain science community. The computational resource is expected to bring together researchers at Brown working on the common problem of neural processing.             n/a",Brain Science Computer Cluster,8447697,S10OD016366,"['Architecture', 'Brain', 'Client', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'base', 'computer cluster', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'novel', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems']",OD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,S10,2013,599598,0.014940744079916043
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification.

"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of electrophysiological brain data is now ongoing a shift from measurement and visualization of individual channel signals (in the 'recording channel space') to visualizing and interpreting the data directly within a suitable inverse model representing activity reaching the electrodes by volume conduction from a set of effective data sources in native 'brain source space'. An equivalent shift, via the development and exploitation of an appropriate inverse imaging model, made possible the phenomenon of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the electrophysiological inverse problem is still difficult, dramatic progress has been and is being made through combined use of multimodal imaging and modern statistical signal processing methods. Recovering the considerable degree of spatial source resolution available in high-density scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological data, while retaining its natural advantage over other functional imaging methods in temporal resolution, has begun to yield a steady stream of new information about patterns of distributed brain processing supporting human behavior and experience. Relative to other brain imaging modalities, EEG has substantial and increasing cost and mobility advantages, making promotion of new EEG methods for source space analysis of increasing interest and importance for brain and health research. However, applying new source signal and signal processing models to electrophysiological data is complex and increasingly involves application of modern mathematical methods whose details are not within the training of most health research professionals. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University of California San Diego, began as a set of EEG data analysis running on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) released on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now, more than ten years later, the EEGLAB reference paper (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) has over 2,350 Google scholar citations (increasing at above 1 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links over 5,000 researchers, the news list over 9,000, and a recent survey of 687 researcher respondents reports EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis worldwide. EEGLAB is thus now a de facto standard supporting a wide range of EEG and other electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs. At least 35 EEGLAB plug-in toolsets have now been released by researchers from many laboratories. Under NIH PAR 11-028 we propose renewal funding to further develop and maintain the EEGLAB software framework. We propose new and better tools for brain source and source network modeling and localization, an expanded online EEGLAB course and workshop, better statistical inference modeling of group data, and new support for automated source decomposition, measure computation, data duration, and data sharing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data is now accelerating from measuring and visualizing individual scalp channel signals to directly visualizing and interpreting their brain sources. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at the University Of California San Diego (UCSD), supports a large number of EEG and related electrophysiological research studies and teaching labs.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!          The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8509448,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,650062,0.0656623249749606
"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.          Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging. The goal of this project is to develop a new software platform for automated aggregation, synthesis, and sharing of published neuroimaging results, with the potential to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mental health disorders.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli?

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.        Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. With the development of appropriate analytical tools, multimodal functional brain imaging is in the process of revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, dementia, and epilepsy that affect tens of millions of Americans.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG  Project Summary/Abstract Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.  Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.",Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG,8288263,R33DA026109,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug user', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Four-dimensional', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methamphetamine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Proxy', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'base', 'blind', 'chronic pain', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'craving', 'data space', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'human subject', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'machine abstracting', 'method development', 'mind control', 'neurofeedback', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R33,2012,566794,0.047167747379861825
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.

"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,8136044,R01NS062885,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Build-it', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'DLG1 gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalitis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamate Metabolism Pathway', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myelin', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neuronal Injury', 'North America', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Western Europe', 'axonal degeneration', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time interval', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,354969,0.025513406721889054
"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7942859,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2011,19755,0.05372828985923508
"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.

The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,7929626,R01NS062885,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Build-it', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'DLG1 gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalitis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamate Metabolism Pathway', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myelin', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neuronal Injury', 'North America', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Western Europe', 'axonal degeneration', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time interval', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,146808,0.025513406721889054
"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7765534,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,324963,0.01312257794799279

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest.

"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7751495,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nutmeg - dietary', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2009,46257,0.05372828985923508
"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7583948,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,328593,0.01312257794799279
"Massively Parallel Brain Imaging  I propose a disruptive technology that will revolutionize our understanding of brain function, development, and disease. Because the study of neural circuits remains deeply limited by a paucity of data, we need massively parallel approaches to brain imaging that will raise data acquisition rates by over two orders of magnitude. High-throughput technologies have already revolutionized certain areas of biology such as genomics and proteomics, but neuroscience has yet to experience a growth spurt of comparable magnitude. I will construct instrumentation allowing the brain volumes of ~100 alert flies to be imaged simultaneously by two-photon fluorescence microscopy. I have chosen the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, because of its small brain, its sophisticated behavioral repertoire, the large number of strains with genetically targeted alterations to brain circuitry, the utility of fluorescence imaging of neural activity in this species, and the importance of the fly as a model for the study of many brain diseases.  Massively parallel brain imaging will open entirely new avenues: 1) The ability to track neural dynamics across the brains of large numbers of normal flies and those with genetically induced neural circuit perturbations will revolutionize our understanding of how neural circuits produce animal behavior; 2) The now prominent role of the fruit fly as a model system for the study of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and addiction implies we will gain significant medical insights into devastating conditions; 3) Our technology will have important applications to drug screening, allowing the cellular effects of new compounds to be assessed rapidly in vivo; 4) The ability to perform high-throughput time-lapse imaging of cellular events during the maturation of fly embryos will allow an additional revolution in developmental neurobiology. Applications of our technology will also be plentiful in other model organisms such as nematodes and zebrafish, profoundly impacting multiple areas of biomedicine. n/a",Massively Parallel Brain Imaging,7683010,DP1OD003560,"['Ablation', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caliber', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Cornea', 'Crack Cocaine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dendrites', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fiber Optics', 'Figs - dietary', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Invertebrates', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Larva', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lobe', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleotides', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Sapphire', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synchrotrons', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tea', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tube', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virion', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'addiction', 'age related', 'base', 'behavioral sensitization', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cocaine exposure', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug discovery', 'essays', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'light microscopy', 'light scattering', 'meetings', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'mouse genome', 'mutant', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurogenetics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'object motion', 'optical imaging', 'optical traps', 'practical application', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'structural biology', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP1,2009,395000,0.00667015913921024

"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7325760,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2008,65055,0.024027769151720266

"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7350139,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Condition', 'Count', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,322249,0.01312257794799279
"SVM based group data analysis for drug abuse disorder ASL perfusion study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI provides a potentially extremely useful tool for drug abuse/addiction studies due to the noninvasive cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement and immunity to low frequency MR signal drift effects that degrade functional MRI based on BOLD contrast over time. However, data processing through conventional univariate general linear model (GLM) based methods has proved extremely challenging for ASL data due to its intrinsic low SNR, the increased motion and agitation typically present during drug craving states, and the ""patchy flow"" defects commonly found in the brains of patients with certain types of chronic substance abuse (e.g., cocaine). Assuming a linear brain response to the functional stimuli and ignoring the abundant spatial brain activity coupling, the standard GLM is initially sub-optimal for fMRI data analysis. Modeling each voxel's time series with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), it may be further ill-posed to drug abuse studies since the actual shape of HRF may differ significantly in the addicted patient's brain from the canonical one and may differ significantly from patient to patient, from voxel to voxel. A more powerful data analysis method is fundamentally demanded for drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion studies. The goal of this project is to develop a multivariate and brain response modeling-free fMRI data processing method and to use it for revealing the drug craving related brain activation patterns within existing drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion fMRI data in our center. A machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), will be used to extract a spatial discriminance map between different experimental conditions for each subject, and a statistic framework will be provided to give a population inference about the extracted discriminance (Aim 1). We hypothesize that this machine-learning based data processing will increase the detection sensitivity of ASL perfusion fMRI as compared to the conventional GLM approach because of the data driven nature and multivariate processing of SVM. To verify this hypothesis and to validate the sensitivity, specificity and reliability of the proposed methods, we propose to acquire 40 normal controls' null-hypothesis ASL perfusion fMRI data and sensory-motor task data in Aim 2. The last but the most important aim (Aim 3) is to apply the proposed method to analyze the existing drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion fMRI data in our center. In addition to the basic science implications for ASL perfusion fMRI and BOLD fMRI, we believe this line of work will provide critical information, e.g., more precise diagnostic measurement, and prediction of treatment or medication response for the current cocaine and nicotine addiction/relapse vulnerability studies. The output of these more powerful ASL data analysis methods will also pave the way for general application of ASL perfusion fMRI methods across multiple brain disorders, and for sustained states within the normal brain.          n/a",SVM based group data analysis for drug abuse disorder ASL perfusion study,7385333,R03DA023496,"['Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronic', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spin Labels', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stimulus', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'computerized data processing', 'craving', 'drug craving', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'nicotine craving', 'response', 'size', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2007,236250,0.008907343222790888
"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

"Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a need for a non-invasive and continuous bedside monitor for brain oxygenation for adult human patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optically based technique that could meet such demand.  However, NIRS instruments have yet to achieve their initially expected potential of becoming routine clinical monitors complementary to pulse oximetry. One major challenge is to develop an optical transducer probe and a corresponding algorithm to solve the problem of interference from extracerebral tissue (skin, scalp, and skull) in adult NIRS applications. Another major challenge is to develop an algorithm that will be able to absolutely quantify the optical signals to derive quantitative variables or indices that are of clinical significance. Our goal is to resolve these challenges to develop an NIRS monitor that will determine absolute brain hemoglobin oxygen saturation on adult patients.  The primary objectives of this SBIR proposal are: 1) Design and construct an NIRS monitor for use on adult human patients; 2) Determine the optimum adult NIRS probe configuration to minimize extracerebral interference 3) Evaluate and validate novel adult NIRS algorithms that further minimize extracerebral interference and determine absolute brain oxygen saturation.         n/a",Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor,6585412,R43NS045488,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain circulation', ' infrared spectrometry', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' optics', ' oxygen transport', ' patient monitoring device', ' respiratory oxygenation', ' swine']",NINDS,"CAS MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2003,100000,-0.018952352835787036

"STATISTICAL TOOLS--BIOELECTROMAGNETIC SOURCE ESTIMATION Functional imaging techniques are important to brain researchers and clinicians alike because many phenomena cannot be observed by anatomical techniques alone. Among functional imaging methods, only magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG, EEG, or jointly M/EEG) can noninvasively resolve events with a millisecond time scale. Statistical tools for M/BEG functional brain imaging software will be developed to estimate and visualize the spatial extent and time course of brain activity. Algorithms will be developed for the incorporation of a priori information into source estimation, and for estimating the uncertainty of the estimates. These tools will permit the use of information derived from anatomy, physiology, and other functional imaging modalities (such as fMR1 and PET) to be combined with M/EEG data to improve the robustness, reliability, and objectivity of the M/EEG analysis. The algorithms will be incorporated into prototype software, and the software validated with both simulated and experimental data. The software will comprise a PC/Windows-based program suite for analysis and display. The algorithms and resulting software may be used to study both normal brain function, such as measurements in cognitive neuroscience which may be studied with evoked response/event related potentials or spontaneous EEG, and in diseases of the brain, such as the epilepsies, where precise spatial and temporal resolution may be of value for diagnosis and presurgical evaluation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The techniques which we propose are a non-invasive, non-radiological and relatively low cost addition to existing EEG, MEG and MRI systems, and provides information which is not currently available from these systems independently.

"Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction Abstract  One of the high priority research areas listed in the BRAIN 2025 Report is a better understanding of the brain network dynamics across time and space from human electrophysiological recordings. The RFA-MH-20- 120 “BRAIN Initiative: Secondary Analysis and Archiving of BRAIN Initiative Data” specifically focuses on the use of large volumes of existing data stored in open access public databases. In the proposed studies, we will perform an innovative secondary analysis of existing intracranial EEG records from patients with medicine- resistant epilepsy collected during their presurgical evaluation. These records from public repositories would allow us to study dynamic interactions between hippocampal and neocortical structures during the development of pathological activity as well as during verbal memory tasks. We will use a novel and rapidly developing approach from the realm of machine learning algorithms namely, deep learning neural networks. Physiological mechanisms of memory formation and consolidation as well as pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy are poorly understood. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that physiological function and dysfunction of the hippocampal-neocortical system may have a common mechanism that depends on the dynamic interaction of electrophysiological oscillations in the system. Brain oscillations have been suggested to be involved in information transfer within and between brain networks by modulating neural excitability at different spatial and temporal scales. The interaction of oscillations across different time scales is referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ and it represents a high-order structure in the functional organization of brain rhythms. Aberrant patterns of cross-frequency coupling may lead to memory dysfunction as well as facilitate the propagation of pathological activity. At present, the field does not have a mechanistically justified criterion to distinguish between physiological and pathological oscillations especially regarding their high-order interactions. We will study cross- frequency coupling during the interictal-ictal transition (Aim 1) and during successful and unsuccessful verbal memory performance (Aim 2) using Deep Learning algorithms. One of the study goals is to create a neural network capable of recognizing patterns of cross-frequency coupling as biomarkers of different physiological and pathological functional states of the brain. A comprehensive characterization of cross-frequency coupling would allow us to distinguish between physiological and aberrant forms of interaction between brain networks at different time scales. The study results will deepen our knowledge about the functional organization of brain rhythms and will provide a new method to recognize functional states from electrophysiological records of brain activity. This method will be applicable for a more accurate monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of memory impairments in neurological and mental disorders as well as for the development of new tools for seizure prediction and control. Public Health Relevance Statement  A better understanding of brain dynamics from human electrophysiological recordings will help us find new ways to treat neurological and mental disorders and the BRAIN Initiative encourages the secondary analysis of large amounts of existing data. The proposed study will analyze intracranial EEG records from human participants stored in public data repositories using artificial intelligence methods. The results will deepen our knowledge of brain function and dysfunction and will pave the way for the development of new methods to diagnose and treat brain disorders.",Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction,10008042,RF1MH123192,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neocortex', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Training', 'cognitive process', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'mind control', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'public repository', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,839700,0.032739698989329935
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9977173,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,438169,0.012909549749411156
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9999673,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395331,0.030242877790419186
"Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data Project Summary The broad objective of this research is to develop a powerful deep-learning based multiple testing approach for high-dimensional spatial data that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies, in particular, brain imaging studies. The motivating problem is to detect the cerebral metabolic abnormalities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data. Existing multiple testing approaches in solving this problem often ignore or inadequately capture the spatial dependence among the test statistics obtained from brain voxels and thus lose substantial power for the detection. We will develop a novel spatial multiple testing method that utilizes the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), a key deep- learning technique, to well capture the spatial dependence among test statistics and thus to achieve the optimal power in the sense of minimizing the false nondiscovery rate (FNR) while correctly controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given level. The proposed DCNN-based FDR controlling method has enhanced power to discover new AD-related brain regions that are missed by conventional methods, thereby leading to novel clinical and pathological studies. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1. To develop an optimal spatial FDR controlling approach by connecting the unsupervised local-significance-index based multiple testing with the supervised DCNN-based image segmentation; 2. To evaluate the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach via extensive simulations under various three-dimensional spatial dependence structures, in comparison with multiple classical and state-of-the-art methods; 3. To apply proposed spatial FDR controlling approach to detect AD-related brain regions using the FDG-PET datasets from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Weill Cornell Brain Health Imaging Institute; 4. To develop a user- friendly and publicly available software package with versions in both Python and R to implement the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach. The proposed DCNN-based approach will also be widely applicable to large- scale multiple testing problems in other fields of biomedical research that involve spatial dependence. Project Narrative This project will exploit recent advances in deep learning to efficiently solve the large-scale spatial multiple testing problems that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies. The proposed powerful deep-learning based spatial multiple testing approach will be particularly useful in brain imaging studies on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive impairment.",Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data,10107565,R21AG070303,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Architecture', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Fluorine', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Group', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain health', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'metabolic rate', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'repository', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,435875,-0.011724885023960335
"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10058463,R01DA040487,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'life-long learning', 'negative affect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'repository', 'scale up', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,627034,0.009146165014188612
"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Problem', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'success']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,297504,-0.014442038410195333
"Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience Two major recent advances have raised the possibility of fundamental breakthroughs in both basic and clinical neuroscience: the development of new tools to probe the nervous system with single-cell resolution as well as brain-wide scope, and breakthroughs in machine learning methods for handling complex data. Yet there remain crucial barriers to progress: while data acquisition tools are now broadly within the grasp of neuroscience researchers, the same cannot be said about data analytical tools that can tackle the complexities of the new data sets being gathered. In addition, the highly training-data dependent, black-box Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods that have shown rapid growth in the technological domain, are not well-suited to scientific data analysis, where transparency and understanding is more important than black-box performance measures. This proposal brings together a cross-disciplinary team of leading neuroscience and computer science researchers to develop and deploy a critical set of data analytical tools for the neuroscience community. The tools will be useful for data already gathered in major group efforts in the US Brain Initiative, and also for new data sets being acquired using the tools developed in the Initiative.  Extraction of the projection morphologies of individual neurons, and the classification and analysis of neuronal cell types is a central goal of the Brain Initiative. Because data from various sources are often analyzed with custom algorithms, scaling up existing approaches for use across large datasets and multiple data types has been a challenge. Instead researchers need a comprehensive, flexible mathematical framework that can be applied to a wide variety of data, including both static and dynamic measures. We propose to achieve this goal by combining Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods with Deep Net based machine learning methods. Such a combined approach retains the flexibility of data-driven ANN methods while at the same time brings in conceptually well-grounded methods from TDA that are still able to address the complexities of brain-wide data sets with single-cell resolution. Aim 1 of the proposal will use these methods to automate tasks in neuroanatomy previously requiring intensive human expert effort. Aim 2 will apply the methods to single cell omics data sets. Aim 3 will deploy the tools developed to the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network and the neuroscience community. Recent years have seen many advances in experimental tools for probing brains in unprecedented ways, with single cell resolution, and as a result both individual investigators and large consortia are generating brain-wide single-cell data at an unprecedented scale. To derive full benefit from these data sets, researchers need theoretical and computational tools to analyze, visualize and derive knowledge from the data. In the proposed work, theoretically principled tools from Topological Data Analysis, in particular Discrete Morse Theory, are combined with artificial neural networks for Machine Learning, to provide a computational and analytical framework to deal with the complexity of the large-scale, high-dimensional data sets and derive the full benefits for basic as well as clinical neuroscience research.",Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience,10123310,RF1MH125317,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Performance', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Skeleton', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'data centers', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'high dimensionality', 'informatics tool', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data types', 'neuronal cell body', 'rapid growth', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,RF1,2020,2048230,-0.0004604056144035124
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9942528,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,559900,-0.0284012932265298
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,9991669,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37706,0.06044178339594355
"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative.

"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit). However, interactions occur across scales and may account for much of the variability observed in the brain. This proposal will develop a framework for integrating data from different scales using machine learning tools. The results will improve our understanding of how the brain functions and serve as a foundation for modeling neuromodulatory treatments for brain disorders.",Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity,10007011,R01EB029857,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'brain research', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'long short term memory', 'long short term memory network', 'millisecond', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'optical imaging', 'predicting response', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1124452,0.021510914298227355
"Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI Project Summary/Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool both clinically and in scientific research, with broad applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to presurgical planning. FMRI can generate whole brain neuronal activation maps, yet it is an inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) method due to the relatively small changes in activation signal relative to the baseline signal. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate robust, high SNR fMRI by using a novel acquisition method, oscillating steady state (OSS) fMRI, along with machine learning (ML) techniques, to reconstruct high-quality images of the OSS fMRI data. OSS fMRI can increase SNR by >2x compared to the current state-of-the-art in fMRI acquisition methods, and this boost is roughly equivalent to the SNR gain going from a 3T MRI scanner to a 7T MRI scanner. The SNR increase is a direct result of the steady state approach. However, with a more complex, oscillating acquisition, OSS fMRI can be more susceptible to common MRI artifacts than traditional methods if left uncorrected. Two of the most common sources of MRI artifacts are changes in the main magnetic field (B0) due to physiological noise (such as respiration) and patient motion. This project will develop robust, high SNR fMRI at 3T by incorporating the effects of (1) B0 changes and (2) patient motion into the OSS signal model and image reconstruction algorithms. A new image reconstruction that incorporates neural networks will correct for B0 fluctuations and remove B0 induced artifacts. We will train a neural network to generate B0 field maps using data from a conventional, physics-based two echo field mapping technique to implicitly incorporate prior information of the physics into the reconstruction, while also providing a fast, ML-based field mapping method. To correct for subject motion, we will develop a neural network that estimates rigid-body motion parameters from sequential image frames in the fMRI scan. These motion parameters will be used in an iterative image reconstruction to produce high-quality resting-state and task-based fMRI, even in the presence of subject motion. The technology developed in this proposal will result in improved functional MRI that has the potential to significantly advance both the study of the human brain and the treatment of neurological disorders. The University of Michigan is one of the top research universities in the US, and provides an ideal environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed research strategy. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UM have all the necessary hardware and computational resources needed for this project, including two state-of-the-art GE 3T MRI scanners and extensive GPU hardware for the machine learning components of the project. Furthermore, Drs. Jeffrey Fessler and Douglas Noll have proven expertise in fMRI image acquisition and reconstruction, as well as extensive mentorship experience, that will help guide this project and my training. Project Narrative Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure brain function, and it has revolutionized our understanding of cognitive processes during the last 25 years and has also been used as a tool for presurgical mapping of language and other sensitive brain regions. More recently, fMRI is being used as a biomarker for the progression of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depression. In this project we will improve fMRI techniques by developing new methods that are more robust to common sources of MRI image degradation, which will improve the sharpness of the fMRI images without increasing instrumentation costs.","Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI",10067072,F32EB029289,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Left', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic Process', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'magnetic field', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'progression marker', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2020,64926,0.01389438304154958
"Open-source software for multi-scale mapping of the human brain Project Summary (maximum 30 lines) The BRAIN initiative seeks to develop and apply technologies in order to understand of how brain cells interact in both time and space to give rise to brain function. A key deliverable in BRAIN is a systematic census of neuronal and glial cell types, which is a prerequisite to understand how these cells interact and change in healthy aging and in disease. Moreover, such a census will provide a common reference cell taxonomy, which is crucial to harmonize studies at different sites and achieve the goals of BRAIN.  A necessary companion of the census is a reference coordinate system, which enables us to understand the spatio-anatomical context in which cells interact, as well as their connectivity. Building such a coordinate system requires advanced spatial alignment (registration) tools, since virtually every lab technique used in microscopic brain cell phenotyping – particularly in human brain – requires blocking and/or sectioning of samples, hence distorting the structure of tissue. Due to the difficulty of providing support for datasets and acquisition setups different to the original, most publicly available techniques to recover the lost tissue structure (“3D reconstruction”) rely on very simple techniques, such as vanilla pairwise registration of neighboring sections. Moreover, conventional reconstruction methods are notoriously slow, and no available method is designed to 3D reconstruct whole human brains.  In this interdisciplinary project, which lies at the nexus of computer science, MRI physics, histology, optical imaging, anatomy and statistics, we propose to extend, robustify, test, distribute and support our recently developed, state-or-the-art techniques that will enable the constructions of a coordinate system capable of representing multi-scale maps of human brain anatomy and function. This includes algorithms and software for: image analysis of ex vivo MRI; construction of laminar models of the human cerebral cortex; 3D reconstruction of microscopic images and alignment to the laminar models; surface based analysis of microscopy data on the laminar structure; and alignment of ex vivo and in vivo images to accurately transfer information from microscopy to MRI studies of the living brain, in health and in disease.  The tools we propose to build and disseminate will combine modern deep learning techniques with principled Bayesian inference, and have the potential to deliver accurate registration at the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic level, with high throughput delivered using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Effective dissemination of these tools, along with companion test data, will be achieved through our widespread package FreeSurfer. The distributed tools will not only enable the construction of a cell census with rich spatial information at human brain scale (including a novel laminar model), but will also have a tremendous impact in other areas of neuroimaging, including overarching goals of BRAIN such as: linking cellular-level activity to functional MRI, atlas building, or connecting axonal anatomy to diffusion MRI. Project narrative (maximum 3 sentences) In this project, we seek resources to develop, integrate, distribute and support a set of tools for the automated spatial mapping of in vivo (MRI, PET, etc…) and ex vivo (microscopy) imaging modalities, which can be used to enhance the BRAIN cell census with a coordinate system for representing maps of human brain function and anatomy at multiple scales – including laminar models of the cerebral cortex that have been long desired by the neuroimaging community. The tools will include algorithms for segmentation of ex vivo MRI; laminar modeling; registration of microscopic images to MRI; and analysis of histological data on spherical coordinate systems of the cortex. These tools will not only enable the scientific community to include spatial information into the cell census, but will also have a dramatic impact on other neuroimaging projects related to the BRAIN initiative in terms of their ability to share and compare data in a unified coordinate system and use the results of BRAIN research to make inferences in studies of living human beings.",Open-source software for multi-scale mapping of the human brain,10008355,RF1MH123195,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genus Vanilla', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Iron', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'contrast imaging', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'sample fixation', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,RF1,2020,558806,0.041172728406016754
"Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers There is an increasing need for efficient and robust software to process, integrate, and offer insight across the diversity of population imaging efforts underway across the BRAIN Initiative and other projects. Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages.

"Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations PROJECT SUMMARY Network analysis of brain connectivity, or Connectomics, has emerged as an important interdisciplinary field, making strides in advancing both fundamental scientific knowledge on the structure of the brain, as well as providing insights into the pathology of neurological disorders. Advances in neuroimaging technologies have enabled acquisition of high-resolution datasets on brain activities in normal and diseased populations, while advanced machine learning methods hold promise to obtain data-driven insights into the functional architecture of the brain. Functional connectivity analysis is typically carried out in two steps. First, one estimates a network among different brain regions by studying strengths of associations among the time course of neurophysiological signals for different subjects (patients or healthy controls). Next, one compares the networks between different groups of subjects and seeks network features prevalent in specific groups of interest using statistical methods. Two emerging challenges in this field are the presence of heterogeneity amongst subjects in large study cohorts, and developing predictive models to construct robust and interpretable results. The central goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing machine learning methods equipped with uncertainty quantification measures, suitable for high-dimensional network data for heterogeneous populations. Upon completion, these methods are expected to provide automated, robust and more accurate discovery of connectivity patterns that is prevalent in heterogeneous populations of patients. We aim to accomplish this goal by pursuing two specific aims: (1) develop estimation and inference methods for frequency domain measures of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks, (2) develop a framework of mixed effects model of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks that accounts for heterogeneity among subjects and enables discoveries more likely to generalize in large cohorts. For each aim, novel machine learning methods for integrative analysis of structural and functional connectivity will be developed using a mathematical model of network diffusion. We will also calibrate and validate our proposed methods on data from Human Connectome Project, and on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The proposed approach is innovative since it integrates machinery across diverse disciplines, including statistics, machine learning and network analysis to address important challenges learning large functional connectivity graphs. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have both scientific and translational impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding brain connectivity patterns using rigorous machine learning methods can help seek common patterns in large databases in an automated fashion, and can potentially lead to development of neuroimaging based diagnostic tools and sensitive prognostic measures. The proposed research will thus use fundamental scientific knowledge about brain to assist translational research in neurological disease.",Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations,10110789,R21NS120227,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cations', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Interest Group', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain size', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical model', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,428417,0.04767037271149452
"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical neurosciences.",Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative,10129715,R61NS120249,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral construct', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'data ingestion', 'data pipeline', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'multimodal data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'portability', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sharing platform', 'stroke recovery', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'working group']",NINDS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R61,2020,1015434,0.02515865837744425
"A decentralized macro and micro gene-by-environment interaction analysis of substance use behavior and its brain biomarkers   Abstract Wide-spread data sharing has started to permeate the brain imaging community from funders to researchers. However, in recent years there have also been some concerns raised regarding ethical issues related to privacy and data ownership among others. In the parent award we are leveraging and extending a privacy preserving decentralized data sharing platform called COINSTAC to perform a study of gene-by-environmental effects by pooling together data from across the world, some of which is unable to be openly shared. In this supplement we will study various bioethical issues related to different data sharing strategies. This will include calculating risk scores from existing data to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning to potentially reidentify from similar or different data types, a detailed survey of various policy makers and stakeholders including researchers, federal employees, IRB members, and more, and finally the development of a forward looking white paper addressing both privacy, policy, and regulatory aspects which attempts to frame the various aspects that arise in the contact of the spectrum of data sharing approaches including fully open, ‘trust’ based via data usage agreements, privacy preserving via tools like COINSTAC, and more. The outcomes of this supplement will provide a useful guide for the field going forward and also provide initial data necessary to develop a larger scale project on these topics going forward. Narrative The era of big data, open science, and deep learning is upon us, and data sharing can be done in various ways ranging from fully open to privacy preserving to fully closed. However bioethical issues related to risk, privacy, and data sharing strategies have not been well studied in the context of combined brain imaging, genomics, and macro-environmental data and can be especially sensitive in the context of information such as substance use. In this supplement we will quantify risk levels, survey a broad community of stakeholders, and develop recommendations for the field going forward.",A decentralized macro and micro gene-by-environment interaction analysis of substance use behavior and its brain biomarkers  ,10131528,R01DA049238,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Big Data', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Protection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Economic Burden', 'Employee', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic group', 'Europe', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Household', 'Image', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Privacy', 'Quality Control', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Urbanization', 'Visualization', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'drinking', 'early life stress', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic profiling', 'human subject', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'rural area', 'sex', 'sharing platform', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'urban area', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,149834,-0.047308551790904665
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9914136,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,540520,0.00850944159216387
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,9919645,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,465332,-0.008316766174192969
"Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo Project Summary Developing new methodological and analytical tools to address currently insurmountable experimental questions is crucial to the future of neuroscience. While recent advances in two-photon microscopy and activity sensors have revolutionized our understanding of the cellular and circuit basis of behavior, many barriers still exist that preclude fully exploring the molecular basis of these processes in vivo. This is an important question, as modulating synaptic strength is thought to underlie higher brain functions such as learning and memory, whereas synaptic degradation is observed in many neurological pathologies. Despite the clear significance of synaptic communication, a large-scale analysis of how synapses across the brain are distributed and change during learning has not been performed, mainly due to technical difficulties arising from the immensely complex nature of synaptic networks. Here, we present a suite of novel methodologies that breaks through these barriers. Our novel approach leverages CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins, in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize fluorescently tagged synapses in behaving animals, and deep-learning-based automatic synapse detection. Using these minimally invasive methods, we will be able to longitudinally track how the strength of millions of individual synapses change during learning. By developing and enabling new strategies to automatically detect and track vast numbers of synapses across entire brain regions, this pioneering approach has the potential to provide us with an unprecedented view of synapses in behaving animals, enabling new discoveries regarding how dynamic regulation of synaptic strength encodes learning and memory. Project Narrative This multi-disciplinary proposal leverages molecular labeling, machine learning, and in vivo microscopy to develop a suite of first-in-class tools to automatically detect synaptic plasticity in intact animals. By employing these novel tools we seek to explain how dynamic modulation of synaptic networks encodes learning and memory. Disruption of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be tightly associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases and the proposed research may reveal novel therapeutic approaches for several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease.",Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo,10009886,RF1MH123212,"['AMPA Receptors', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Investigation', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain volume', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'interest', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'open source', 'postsynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'synaptic function', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1757079,0.00011771092870208134
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9954159,R24MH114806,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Capital', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Software Design', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validity of Results', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'animal data', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'denoising', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'investigator training', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'software as a service', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2020,545239,0.04679160730641234
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10017238,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rod', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2020,243919,0.005879741059702151
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will advance our understanding of the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing.

"Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT) Project Summary/Abstract  The idiosyncrasies of the human brain require that individualized mapping of functional regions be performed before surgical interventions for cancer or epilepsy. The success of this mapping procedure has direct effects on surgical outcomes and preserving cognitive and sensory function post-surgery. Current gold standard procedures for pre-surgical mapping are invasive, time-consuming, and technically demanding. Several non-invasive procedures have emerged in recent years; however, they have not yet displaced the gold standard procedures. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (t-fMRI), the most widely used non-invasive pre-surgical mapping technique, requires that patients perform cognitive or motor tasks while in the scanner—a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Also, not all patients can perform fMRI tasks due to language barriers, sensory deficits, being unconscious, etc. Connectome Fingerprinting (CF) is a recently developed technique that uses machine learning to train a model capable of predicting functional brain activation from task-free resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Once trained on a set of t-fMRI and rs- fMRI data, an unseen subject's unique pattern of brain activation can be predicted using only an rs-fMRI scan of their brain—therefore eliminating the need to perform tasks during the fMRI scan. Despite the promise of CF, the accuracy of the current best practice modeling techniques is not high enough yet to be clinically useful and studies applying CF have nearly always used healthy populations. Much research remains to be done to increase the accuracy of CF models before they can be deployed for pre-surgical mapping.  The long-term objective of the research proposed here is to develop a software application that combines applied machine learning with medical imaging to provide a non-invasive means for mapping the brains of neurosurgical patients before surgery. Importantly, we aim to increase the accuracy of CF modeling by expanding the modeling efforts to probabilistic Bayesian approaches that leverage prior information from the structure of the data. We will test a wide array of tunable data and model parameters to arrive at a current recommendation for best practices in CF research and applications. Finally, we will test our modeling procedures with a dataset of healthy control and pre-surgical patients diagnosed with brain tumors. We will test the software's ability to accurately predict functional brain organization in these patients and adaptively retrain the models to produce the most accurate results. This work has the potential to revolutionize pre-surgical brain mapping and expand its applicability to a greater number of patients. Project Narrative  In the United States, approximately 24,000 new cases of brain tumors are reported each year, with many patients requiring expensive pre-surgical planning and mapping of functional regions to minimize post-surgical impairments. In many neurosurgical practices [96% per 1], this involves performing a time-consuming and costly task-based fMRI acquisitions (nearly $1200/scan in 2014; [2]) before surgery to identify eloquent brain areas recruited for motor control, language, and cognition that must be spared during surgery. By combing task-based fMRI, resting-state fMRI and advanced machine learning to map the functional topology of the brain, the proposed technology will lower pre-surgical planning costs, reduce the burden on physicians and technicians, and expand pre-surgical mapping to previously excluded patients who cannot perform fMRI tasks.",Neurosurgical Planning with Robust Eloquent area Delineation from Individualized Connectivity-based Techniques (NeuroPREDICT),10139299,R43NS117226,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comb animal structure', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Sensory', 'Software Engineering', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'cognitive task', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data quality', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'large scale data', 'motor control', 'multisensory', 'next generation', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'usability']",NINDS,"CHARLES RIVER ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,252569,0.03471026045055742
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9984270,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,411201,-0.06405054338542954
"Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99 Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3). During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs. Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov (biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development), and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE While significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the biological pathways of cognition and emotion, there is concern over the lack of reproducibility of findings. This proposal seeks to develop and apply a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox which will be used to identify and characterize the brain networks underlying healthy and disordered development of executive and emotional processes. The NLA toolbox is a versatile analysis pipeline which leverages the structural and functional architecture of the brain and rigorous statistical testing and validation procedures to define brain-behavior relationships across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease.",Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships,10055480,K99EB029343,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Endocrine', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Processes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'dimensional analysis', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'executive function', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'longitudinal design', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'skills', 'skills training', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'young adult']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,126289,0.01943621596808719
"Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states Project Summary: Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain encodes behavior presents a major challenge for developing effective therapies with which to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of brain-wide measurements of neural connectivity in mammalian models holds great potential for overcoming this challenge. Here we propose an innovative approach for collecting and integrating such data across an unprecedented number of interconnected brain regions for use in elucidating the mechanisms by which sensory processing is altered in disease. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders are triggered or exacerbated by sensory stimuli, yet little is understood about the brain connectivity underlying such sensory hyper/hypo- sensitization. Sensory processing plays a major role in the pathology of: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sensory perception disorders (SPDs), and migraine. Migraine in particular represents a compelling model of sensory hypersensitization, as the response to sensory stimuli is clear, dose- dependent, and measurable. Using state-of-the-art, multi-site in vivo recordings in a well- characterized migraine model, coupled with machine learning, we will develop network-wide electrical maps of the sensory hypersensitivity that underlies migraine. These networks will be validated for their roles in migraine using multiple behavioral assays and migraine-related pharmacological manipulations. We will additionally dissect the mechanisms underlying the sensory hypersensitivity brain state in a mouse model of migraine using optogenetic circuit manipulations as well as single-cell RNA-Seq, with the aim of identifying the contributions of specific circuits, cells, and molecules to this state. This approach is expected to substantially facilitate the use of neural oscillation-based brain networks in biomedical research, as well as provide: 1) a tool for rapid identification of a sensory hypersensitive brain state that can be tested for mechanisms shared across disorders, 2) a map of features of electrical brain networks, which serve as strong hypotheses regarding the routes whereby sensory hypersensitivity brain networks are regulated, and 3) insight into the contributions of specific cell types and molecules to the hypersensitive brain state. Collectively, this study is expected to provide insights into the etiology of migraine and other sensory hypersensitivity disorders that will be critical to developing brain network-based therapies for these diseases. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: This proposal seeks to harness a powerful approach for mapping electrical activity across the brain and to use this information to dissect the biological mechanisms underlying sensory hypersensitivity, a key aspect of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The data collected from this study will provide a comprehensive map of electrical activity in sensory hypersensitivity in a preclinical migraine model; migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder in the general population.

EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG source dynamics and results of existing research using fMRI and other brain imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics,9971588,R01NS047293,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Mail', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Links List', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Paper', 'Plug-in', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'brain research', 'central database', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data cleaning', 'data infrastructure', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'light weight', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'online course', 'open source', 'research study', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'teaching laboratory', 'tool', 'wiki']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,588823,0.05113463558685843
"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of R01MH074457-13, which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data. To date, the BrainMap Project has designed and populated two coordinate-based databases: 1) a task-activation repository (TA DB); and, 2) a voxel-based morphometry repository (VBM DB). The TA DB contains >17,200 experiments, collectively representing > 78,000 subjects and > 110 task- activation paradigms. The VBM DB contains > 3,100 experiments, collectively representing > 81,000 subjects with > 80 psychiatric, neurologic and developmental disorders with ICD-10 coding. The BrainMap Project has created, optimized and validated an integrated pipeline of multi-platform (Javascript), open-access tools to curate (Scribe), filter and retrieve (Sleuth), analyze (GingerALE), visualize (Mango) and interpret analysis output (BrainMap meta-data plugins for Mango). Several network-modeling approaches have been applied to BrainMap data -- MACM, independent components analysis (ICA), graph theory modeling (GTM), author-topic modeling (ATM), structural equation modeling (SEM), and connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) – but none are yet pipeline components. Utilization of these CBMA resources is substantial: BrainMap software, data and meta-data have been used in > 825 peer-reviewed publications. Of these, > 350 were published within the current funding period (April 2015-March 2019; brainmap.org/pubs). In this competing renewal, four tool- development aims are proposed, each of which extends this high-impact research resource. Aim 1. Database Expansion. BrainMap data repositories will be expanded. Aim 2. Meta-analytic Network Modeling. Network modeling will be added to the BrainMap pipeline. Aim 3. Large-Scale Simulations, Comparisons and Validations. Data simulations, characterizations and validations will be performed. Aim 4. Meta-data Inferential tools. Tools for mining BrainMap’s location-linked meta-data will be expanded. Data Sharing Plan. BrainMap data, meta-data, pipeline tools, and templates created by whole-database modeling (e.g., ICA and ATM network masks) are shared at BrainMap.org. Of all new data entries, more than half are contributed by BrainMap users, i.e., community data sharing via BrainMap.org.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,0.039638544667856664
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10004169,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,713309,-0.00014255480770182042
"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current MRSI techniques do not provide the desired combination of resolution, imaging speed and organ coverage for many basic science and clinical applications. The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging problem', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sclerosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'healthy volunteer', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'quantum', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,0.008398175625209421
"The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function Innovations in human neuroimaging tools have driven profound advances in our understanding of brain function under well-controlled and constrained conditions. While we are gaining greater understanding of how the brain functions in single-snapshot experiments under restricted lab settings, we do not know how it works in dynamic, complex and multisensory real-world environments. The goal of this project is to build a portable, miniaturized, lightweight, high-density wearable combined – functional Near Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) – Electro-Encepholography (EEG) - Eye-tracking system for enabling “Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW)” by permitting long duration continuous monitoring of normal / altered brain activity during movement, perception, and social interaction in real time and in the real world. In Aim 1, We will (A) develop a wearable and fully hybrid high-density EEG-fNIRS system that supports autonomous long-term recordings (>6 hours), (B) develop combined and miniaturized active EEG-Electrodes / fNIRS-Optodes; and (C) integrate the wearable system with Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking/scene-camera glasses and state- of-the-art computer vision for adaptive acquisition and automated data annotation. In Aim 2, we will measure brain activity during walking, perceiving, and interacting, with experiments gradually increasing in complexity through three phases from lab to real world settings in young healthy adults and conduct a proof of principle in two sample clinical populations. In Aim 3, we will create an analysis workflow for data collected in Aim 2 that will accomplish the following: (1) removing nuisance signals from fNIRS/EEG signals, (2) analysis of multimodal fNIRS/EEG and behavioral data, (3) automatic annotation of and adaptation for real world measurements. This project brings together engineers, scientists and clinicians with the goal of building the next generation of imaging tools to capture brain function in real time. With our technological sophistication, interdisciplinary focus, and ready access to well-characterized clinical populations, we are uniquely positioned to successfully develop, apply, and disseminate our NEW technology, and lay down a foundation upon which groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the links between brain activity and behavior will build. There is a need to link brain activity to human movement, perception and cognition, and social communication in real time, and in the Everyday World.

"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,9872025,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,0.026063854681860066
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data. These efforts will increase our understanding of normal human brain circuitry and organization and may ultimately contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.",Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex,9995177,R01MH060974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Callithrix', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injections', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'anatomical tracing', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'denoising', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,650574,0.018742231788508645
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9985198,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'structured data', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2020,900723,0.06502721463401183
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9989180,R24MH114788,"['Archives', 'Atlases', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data centers', 'data ecosystem', 'data ingestion', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data resource', 'data standards', 'data submission portal', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'public repository', 'query tools', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2020,1263611,0.061541165131260955
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9934294,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,543993,0.04420062861426629
"Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Resource (LONIR) PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The LONIR is focused on developing innovative solutions for the investigation of imaging, genetics, behavioral and clinical data. The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"Center for Mesoscale Mapping Overview of the Proposed Resource – Abstract The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic- scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain. Our Collaborators will, through a dynamic “push-pull” relationship, provide unique problems which drive the development of these tools, and in return guide us in the design and optimization of our toolbox for practical use in a variety of normal and disease settings. While there is still no formal consensus on the definition of mesoscopic within the neuroscience community, we take as our guide the spatial and temporal scales at which local groups of neurons act in coherent fashion – in the cortex, this includes the spatial scale of columns and laminar structures (between ~0.1-1 mm), while in deeper structures includes the myriad of deep brain and brainstem nuclei. Preliminary data from our own center, and of course others throughout the world, now support the notion that we are on the threshold of being able to map, measure and perturb the human brain at these scales, and do so comprehensively across wide swaths of the human brain. Temporally too, recent advances suggest a convergence between temporal scales addressable with tools like fMRI, which can now investigate delta frequency coherent phenomena, and advanced electromagnetic tools to measure and perturb coherent electrophysiological activity at higher frequencies still. With this convergence in mind, the tools we proposed to develop within the TRDs of the CMM will provide our Collaborative and Service User community with the important “missing links” between the advances in human cognitive neuroscience at the “system level,” and the enormous strides in cellular level circuit functional characterization. Our Collaborators will bring their own unique challenges to help us define and further refine these tools, offering problems requiring distinct measures of human brain structural and functional properties in a variety of normal and disease settings. Our Service Users will utilize our tools to better understand human neural systems, and particularly human disease states from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, to depression and epilepsy. Finally, our Center will seek to disseminate these tools, through open-source software and hardware designs, industrial partnerships and “hands-on” teaching courses for hardware, and to train a new generation of human neuroscientists in the use of our advanced tools to explore the human brain at this next frontier.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,0.018294828741985875
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond. This project continues a successful program of research on the brain mechanisms of placebo effects, taking the work in new directions critical for understanding mental health.",The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes,9842001,R01MH076136,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Conceptions', 'Deception', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Naloxone', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wages', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal function', 'improved', 'negative affect', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'patient expectation', 'placebo analgesia', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'social interventions', 'social model', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,797673,-0.009492718864709433
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,0.03952031263535452
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years. The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para- digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications. Human research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging have been in place for over 40 years and have led to a detailed understand of normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation.

"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10019388,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,381282,0.007413920890872806
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9982966,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'big-data science', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'visual tracking']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2020,202463,0.036288906204500856
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,10022151,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2020,108600,0.05276986547550739
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9980863,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,682143,0.01859262900551805
"G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit Project Summary The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional structure that consists of endothelial cells, surrounded by an extracellular matrix, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. The NVU enables regulation of regional cerebral blood flow and nutrient delivery to the brain tissue. With aging, a structural weakening of the NVU occurs, which is also associated with inflammatory signaling and transport deficiencies. Critically, it is not clear how neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells undergo senescence in the NVU, and whether there are differences in senescence pathways between healthy NVU aging and NVU in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The G-quadruplex (G4) is a non-canonical DNA secondary structure formed by four DNA strands containing multiple runs of guanines. G4s play important roles in DNA recombination, replication, and regulation of transcription. In our data, we demonstrated that brain samples from aged mice contain more G4s than that of young mice. We showed that mice treated with a small-molecule G4 stabilizer develop cognitive impairment and accelerated brain aging. Using a heterochronic parabiosis mouse model, we also showed that the levels of G4s are decreased in the brain of old parabiont, compared to the age-matched iso-parabiotic mice, implicating presence of rejuvenating factors that can reverse the elevation of G4s with aging. The effect of the old parabiont on the young partner is more pronounced (more G4s in the young), suggesting a strong negative influence of aging factors. Importantly, in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that G4s are stabilized in the brains, well before the deposition of amyloid occurs. We hypothesize that these converging lines of evidence point at а mechanism of senescence. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate G4-associated cellular senescence in the NVU, in aging and AD. In Aim 1, we will compare G4s across cell types in the NVU. In Aim 2, we will determine whether G4s preferentially accumulate in the NVUs of brain regions most vulnerable to neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will investigate how a peripheral factor, CXCL10, contributes to NVU's G4 senescence. G4s might be a novel pathway that can be targeted to mitigate the detrimental effects of cellular senescence in the brain. Project Narrative Senescent cells accumulate in aging and drive deficits accompanying age-associated diseases. This project investigates the role of a novel nuclear pathway, the G-quadruplex (G4) DNA pathway, in senescence of neurovascular unit (NVU) in the brain. The formation of G4 DNA is associated with chromatin remodeling, transcriptional changes, and DNA damage; we hypothesize that stabilization of G4s leads to senescence of the components of the NVU - endothelial cells, astrocytes, neurons, and pericytes.",G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit,10044252,RF1AG068292,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytes', 'Binding Proteins', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'CXC chemokine receptor 3', 'CXCL10 gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chromatin', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'G-Quartets', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guanine', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interneurons', 'Lateral', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitotic', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nutrient', 'Parabiosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pericytes', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tg2576', 'Tight Junctions', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Water', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'chromatin remodeling', 'dentate gyrus', 'effective therapy', 'frontal lobe', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'mouse model', 'negative affect', 'neurovascular unit', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'oxidation', 'prevent', 'quadruplex DNA', 'senescence', 'small molecule']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,RF1,2020,1560000,-0.02634578705682516
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity,9959421,R21DK118578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Composition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinically significant', 'connectome', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'energy balance', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'follow-up', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2020,158513,0.04608281113736444
"India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health ABSTRACT Our revised proposal launches the India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health - a globally coordinated study of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), created response to the NIH FOA: Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan (R01; PAR-18-834; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-835.html). Our overall goal is to identify predictive markers in the blood, genome, and epigenome that influence brain aging in India, to better understand prognosis, and to support personalized risk evaluations on each continent. We plan to identify etiological pathways to resilience using the rich biobanking strategy developed by our partners at NIMHANS in India. To do this, we will leverage our global consortium, ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu), to partner with dementia research pioneers in India, creating new links between international biobanks, and building research capacity. By 2020, 70% of the world's population over age 60 will live in developing countries, with 14% in India (Mathuranath 2012). Recently, attention has been drawn to a “diversity” crisis in brain research, as most brain research is conducted in Caucasian populations from relatively wealthy backgrounds (LeWinn 2017). This lack of ethnic diversity means that: (1) we do not know if predictors of health (and disease) generalize to other ethnic groups, and (2) we fail to collect vital data that could teach us how AD progresses in populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Our coordinated analyses in US/EU and Indian biobanks will help identify brain aging predictors specific to India and those that are universal. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Create Lifespan Charts of brain aging Trajectories in India using MRI, DWI and Resting State Functional MRI. Aim 2. Identify Blood and Epigenetic Markers that Predict Brain Aging and AD in India. Aim 3. Using a combination of multimodal imaging, blood markers, and clinical data to predict clinical decline in India. We test structural equation models that hypothesize how brain aging depends on lifestyle and psychosocial factors (diet, family support, drug abuse, literacy, sleep, and depression), as well as sex, education, and AD genetic risk. With novel machine learning methods, will analyze blood markers and plasma proteomic analytes, to define processes that are harmful to brain aging. In Capacity Building Aims, we will leverage ENIGMA's successful strategies to train emerging and established scientists in India to analyze their data with high quality control and precision, with targeted biostatistical and imaging workshops to bolster capacity. This collaborative India-US initiative will enable future science initiatives, and equip the NIMHANS team with the necessary tools to train new scientists and independently conduct high impact research bridging efforts into numerous international partnerships.

"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9976610,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,197545,0.017765325041835065
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,10001025,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,724789,0.05012499926857403
"Graspy: A python package for rigorous statistical analysis of populations of attributed connectomes PROJECT SUMMARY Overview: We will extend and develop implementations of foundational methods for analyzing populations of attributed connectomes. Our toolbox will enable brain scientists to (1) infer latent structure from individual connectomes, (2) identify meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detect relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes. The methods we develop and extend will naturally overcome the challenges inherent in connectomics: high-dimensional non-Euclidean data with multi-level nonlinear interactions. Our implementations will comply with the highest open-source standards by: providing extensive online documentation and extended tutorials, hosting workshops to demonstrate our tools on an annual basis, and merging our implementations into commonly used packages such as scikit-learn [1], scipy [2], and networkx [3]. All of the code we develop is open source. We strive to ensure that our code is shared in accordance with the strictest guiding principles. We chose to implement these algorithms in Python due to its wide adoption in the neuroscience and data science fields. In particular, many other neuroscience tools applicable to connectomics, including NetworkX DiPy, mindboggle, nilearn, and nipy, are also implemented in Python. This will enable researchers to chain our analysis tools onto pre-existing pipelines for data preprocessing and visualization. Nonetheless, we feel that sharing our code in our own public repositories is insufficient for global reach. We have also begun reaching out to developers of the leading data science packages in python, including scipy, sklearn, networkx, scikit-image, and DiPy. For each of those packages, we have informal approval to begin integrating algorithms that we have developed. Those packages are collectively used by >220,000 other packages, so merging our algorithms into those packages will significantly extend our global reach. All researchers investigating connectomics, including all the authors of the 24,000 papers that mention the word “connectome”, will be able to apply state-of-the-art statistical theory and methods to their data. Currently, we have about 150 open source software projects on our NeuroData GitHub organization. Collectively, these projects get about 2,000 downloads and >11,000 views per month. As we incorporate additional functionality as described in this proposal, we expect far more researchers across disciplines and sectors will utilize our software. 20 ​ ​​ ​ ​​ Project Narrative Connectomes are an increasingly important modality for characterizing the structure of the brain, to complement behavior, genetics, and physiology. We and others have developed foundational statistical theory and methods over the last decade for the analysis of networks, networks with edge, vertex, and other attributes, and populations thereof, with preliminary implementations of those tools that we leverage in our laboratory for various application papers. In this project, we will extend our package, called graspy, to be of professional quality, implementing key functionality to include (1) estimating latent structure from attributed connectomes, (2) identifying meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detecting relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes, such as behavior, genetics, and physiology. 18",Graspy: A python package for rigorous statistical analysis of populations of attributed connectomes,10012519,RF1MH123233,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Coin', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'data pipeline', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high standard', 'open source', 'public repository', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1246005,0.01877467372518402
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing. New applications of these tools this will lead deeper insight into the role of networks in health as well as in clinical disorders.",CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience,10019389,R01EB029272,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Elements', 'France', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'brain computer interface', 'cloud based', 'cognitive process', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'open data', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'support network', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2020,218594,0.026636257039430563
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",10002220,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'data tools', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,20957,0.020714203042376575
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9999578,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,20198,0.01801369099389808
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",10000156,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,128619,0.009084576762795839
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9971584,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2020,193125,0.030201711672361277
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10050097,R01AG065288,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Biofeedback', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Micturition Reflex', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Premenopause', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Refractory', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Spasm', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Woman', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'innovation', 'micturition urgency', 'mind control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,624134,-0.015010126055158182
"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction. Second, we hope to improve computer performance by using insights into how the brain computes.",CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space,9994975,R01DC017695,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Burn injury', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Dreams', 'Drosophila genus', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfaction Disorders', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'combinatorial', 'computational basis', 'computer science', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning community', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'red wine', 'response', 'theories']",NIDCD,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,446764,0.028203353305037048
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general. Narrative Title: Structural development of human fetal brain The goal is to establish next-generation diffusion MRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural measurement by delineating its four-dimensional spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants.

"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide. Here we propose to use a host of new technology platforms to create a fully integrated whole human brain cell atlas with unprecedented levels of resolution and completeness.",Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution,9935968,U01MH117072,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Fiber', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'antibody libraries', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'lens', 'macromolecule', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'spectrograph', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2020,1563930,0.04551523494309424
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,0.042384803550767666
"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,9971052,R01AG067420,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'safety testing', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,533173,-0.01705089534786859
"High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids Experimental models of the human developing brain are needed to investigate human-specific aspects of brain development, evolution, and neurological disease. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of models, considering that the endogenous developing human brain cannot be directly investigated; animal models often fail to recapitulate human disorders and cannot feasibly be used to study complex polygenic states spanning many genes. While reductionist in nature, stem-cell derived 3D human brain organoids offer a first-of- its-kind opportunity to study processes of human brain formation and wiring that are otherwise not accessible. However, there is an unmet need for organoid models that are cellularly complete and reproducible and for methodology to decode the establishment, connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. If we could map the activity and connectivity of organoids at scale, both to understand circuit function/dysfunction and to guide further development of organoids, we could close the loop on organoid design and application. Towards this goal, we have developed many molecular and imaging tools for high-throughput analysis of neural activity and connectivity, which we propose to apply to new, next-generation organoid models. Here, we propose a collaborative approach among four groups (Arlotta - brain organoids and human brain development; Boyden - circuit physiology and neural imaging technology; Lewis - material science and bioengineering and Insoo Hyun- bioethics) to pioneer a robust organoid system that combines the development of vascularized brain organoids incorporating more complete cell diversity and maturation with advanced high-throughput functional molecular and imaging tools to enable interrogation of circuit activity, connectivity, and molecular changes in cells participating in physiologically relevant circuits. We will build on a highly reproducible brain organoid model that we recently developed to promote the generation of cell types that are currently absent in organoids but needed for circuit maturation, refinement, and functionality. This work is intended to generate more advanced organoid models designed to promote maturation and robust network activity. In parallel, we will develop a pipeline to record neural activity from intact organoids using all- optical-electrophysiology techniques at scale, and optimize epitope-based barcoding and expansion microscopy to enable molecularly-annotated connectomics of brain organoids. The work proposed here will enable the use of human organoid models to study human circuit formation, plasticity, and function, analyses that are currently hampered by the lack of technologies and assays for high-throughput measurements of circuit physiology and connectivity in organoids. Beyond the work proposed here, these methods will directly enable investigation into how disease states alter information processing in the brain; for example, linking mutations in disease-associated genes with specific abnormalities in human neurons and circuits to inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative  Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions worldwide and are of enormous public health significance; however, we have a very limited understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying these diseases. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of research models, given that animal models often fail to recapitulate the human disease, and that, while 3D human brain organoids offer experimental access to processes of human brain formation and wiring, methodology is needed to decode circuit function and connectivity in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. We propose here to pioneer the development of next-generation, vascularized brain organoids and to apply novel, scalable molecular and imaging tools to enable investigation of human neural circuits in health and disease.",High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids,10049677,RF1MH123977,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epitopes', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optics', 'Organoids', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cell type', 'collaborative approach', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'information processing', 'materials science', 'model design', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular scale', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cells', 'synaptic pruning']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2509021,0.004516832097741182
"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,9901500,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,183179,-0.024099447829013975
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9936242,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,192828,0.007798029239098511
"Mapping human brain perivascular space in lifespan using human connectome project data PROJECT SUMMARY Perivascular spaces are a critical component of the glia-lymphatic circuit, facilitating the clearance of soluble waste. The role of perivascular spaces and changes in the brain’s clearance system in normal development, aging, and cognition is not fully understood, mainly due to lack of neuroimaging capabilities. However, noninvasive in vivo mapping of the perivascular space fluid with high accuracy and reliability is now made possible with our recent analytical developments, using human connectome project (HCP) data. The objective of this project is to map structural and diffusion features of perivascular space fluid across lifespan. PVS features include PVS presence (e.g., count and volume fraction) and diffusion (e.g., diffusivity and anisotropy). These features will be extracted regionally and globally across the brain. Structural MRI will provide information regarding localization and extent of the PVS and diffusion MRI will be used to investigate biophysical properties of the PVS fluid and surrounding tissue. The central hypothesis is that the perivascular space fluid increases across lifespan. We also hypothesize that individual differences exist in perivascular spaces as a function of demographic, general health and lifestyle health choices, such as body mass index, blood pressure, tobacco use and sleep quality. The central hypothesis will be tested by characterizing the normative map of the perivascular space fluid across the lifespan and in relation to various demographic, cognitive measures, and health factors. We will also examine whether subjects neuro-behavioral performances can be predicted by perivascular space features. We will pursue these aims by applying innovative MRI-based computational techniques that we recently developed and optimized on HCP data. We will also use Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Studies to build first normative template of PVS in neurodevelopment. Together, our findings will ultimately allow for a better understanding of the human brain clearance system, and our shared perivascular space mapping workflow can provide a resource for researchers to study a wide range of neurological conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to fill our gap knowledge regarding the role of the clearance system in brain health and cognition and its neuroimaging signature. We will identify and provide access to quantitative morphological and diffusion features of brain glia-lymphatic network to the larger scientific community to help facilitate our understanding of what role the brain clearance system has across lifespan.

"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets these needs with well-documented and tested novel analyses using MEG and EEG in combination with anatomical MRI and intracranial EEG data.",BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging,9894648,R01EB026299,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Institution', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cloud storage', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'cortex mapping', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'data structure', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'graphical user interface', 'hands on instruction', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'magnetic field', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,633469,0.029479987813575737
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9897563,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,202864,0.02465500164066308
