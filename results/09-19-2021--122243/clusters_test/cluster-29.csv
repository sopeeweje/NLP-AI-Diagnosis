"Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may prefer to avoid these interventions.  To address these gaps, we have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led, video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication, increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. We will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids that we have developed. The ACP Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the palliative care team. The ACP Educator, who will be a palliative care nurse, will work with older patients or patients with ADRD and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.  The overall objective is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 by expanding the reach of inpatient palliative care, especially for patients with ADRD. We propose to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of an ACP Educator intervention among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over, or any patient with ADRD and their proxy decision-makers in the ward and ICU settings of two major hospitals: Boston Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital. Patient outcomes will be abstracted from electronic health records with Natural Language Processing. We will evaluate intervention effectiveness by comparing the following outcomes among 9,000 hospitalized patients: ACP documentation; preferences for resuscitation; palliative care consults; and, hospice use. We will characterize caregiver-centered outcomes of patients with ADRD, including: (1) knowledge, (2) confidence in future care, (3) communication satisfaction, and (4) decisional certainty in 600 caregivers of patients with ADRD admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 poses a unique dilemma for older Americans and patients with ADRD and their caregivers, who must balance their desire to live against the risk of a lonely and potentially traumatic hospital death. Video decision support is a practical, evidence- based, and innovative approach to assist patients facing such choices. If proven effective, this innovative care model can be immediately deployed across the country to improve the quality of care for millions of Americans. The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. We aim to improve ACP with an ACP Educator who will promote ACP conversations with certified video decision aids in a model of care that is practical, scalable, and evidence-based, has the potential to mitigate communication barriers related to health literacy and limited English proficiency, and has the potential to improve the quality of medical care delivered to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia,10251623,R01AG072911,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Boston', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communication', 'Communication Barriers', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limited English Proficiency', 'Loneliness', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Palliative Care Nursing', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'University Hospitals', 'Work', 'aged', 'care systems', 'compare effectiveness', 'dementia care', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health literacy', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'pandemic disease', 'patient-clinician communication', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'visual information', 'ward']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2487017
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,10188647,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'provider factors', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694144
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,10214688,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,738379
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,10224085,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,485426
"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development. The proposed research and career plan will enable Dr. Parikh to transition to an independent physician-scientist devoted to the quality and applicability of predictive analytics in the care of patients with cancer. a PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to improve prognostication for patients with advanced cancer by developing frameworks to integrate clinician intuition with machine learning algorithm- based mortality risk predictions (“human-machine collaborations”), a critical step to better identify patients who may benefit from earlier advance care planning and palliative care. This research proposal will optimize an existing machine learning mortality risk prediction algorithm and methodologically assess strategies to present machine learning estimates to clinicians in order to increase prognostic accuracy, advance care planning, and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. The project is relevant to the NCI's mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to improve and integrate predictive algorithms into clinical practice, thereby allowing better targeting of evidence-based interventions to improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.",Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer,10284721,K08CA263541,"['Advance Care Planning', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Jail', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human model', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'outcome forecast', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction', 'routine care']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,231174
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,10137995,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'participant enrollment', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health', 'risk prediction model', 'statistical learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172704
"Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting >33.5 million adults world- wide. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also highly prevalent and affects 14% of the U.S. and North American population. The burden of AF is 3-fold higher in CKD and affects up to 25% of CKD patients. AF is strongly associated with risk of ischemic stroke and death; and these risks are even higher in patients with CKD. Even in the absence of clinical ischemic stroke, some studies have suggested that AF is also associated with excess risks of all dementia types, including Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, although definitive evidence is lacking. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the brain, including amyloid depositions and neurofibrillary tangles. It is plausible that AF may lead to cerebral microinfarcts, cerebral hemorrhage and reduced cerebral blood flow, all which could promote Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Gaining a greater understanding of the association of AF with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is particularly important in the CKD population, in whom the incidence and prevalence of dementia is even higher compared with the general population; and in whom the cause of dementia remains elusive and thus largely untreated. Currently, data on the risk of dementia in patients with CKD and AF are limited and may provide new insight into the mechanisms that contribute to dementia in CKD patients. Further, data on whether treatment of AF mitigates risk of dementia are conflicting in all populations (regardless of CKD status). While there are some existing studies of treatment of AF and risk of dementia, most have limitations, including (1) a primary focus on anticoagulation and not a comprehensive evaluation of other AF therapies; (2) inclusion of selected populations and none with CKD; and (3) inadequate consideration of interim clinical measures that may affect receipt and outcomes of AF therapies. Therefore, the effects of successful treatment of AF on risk of dementia remains largely unknown. Further data could identify novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of dementia. We propose to efficiently leverage our unique research platform that includes “real-world” contemporary data to evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with AF, with and without CKD; as well as determine whether successful treatment of AF with a comprehensive range of therapies is linked to a lower risk of dementia. To conduct this work, we will perform a rigorous comparative effectiveness analysis of >500,000 patients with and without AF from two participating health care systems in California. This proposed supplemental project will yield key insights to understanding the link between AF and dementia; particularly in the high-risk population of those with CKD. Furthermore, the anticipated results could form the basis of future randomized clinical trials. NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation is very common, particularly in patients with kidney disease. Studies have suggested that atrial fibrillation may be linked to dementia. In this study, we will evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with concurrent atrial fibrillation and kidney disease; and determine whether successful treatment of atrial fibrillation is linked with lower risk of dementia in this population.",Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD,10287433,R01HL142834,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Incidence', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Procedures', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sinus', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'cerebral microinfarct', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness analysis', 'dementia risk', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'insight', 'mortality risk', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'population based', 'response', 'success', 'therapy adverse effect', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,409448
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,10217209,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,402815
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,10176558,R01HL142503,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,775715
"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,10215584,K23HD100594,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Assessment tool', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Carbapenems', 'Caring', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hand', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hygiene', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resort', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'biobank', 'carbapenem resistance', 'career', 'classification trees', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'critically ill newborn', 'health care model', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'low and middle-income countries', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neonatal care', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rectal', 'regression trees', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,170876
"Development of quantitative tools to predict patients with difficult intubation to minimize treatment related complications ABSTRACT Endotracheal mouth/nose breathing need 10% this to performing subjective poorly standard Unfortunately, these airway examination systems in clinical practice perform only modestly, with sensitivities of 20-62%, specificities of 82-97%, and very low positive predictive values, generally less than 30%, unless very liberal definitions of difficulty are used. There are likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, the multifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failure to validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy of the tests themselves. intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via the into the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to ameliorate difficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness.

The clinica l significance of “can't intubate, can't ventilate” scenario is extremely important: 25% of anesthetic related deaths are due airway mishaps. Patients are typically assessed for anatomic features that might predict difficulty in EI prior to the procedure. In practice, anesthesiologists and other airway experts likely weigh other factors in anticipating a difficult airway, including habitus, facial appearance, and perhaps other understood hunches.

"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,10110031,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'clinical trial implementation', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,592501
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on our elderly population living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In particular, care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is extremely challenging due to their special needs and difficulty adhering to social distancing requirements. This administrative supplement under the Stanford Aging and Ethogeriatrics (SAGE) Research Center (P30 AG059307) will examine the emotional distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dementia risk in racial minorities. Aim 1 will examine the extent to which COVID-19-imposed emotional distress mediates the association between childhood social distress and late-life increased risk of dementia by race. Aim 2 will examine the mental health and coping strategies of aging minority residents in nursing homes during the COVID- 19 pandemic by recruiting respondents in nursing homes in selected segregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMAs). These results are expected to shed new light on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the effects of emotional distress on minorities living with dementia and how coping strategies may help to mitigate that risk and the provision of dementia care. Our results from both Aims will be integrated and complement each other by providing robust statistical evidence on the association between stress and ADRD as well as first-hand evidence and perspectives from residents and caregivers, who are currently at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project Narrative: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely taking an enormous toll on the mental health of elderly minority patients and their caregivers in long-term care facilities. The results of this administrative supplement project will provide significant insights into the emotional impact of the pandemic on patients with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and ultimately lead to the design of more effective coping strategies for handling stressful events and improve the overall provision of care.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE),10268030,P30AG059307,"['Accounting', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Late Effects', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Race', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'aging population', 'comorbidity', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'dementia care', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'emotional distress', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health economics', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial discrimination', 'racial minority', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stressor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,197125
"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10266125,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,903251
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539
"Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery ABSTRACT Neonates (infants ≤ 28 days), especially those with congenital heart disease (CHD), are among the most vulnerable populations cared for by critical care nurses. Approximately, two out of three CHD neonates experience unintentional hypothermia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Unintentional hypothermia impairs cellular function, which can be linked to poor outcomes frequently reported in this population. To date, there are no studies examining the association between the burden of unintentional hypothermia and clinical outcomes in neonates with CHD. This knowledge would render future opportunities to improve nursing care and prevent avoidable safety events in these vulnerable neonates. To address this gap, we propose to use retrospective data from CardioAccess (database local to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia [CHOP]), which includes one of the largest multicenter repositories of neonatal cardiac surgery data available to date (Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium [PC4]), as well as, the electronic health record. Using data from at least 432 neonates who have undergone CPB between 2015 and 2019, we will quantify the time course of hourly temperature trajectories within the initial 24–48 hours after CPB and evaluate their relation to key clinical outcomes. We will specifically study the temporal trends of unintentional hypothermia burden (temperature depth and duration), which challenges current practice, where care is based on maintaining a single, preselected temperature threshold that is driven by consensus, rather than evidence. Single threshold values are not dynamic representations of the complexity that makes up temperature. A more robust output, such as an accumulative hypothermia burden index, is needed to assist clinicians with interpretation of this dynamic indicator of overall health. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Identify distinct temporal temperature patterns in CHD neonates after CPB using both: a multilevel model for intensive longitudinal data with group-based trajectory modeling; and an unsupervised machine learning technique using principal component analysis followed by k- means clustering of longitudinal data. 2) Determine the relationship between hypothermia burden subgroups / clusters and important clinical outcomes in this population. Our team has a demonstrated expertise in building clinically relevant and physiologically plausible markers of adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. This study aligns with the NINR’s priorities of promoting wellness and preventing illness across the lifespan, as well as, using recent advances in precision medicine. The research conducted under this award will take place at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, a research-intensive institution (data analysis), and CHOP (data provision). The personalized training plan outlined in this application, supports the applicant’s career and academic development goals to become an independent nurse researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Unintentional hypothermia can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD), which has a prevalence at birth in the USA of ~1% or 40,000 cases per year, and of those, ~6,000 neonates are born with severe defects requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, contributing to a total cost of ~$5.6 billion every year. This will be the first clinical study to define the prevalence of unintentional hypothermia and map its association to neonatal outcomes with CHD, which has major implications for clinical practice. Unveiling the prevalence and consequences of unintentional hypothermia in this vulnerable population will render future opportunities to enhance time to recognition and early choice of preemptive intervention, which can improve the quality and safety of care, save lives and productivity, as well as, health care dollars.",Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery,10233671,F31NR019725,"['Address', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consensus', 'Cost of Illness', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Integumentary system', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'PC4 Gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Philadelphia', 'Physiological', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Safety', 'School Nursing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight Gain', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'critical care nursing', 'database query', 'early onset', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multilevel analysis', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2021,48536
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients. This project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of electrical hearing in patients with USH and strives to apply this knowledge to reduce disability in all patients with cochlear implants.",AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME,10192995,R21DC019458,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory system', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Nerve', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Interphase', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery of Function', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Usher Syndrome', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'deaf', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'ganglion cell', 'hearing impairment', 'histological studies', 'individual patient', 'model development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron loss', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'point of care', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'restoration', 'spiral ganglion', 'supervised learning', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196406
"Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD Project Summary This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions, predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations, is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk- prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research. Project Narrative Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital have high rates of early readmission; these readmissions are a significant burden to the health care system. The proposed research will combine social information with rich clinical data to develop a real-time readmission risk prediction algorithm that will be integrated into a patient-centric intervention and tested in real-world clinical practice settings. The information learned from this project will assist in providing individualized treatment at the transition from hospital to home and focused on reducing healthcare utilization and ultimately improving quality of care.",Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD,10215337,K23HL153582,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Buffaloes', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'biomedical informatics', 'care coordination', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient safety', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'social', 'social disadvantage', 'social factors', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NHLBI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,K23,2021,192411
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting program’s impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,10173872,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2021,146648
"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions. We developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately estimating risk of CDI. This study will use the tool to target antimicrobial stewardship CDI-prevention bundle recommendations toward patients at highest risk who are missed by current case finding strategies and investigate whether this will decrease rates of CDI.",Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI),10208953,R03HS027208,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R03,2021,62445
"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population. Narrative Dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. We aim to leverage multimodal data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics.

"Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with cancer who live in rural settings experience worse outcomes as compared to those in urban settings. Individuals in rural regions have difficulty accessing supportive care services due to travel challenges, cost of services, and overall lack of available supportive care resources. The latter issue likely contributes greatly to the urban/rural survival differences, given that multiple studies document that regularly addressing patient symptoms has a survival benefit in the setting of advanced cancer. Technology may provide solutions to overcome issues of rurality, however, little work has been done to specifically leverage technology- based solutions to deliver high quality supportive care in rural settings. Our team has developed and pilot tested a tablet-based symptom assessment and supportive care intervention called Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) that was well received by patients with metastatic cancer, including a subset of rural patients living in non-metropolitan counties (Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) counties of 4 or higher). Patients were provided a tablet and cellular data plan to allow them to answer symptom questions daily, and an embedded personalized decision tree then offered evidence based self-care interventions to address the self-reported symptom with a goal of improving overall health and well-being. A pedometer and resistance band were also provided, given evidence that physical activity can assist with all four of the symptoms addressed in Nurse AMIE (fatigue, sleep, distress, and pain). These four symptoms form the basis of the psychoneurological symptom cluster that has been noted to be associated with quality of life and survival in oncology patients. Nurse AMIE can conduct symptom assessment, track data, and provide interventions offline if internet access is unavailable. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates acceptability and feasibility of the tablet-based approach as our patients logged on 57% of intervention days. Furthermore, patients using Nurse AMIE reported high patient satisfaction with the self-care system. Based on findings from the pilot, we propose to add a weekly survey similar to that from prior research by Basch et al. and Denis et al. to expand the symptom assessment aspect of the platform. We propose that this distance based supportive care intervention (Nurse AMIE) will have significant effects on rural patients overall survival (primary outcome), cancer treatment-related symptoms, function, and health related quality of life. We will focus our efforts on N=344 underserved or low-income adult men and women living in non-metropolitan counties (RUCC codes 4- 9) that have low access to supportive care. This work will be carried out with the help of a strong community advisory board, and guided by the PA and WV State Offices of Rural Health. We will enroll and randomize patients to receive the Nurse AMIE supportive care intervention or usual care. Enrollment will occur at regularly scheduled medical visits and the intervention will extend for the length of follow-up (2 years). We will also examine the cost effectiveness of Nurse AMIE. Nurse AMIE Project Narrative Rural patients with metastatic cancer are less likely to have access to high quality supportive care. This may have a negative effect on survival and well-being. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the survival benefits of a high quality technology based supportive care platform among 344 underserved, low income patients with metastatic cancer living in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia.",Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV,10085516,R01CA254659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Cancer Patient', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distress', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Nurses', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Schedule', 'Self Care', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'West Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost estimate', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'men', 'opportunity cost', 'pedometer', 'personalized decision', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'rural setting', 'rural underserved', 'rurality', 'symptom cluster', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor', 'urban setting', 'usual care arm']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,656763
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,10144365,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2122297
"Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock Project Summary  Physicians in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) make decisions in an increasingly data- and knowledge- rich world, yet often they get little help. Currently, each physician makes decisions based on his or her mental model of the patient’s physiology, together with mental predictions of the patient’s response to intervention. This approach can lead to a range of behaviors that compromise patient outcomes, including oversimplification of the physiology, errors due to cognitive overload, and physician to physician variability in decision making. A computational tool equipped with quantitative knowledge of physiology, the ability to systematically evaluate all the data, and informed by a database of past action-outcome events could aid the physician with valuable suggestions for action.  We propose to train an algorithm to make decisions about dosing vasoactive medications and initiating mechanical support in patients with cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure. This focused set of decisions entails calculations about the physiology that are normally performed in a physician’s head. We frame the decision problem as optimizing cardiovascular function to preserve oxygen delivery, and we apply tools from optimal control. Rather than hand-design a CCU controller we will use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to “fit” one. The field of RL has experienced explosive growth over the past few years, with notable advances in strategic decision problems and robotics. A key challenge in the clinical environment is that the exploration phase of learning (“trial and error”) would be unethical in real patients. A second challenge is that the availability of patient data, while growing, is likely to be a bottleneck. We will leverage state-of-the-art model-based RL to train an algorithm using a combination of simulation and off-policy learning from historical data. We will use a model of cardiovascular physiology that underlies cardiac simulators in use today for the training of cardiologists. Historical patient data will come from the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Animation Center which has recorded real-time telemetry waveform data in addition to standard electronic medical record data from all CCU patients spanning several years. This is one of the largest and most complete datasets of its kind. The complexity of managing cardiogenic shock will continue to escalate as tools become more sophisticated and patients live longer, with more extensive comorbidities. Advanced decision support tools could help tame this complexity, improving the quality of care as well as democratizing it. Project Narrative The sickest cardiac patients are treated in the intensive care unit and are complex to manage. We aim to create a tool that will use artificial intelligence to study a patient's data and offer a physician advice. Our goal is to improve the patient's chance of survival and shorten their time in intensive care.",Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock,10218696,R21EB030756,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'animation', 'base', 'cardiac intensive care unit', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital health', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unethical']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2021,252000
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,10200136,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'four-arm study', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation process', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'text messaging intervention', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2021,1417404
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10020889,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2021,1924651
"Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY Background: We are experiencing an event unlike any in living history. The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. The size, scope, and speed of this pandemic has created an imperative for rapid dissemination of data and findings. The response of US primary care practices to COVID-19 is a large-scale natural experiment of the capacity of primary care to meet the majority of people's needs. And yet, at the start the pandemic in the US, there was no one organization, federal agency, or national dataset able to provide real-time on-the-ground data regarding the experiences of primary care practices or their patients. Purpose: On March 13, 2020, as the US declared COVID-19 a national emergency, our team created a national research Collaboratory and launched the “Quick COVID-19 Primary Care Survey” (C19 Survey) to fill that gap. The Pilot C19 Survey began as a clinician-based weekly national survey to monitor the response, challenges, and capacity of US primary care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 4 weeks, we launched a complementary patient-based C19 Survey. People Are Primary would allow the C19 Surveys to continue beyond the Pilot stage. We will examine the responses, challenges, and capacity of primary care practices in order to evaluate the resilience and adaptive decision- making required during the pandemic. Drawing on both patients and clinicians, we will examine the rapid adoption of digital health by primary care as well as the positive and negative consequences of digital health on 1) access to care across varied settings, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with relationships between primary care patients and primary care teams. Methods: This is a mixed-methods learning evaluation with an exploratory sequential design. Regular surveys will be distributed to identified clinician and patient groups throughout the 2-year study period. These will begin weekly and will evolve into biweekly and then monthly surveys in response to changes in the natural evolution of the pandemic and subsequent primary care practice response. The research team will engage in weekly rapid learning cycles that complete data collection, analysis, dissemination, and adjustment to survey instrument within a 7-day period. The team will also use bimonthly deep learning cycles to develop time series and trend- based analysis, offering a more extended conversation of these findings and their implications for the long-term stability and strengthening of the US primary care platform. Benefit: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the costs of chronic and fragmented under-investment in primary care. Examination of the rapid adoption of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care. PROJECT NARRATIVE FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world.

Examination of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much-needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care.","Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19",10193445,R01HS028253,[' '],AHRQ,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,491317
"IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) Although healthcare costs in the United States rank among the highest in the world, critical health outcomes rank lower than other high resource countries. In an effort to improve healthcare quality and concomitantly reduce costs, Congress identified certain serious and expensive but preventable hospital acquired conditions such as patient falls, pressure ulcer injuries (PUI) and hospital acquired infections (HAI), that would no longer be reimbursed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These preventable adverse events have been linked with nursing time with patients. Nurses play a critical role in preventing adverse outcomes by quickly identifying patients at risk, evaluating the extent of these risks, and acting upon the changing status of the patient, a process termed “nurse surveillance.” Hence, nurses are key contributors to overall patient surveillance and safety. The Joint Commission recommends that the nurses give report at the patient bedside, termed “bedside shift report” (BSR), to reduce errors and improve continuity of care; hourly rounds (HR) are also recommended to reduce falls; both of these measures contribute to nurse surveillance of patients, but their relationship to patient outcomes remains understudied. NewYork-Presbyterian, a large academic health system, is piloting an innovative technology called “iN,” to improve BSR and HR through the use of color-changing lights and integrated mobile app to remind nurses when these activities have not been completed. This technology uses a combination of mounted hardware in the patient room with obfuscated computer vision to provide constant surveillance of the patient room and companion software supplied via a mobile phone app that integrates these technologies. This novel intervention to increase BSR and HR by nurses, which generates detailed process data, offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain a complete understanding of all activities that take place at the bedside and yet has not yet been studied to characterize nurse surveillance or to assess associations with related patient outcomes. The IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) study will characterize nurse surveillance and its influence on patient falls, HAI, and PUI to generate new knowledge about factors that influence these nurse-sensitive patient outcomes. Using the dataset built in this study that will integrate data from the iN device, electronic health record, staffing and census data, and hospital reported quality measures on falls, HAI and PUIs, this prospective cohort study design will use descriptive statistics and a Cox-proportional hazard model to characterize nurse surveillance and the contribution of BSR and HR to nurse surveillance to generate predictive indicators of these nurse-sensitive outcomes (falls, PUIs HAIs), which can be used to identify intervention targets. The IMPORTANT study addresses AHRQ’s specific priorities to conduct “Research to improve health care patient safety,” and “Harness data and technology to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes and to provide a 360-degree view of the patient” and will address AHRQ priority populations of the those with multiple chronic conditions, minorities, and women. Project Narrative This “IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT)” study will explore an innovative technology that will capture information about a technology-enabled intervention to improve nurse surveillance and subsequent nurse-sensitive patient outcomes: patient falls, pressure ulcer injury, and hospital acquired infections. This study will provide an enhanced understanding of nursing interactions with patients at the bedside and subsequent effects on related patient outcomes through the use of both existing data and novel technology.",IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT),10131779,R03HS027006,[' '],AHRQ,HUNTER COLLEGE,R03,2021,51444
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,10176417,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,407634
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'provider behavior', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug Modelings', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hospitalists', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detection platform', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'equipment training', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'high risk', 'imaging agent', 'implementation cost', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-drug', 'post intervention', 'premature', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198
"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require “escalation”, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902
"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive interventions.",Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes,10178979,R01CA258193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Late Effects', 'Link', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'associated symptom', 'behavioral health', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'dashboard', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'outcome prediction', 'patient portal', 'patient variability', 'personalized risk prediction', 'premature', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep behavior', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool']",NCI,ST.

"AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-20-034, the proposed Alzheimer’s-focused supplement will develop Connecting Audio And Radio Sensing Systems To Improve Care At Home for persons with early Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers. The research proposed in this supplement aligns with the parent R01 study (R01LM013329). Persons with ADRD and their caregivers routinely confront various complex challenges and experience huge care burden. A common practice in technology-assisted care intervention is to guide patients and family caregivers through web and mobile phone-based training, health-vital monitoring, symptom reporting, and providing feedback and advice. These intervention programs, while have been shown to be effective, have three major demerits. First, a member of the care team (the patient or a family member) has to actively measure and enter patient data into the system, which is error-prone, subjective, and sometimes, forgotten. Second, web or mobile-based interactions can be cumbersome and demanding. Simple tasks like entering data, assessing health status, or getting and responding to an alert require typing and clicking through a series of electronic forms. Third, interactions between the system and the caregiver, especially when the system needs to remind or confirm an intervention, simple notifications and messages on a smartphone/website is often ineffective and unnoticed. To improve technology-based care interventions and to better serve persons with ADRD and their caregivers, the proposed study will adopt a user-centered approach to adapt and extend the AURA system that we have been developing in our ongoing R01. The research aims are: 1) Increase the robustness of the AURA subsystems; 2) Engage stakeholders (persons with early ADRD, caregivers, clinicians) to identify the needs of ADRD care and caregiving to help co-produce AURA-ALZ for persons with early ADRD and their caregivers; 3) Determine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of AURA-ALZ in 10 persons with early ADRD and caregiver dyads' homes using mixed methods. Our current R01 aims to develop a technology- assisted AURA system for patients who are post-surgical treatment for bladder cancer and their caregivers. AURA passively monitors specific activities of a patient at home using WiFi signals, tailors natural language responses of voice assistants based on the patient's state, and automates entering data into the system to reduce the burden on the caregivers of cancer. AURA communicates with the care team in natural languages for reminders and confirmation of collected information, which is intuitive, handsfree, and less demanding. Building upon AURA, AURA-ALZ will have similar but enhanced features to address the unique care needs of persons with ADRD and caregivers. This study addresses the NLM’s mission of enabling biomedical research, supporting health care and public health, and promoting healthy behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the proposed study, we plan to adopt a user-centered approach to develop AURA-ALZ, an extended and adapted version of our innovative eHealth AURA program, to meet the needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Different from previous interventions that focus on counseling, support groups, education, and skills training, AURA-ALZ will provide continuous monitoring of daily activities and gestures using a novel WiFi-based sensing technique, and enable voice-based user interactions, automated reminders, and hands-free surveys for guiding future individualized interventions for persons with early ADRD, which will help reduce caregiver burden, and ultimately, improve the health outcomes of the patients and caregivers.",AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers,10289180,R01LM013329,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Auras', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Patient', 'Car Phone', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'cognitive ability', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'dementia caregiving', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional loss', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'learning classifier', 'member', 'multi-component intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'radio frequency', 'remote health care', 'research study', 'response', 'skills training', 'usability', 'web site']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,75537
"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188709

"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, compare clinical management of hypertension with and without information from the MLA on whether a patient will have uncontrolled blood pressure through a case-vignette study.",Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia,10167764,K01HL151974,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Bass', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Education', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Life Style Modification', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Intervention', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Zoran', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'informant', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'underserved area']",NHLBI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K01,2021,147931
"Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making Project Summary Although close monitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU care, both are limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers. Currently, dynamic and precise assessment of patient’s acuity in ICU rely almost exclusively on physicians’ clinical judgment and vigilance. Furthermore, important visual assessment details, such as facial expressions, posture, and mobility, are captured sporadically by overburdened nurses or are not captured at all. However, these visual assessment details are associated with critical indices such as physical function, pain and subsequent clinical deterioration. The PIs’ long-term goal is to sense, quantify, and communicate patient’s clinical condition in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to develop the novel tools for sensing, quantifying, and communicating any patient’s condition in an autonomous, precise, and interpretable manner. The central hypothesis is that deep learning models will be superior to existing acuity clinical scores by predicting acuity in a dynamic, precise, and interpretable manner, using autonomous assessment of pain, emotional distress and physical function, together with clinical and physiologic data. The hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data and is well-grounded in clinical care literature. The rationale is that autonomous and precise patient quantification can result in enhanced clinical workflow and early intervention. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the patient’s clinical status to determine if it is more accurate in predicting daily care transition outcomes, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous visual assessment of critically ill patients to determine if it can provide accurate visual assessment of a patient compared to human expert, and if it can enrich acuity prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Implementing and evaluating an intelligent platform for real- time integration of autonomous visual assessment and acuity prediction in clinical workflow to determine accuracy in real-time prospective evaluation and to determine physicians’ risk perception and satisfaction. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise patient trajectory, (2) autonomously perform visual assessment in the ICU, and (3) implement artificial intelligence platform in real time in clinical workflow. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time prediction of clinical trajectory, (2) manual repetitive ICU assessments, and (3) uncaptured patient aspects. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making,10154047,R01EB029699,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Facial Expression', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'advanced disease', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'emotional distress', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'risk perception', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'vigilance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,632088
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258
"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in mature arterio-venous (AV) fistulas used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas with impending failure in patients who are in need of surgical intervention to ensure patency of the patient’s hemodialysis access. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of mature AV fistula sounds paired with ultrasound imaging from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with patent fistulas and patients with failing fistulas. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring for failing fistulas. During Phase I of the project we will recruit study subjects in vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics at Columbia University Medical Center. The follow-up SBIR Phase II project will extend our algorithm to account for (1) broader forms of hemodialysis access including AV grafts, which often fail more frequently than fistulas, and premature fistulas, which are often abandoned, and (2) longitudinal collection and analysis of hemodialysis access sounds at commercial dialysis centers and in patients’ homes. SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auscultation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Bluetooth', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Eko', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Fistula', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Sounds', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Research Design', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stethoscopes', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'algorithm training', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cloud software', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data streams', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'patient home care', 'premature', 'recruit', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,299358
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients. The main goal of this proposal is to use Michigan Medicine’s electronic health records to develop a tool to identify high-risk ADRD patients.",Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,10263307,K01AG068361,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diet', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Discrimination', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Social Workers', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'health data', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'premature', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,130140
"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317
"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10250533,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anger', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Frustration', 'Home environment', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'United States', 'Universities', 'aging in place', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal support', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'loved ones', 'member', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online community', 'prototype', 'smart watch', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,196867
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases. PROJECT SUMMARY Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. The rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNOW proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNOW is developing the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms to guide any non-trained people to correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving the management of chronic diseases. In Phase I, we validated the feasibility of our product by developing a module for heart stethoscope exams. Users were able to autonomously take a phonocardiogram measurement in <8 seconds, while the system verified the correct use of the device. In this Phase II project, the additional modules required for a minimum viable product (MVP) with significant clinical and commercial impact will be developed. This will include modules for Respiratory Auscultation, Otoscopic Ear Examination, Mouth Examination, and temperature control. The developed modules will be then integrated within the current front-end structure. The MVP will be validated in a clinical setting, where its usability, benefits, and clinical effectiveness will be assessed. Additionally, the platform will be integrated with major providers of Electronic Health Records. At the end of this SBIR Phase II project, an MVP ready to enter the market will have been fully developed. Future R&D efforts of AdviNOW Medical will be aimed at the development of Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis of abnormal medical conditions from self-measured biometric parameters. The mission of AdviNOW Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class II medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions.

"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,10116356,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,202917
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",10199784,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2021,100000
"Improving antibiotic treatment decisions through machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Infections from antibiotic resistant bacteria represent one of the biggest challenges facing modern medical care. Suboptimal antibiotic use is one of the major drivers for antibiotic resistance, however clinicians lack robust tools to help them make rational treatment decisions at the patient-level. The goal of this 3-year mentored clinical scientist research career development program is to apply state-of-the-art machine learning models to routinely collected data in the electronic health record to predict the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prior to, and after antibiotic treatment. The candidate, Dr. Sanjat Kanjilal, has identified two important clinical problems where improved risk prediction for AMR could have a significant impact on quality of care. The first is the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients presenting with community-onset sepsis. To address this, the candidate will develop a set of machine learning prediction models trained on routinely collected data in the electronic health record to help clinicians identify which antibiotic(s) will effectively treat the patient's pathogen while being of the narrowest possible spectrum. The second problem is the inability to assess the risk of a patient developing an antibiotic resistant infection after being treated with an antibiotic. The candidate proposes to build a robust causal inference model using targeted maximum likelihood estimation combined with machine learning to estimate the impact of taking various commonly used outpatient antibiotics on the risk of developing a drug resistant infection in the 12 month period after treatment. The results of this work will form the basis of a precision medicine approach to antibiotic stewardship and treatment. The candidate is a practicing infectious diseases clinician and the Associate Medical Director of the clinical microbiology laboratory at the Brigham & Women's Hospital. He has prior experience in building machine learning algorithms that provide robust antimicrobial stewardship. His unique background combined with the rich supporting environment of the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, position him well for the transition to becoming an independently funded clinician- scientist working at the interface of infectious diseases and machine learning. He has assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team consisting of experts in sepsis epidemiology, antimicrobial stewardship, implementation science, machine learning and causal inference to help him achieve his goals and has identified a comprehensive training plan that provides him the skills necessary to become a leader in his field. His short term goal is to become an expert in the development of machine learning algorithms that improve decision making for antibiotic resistant infections. His medium term goal is to deploy these models at scale and evaluate their real-world utility with randomized trials. The candidate's long term goal is to use these algorithms and the infrastructure necessary to maintain them as the technologic basis, of a learning health system that provides personalized decision support at the provider and public health level. NARRATIVE Modern medicine is under threat from antibiotic resistant bacteria, which kill more than 35,000 people every year in the United States. This project will apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to routinely collected data in the electronic health record to predict the risk of antibiotic resistance for patients presenting with sepsis as well as the risk someone will have a drug- resistant infection after they are treated with an antibiotic. The results of this research will lay the foundation for a data-driven approach to antibiotic treatment that optimizes the needs of the patient with the need to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens.",Improving antibiotic treatment decisions through machine learning,10301631,K08HS027841,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2021,149505
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'risk prediction']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,10219347,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2021,118570
"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,10163257,R01LM011834,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Information Dissemination', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'simulation', 'success']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654500
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10199999,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large scale data', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,241504
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",10064003,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2021,249000
"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10202727,R01HS026246,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,396733
"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10212944,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558490
"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy.

"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'remote monitoring', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",10120737,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk prediction', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645032
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,10165820,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,345325
"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,10074511,R01AG062436,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Judgment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive treatment', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Suggestion', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Warfarin', 'administrative database', 'care delivery', 'cognitive load', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'routine practice', 'shared decision making', 'stroke risk', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,493168
"ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention Project Summary Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention,10178157,R01NS120924,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient mobility', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'sound', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,612618
"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions.

"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10266121,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'rural area', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'underserved area', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,1048978
"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,10204071,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness testing', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2021,527496
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pressure', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Extravasation', 'Fatigue', 'Freedom', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injections', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mattresses', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'Negligence', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Protocols', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Recommendation', 'Rest', 'Scourge', 'Shoulder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Width', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'tool']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobili- zation to patients at risk for long-term disability.",Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU),10232391,K23HL148387,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development Plans', 'Early Mobilizations', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based practice', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incentives', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physical therapy', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial implementation', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'disability', 'disability risk', 'early phase clinical trial', 'effectiveness implementation study', 'effectiveness implementation trial', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'functional disability', 'functional improvement', 'functional independence', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'skills', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K23,2021,162432
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability. Implementation of a 30-day digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF patients may provide support for similar interventions in larger HF/cardiovascular populations by reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement.",Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure,10084315,K23HL150287,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Community Health Aides', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Research', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Singapore', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical care', 'cohesion', 'comorbidity', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'health difference', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'readmission rates', 'social', 'social factors', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,198857
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),10129429,P50MH115846,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Outreach', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education and Outreach', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'North America', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'design', 'faculty community', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'web site']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2021,1640084
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),10105371,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,514581
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,10188627,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,177788
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,10120705,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,185808
